I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They started a sexual arrangement where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author later tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended it, explaining that he's not into that. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused because they were close before.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual understanding. The author mentioned from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. The friend initiated the sexual acts, and the author agreed. There's no indication of coercion. When the author ended it, he was clear and respectful. The friend's reaction seems to be about the emotional fallout, possibly feeling used or rejected. However, the author had the right to set boundaries, especially after clarifying his orientation. The friend's behavior now is his response to the situation, but the author isn't at fault for changing his mind or setting limits. The advice from others that he led the friend on might be valid in terms of managing expectations, but the author didn't promise anything beyond what was agreed. Since both were adults and the initial arrangement was consensual, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about how the friend is handling the rejection, not the author's actions.\n"
