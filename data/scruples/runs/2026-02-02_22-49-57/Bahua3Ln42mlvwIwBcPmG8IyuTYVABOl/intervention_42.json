I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight-identified male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted a few times. Then, after a breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author later reciprocated but felt uncomfortable and ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others said it's their fault for leading the friend on, but they claim they were clear about their straight identity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are consent, mutual understanding, and boundaries. The author mentions they were clear from the start that they are straight and not interested in romantic or emotional involvement. The arrangement seems to be based on mutual consent, even if it's a bit complicated. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows they respected the relationship. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. When the author felt bad about the one-sided nature, they reciprocated but felt awful and ended it. \n\nThe friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant might stem from feeling used or unappreciated. The author's actions might have led to mixed signals, even if unintentionally. The friend might have hoped for more than just a physical relationship, but the author was clear they are straight. However, engaging in regular sexual activity with a friend can blur boundaries, even if both parties think it's casual. The author's decision to reciprocate once might have crossed a line from the friend's perspective, making them feel more involved than they wanted to be. \n\nOthers on the sub said the author led the friend on, which is a common criticism in such situations. The author might not have intended to, but the act of having ongoing sexual encounters could be seen as fostering a dependency or expectation from the friend. The author's subsequent decision to stop after reciprocating could have been hurtful. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties consented and there was no deceit, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author might have needed to communicate better from the start. The fact that the friend became distant suggests that the arrangement affected their friendship negatively. The author might need to reflect on whether they were as clear as they thought about their intentions and if their actions inadvertently caused emotional harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the author's actions, while consensual, might have led to the friend feeling used or unappreciated, making the author partially at fault. So, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if there was consent, the ongoing dynamic might have created unspoken expectations that the author didn't consider.\n"
