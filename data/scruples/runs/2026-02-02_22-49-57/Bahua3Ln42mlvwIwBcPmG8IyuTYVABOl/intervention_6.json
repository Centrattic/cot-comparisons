I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then broke things off, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author is heteroflexible, so he's not entirely straight but leans that way. The friend is gay and offered a blowjob. The author accepted because he was single and horny. Then when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, they resumed. Then the author felt bad, reciprocated, but felt awful and stopped again. Now the friend is cold.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims from the start it was clear he's not interested romantically. The friend is gay, so maybe he was hoping for more than just oral sex? But the author didn't indicate any romantic interest. The author also tried to apologize and explain things, but the friend is now distant. The author is confused because they were best friends before this started.\n\nSome people said it's the author's fault for leading him on, but the author argues he was clear. The key points are consent and communication. Both were adults, and there was no forced activity. The author didn't promise anything more than what was agreed. When he felt uncomfortable reciprocating, he communicated that. The friend's reaction might be about feeling used or rejected, but if there was no expectation of a relationship, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the ongoing arrangement might have created emotional attachment, even if the author didn't intend to. The author might have been selfish in his actions, but not necessarily in the wrong. It's a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were deceitful or if the friend misinterpreted the situation.\n"
