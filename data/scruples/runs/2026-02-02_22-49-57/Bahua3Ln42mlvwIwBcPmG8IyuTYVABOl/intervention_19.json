I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves two 18-year-old males. The author, who identifies as straight but heteroflexible, had a friend who's gay offer to give him a blowjob. They did this for weeks/months, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt bad and reciprocated, then decided to stop. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author was clear about his orientation. The author didn't lead the friend on; he was honest about not being interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. They had a mutual understanding. When the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity, but the author later felt uncomfortable and ended it. The friend's reaction is now making the author doubt himself.\n\nThe community suggested the author is at fault for leading the friend on. But the author argues he was clear about his stance. The key points here are consent, honesty, and boundaries. Both parties entered the arrangement consensually. The friend might have hoped for a deeper connection, but the author was upfront. The author ending the arrangement after reciprocating doesn't seem to be a betrayal if there was no prior agreement about exclusivity or emotional involvement. The friend's hurt feelings might stem from unspoken expectations, but the author's actions were based on his own comfort and honesty. Since both acted consensually and the author communicated his boundaries, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
