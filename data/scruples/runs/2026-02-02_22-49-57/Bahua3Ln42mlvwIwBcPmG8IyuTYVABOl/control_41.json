I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After a breakup, they resumed the activity, then the author stopped reciprocating and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is distant, and others say the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. Both are adults (18), so legally, if they agreed, there's no crime. The author made it clear they're not gay or into kissing, so maybe the friend understood boundaries. However, when the author decided to stop, maybe the friend felt rejected. The author tried to explain they felt bad, but the friend's reaction is coldness. The author is confused because they thought they weren't leading on.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the friend might have developed feelings beyond just the physical. The author's actions could have given the friend hope for a deeper connection, even if the author never intended that. Ending the arrangement without clear communication might have hurt the friend's feelings. Also, the fact that the author had a girlfriend and then went back to the friend after a breakup might complicate things, as the friend might have felt like a substitute.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally or ethically if everything was consensual and boundaries were clear. But in terms of friendship, the friend's reaction shows emotional hurt, which the author might be responsible for, even unintentionally. The author's actions, while not necessarily malicious, could have caused emotional damage. So, while not \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, the author might have been inconsiderate, leading to the friend's current behavior. The advice to leave the friend alone might be because the friend needs space, but the author is struggling because they value the friendship. The answer depends on whether intent or impact matters more. If the question is about being in the wrong in terms of causing harm, maybe A. If it's about legal or ethical wrongdoing, maybe B. But the user is likely asking about social wrong, so A might be more appropriate here. But some would argue B because the author tried to communicate and stop. Hmm.\n"
