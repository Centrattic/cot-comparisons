I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight-identified person who had a sexual arrangement with their gay friend. They had consensual oral sex multiple times. Then, after getting a girlfriend, they stopped, and when the relationship ended, resumed. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then decided to stop again, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties were adults (18), and there's no indication of coercion. The author was clear about their orientation and the nature of the relationship. The friend was also aware and agreed. However, the author changed their mind later, which can be a valid decision as consent can be withdrawn at any time. The problem arises when the friend is upset about the sudden stop and the author is confused about the friend's reaction.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since both were adults and there was no non-consensual act, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Emotionally, though, the friend might have felt hurt or used, which is a common issue in such situations. The author's actions, while not illegal, might have been emotionally impactful on their friend. The advice from others that the author led them on could be partially true if the friend felt there was an implied commitment or emotional connection beyond the physical.\n\nHowever, the author tried to communicate their feelings and even apologized. The friend's coldness is their reaction, not the author's fault per se. The main question is whether the author had the right to change their mind after the arrangement was established. Since consent is ongoing, the author can revoke it, but they might have a responsibility to consider their friend's feelings in doing so. The author might have been abrupt in stopping, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily unethical. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's nuanced. Legally, no. Ethically, maybe partially. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, and considering the parameters of the question, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they might have neglected their friend's emotional state, even if there was initial consent. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because they communicated their decision. The community's split, but given the explanation, I think the answer is A.\n"
