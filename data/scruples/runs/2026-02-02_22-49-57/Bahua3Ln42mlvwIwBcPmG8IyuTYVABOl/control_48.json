I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual male who had a male friend. The friend offered to perform oral sex, and the author agreed while he was single and horny. They continued this arrangement for weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the oral sex. Later, the author felt guilty and reciprocated, but felt terrible and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is being cold and distant, and the author is confused because others say he's at fault.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were wrong. Let's look at the key points. The author claims to be straight and heteroflexible, which means he might have some level of attraction to men but primarily to women. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men, which aligns with him offering oral sex. However, the author's actions involve engaging in sexual activity with a friend, which might be a boundary issue.\n\nThe author says there was no emotional intimacy or romantic involvement; it was just physical. However, engaging in sexual acts with a friend, even if platonic, can complicate the relationship. When the author started dating someone, he stopped, which is good. But after the breakup, resuming the oral sex might have led the friend to hope for more, especially since the author is in a position where he's single again.\n\nWhen the author reciprocated, he realized it wasn't right for him and ended the arrangement. The friend's reaction of being distant could be due to feeling used or rejected. The author might not have been clear about his intentions all along. Even if he was honest about being straight, the act of engaging in sexual activities might have given the friend false hope. The author's decision to reciprocate briefly could have confused the friend's expectations.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author reached out and the friend was dismissive suggests that the friend feels hurt. The community's response that the author led the friend on might be valid because consistent sexual activity without clear boundaries can be misleading. Even if the author was upfront, actions can speak louder than words. The author might have created a situation where the friend felt emotionally invested, leading to hurt feelings when it ended.\n\nIn terms of ethics, consent was present, but the emotional impact on the friend is significant. The author might have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings by not maintaining clear boundaries from the start. Ending the arrangement abruptly after reciprocating could have been harsh. The author's responsibility here is to consider how his actions affect the friend, even if the initial interactions were consensual.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not maintaining clear boundaries throughout, leading to the friend's hurt and the breakdown of the friendship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
