I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but isn't gay. The friend is gay and offered a Blowjob. The author accepted, which might be a problem because even if he's open, the friend might have felt it was a one-sided arrangement. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but resumed after the breakup. The author then reciprocated, felt bad, and ended things. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nThe key points are consent and communication. The author didn't force anything; the friend offered. But the author might have led the friend to believe there was more to the relationship than just a sexual arrangement. The friend might have hoped for something more or felt used. The author's actions could have caused emotional harm, even if unintended. Also, the friend being gay and the author being straight might mean the author wasn't emotionally invested, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe author tried to explain and apologize, but the friend is still upset. The people in the sub said it's the author's fault for leading on, which suggests that the author might have given false signals. The author claims it was clear he wasn't interested romantically, but actions can sometimes contradict words. The friend might have felt that the author was using him for sexual favors without reciprocating emotionally.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't force anything, but the arrangement might have been exploitative. The friend's feelings of being used or not respected could make the author at fault. The author ending things abruptly after reciprocating might have been a shock, and not handling it sensitively could have worsened the situation. The answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author may have participated in a dynamic that the friend found hurtful, even if unintentionally.\n"
