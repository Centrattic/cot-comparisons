I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight guy who had a gay friend who offered him blowjobs. They did this a few times over weeks or months, then when he got a girlfriend, they stopped. After she dumped him, they started again. Then he felt bad and reciprocated, but it made him uncomfortable, so he told his friend to stop. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clear he's straight and heteroflexible. The friend is gay, so maybe there's an unspoken expectation about the nature of their interaction. The key points are consent and mutual understanding from the start. The author didn't promise anything beyond the physical act; he didn't lead on emotionally. But maybe the friend developed feelings or expected a deeper relationship. \n\nThe author did reciprocate once, which might have confused the friend. Even though the author said it made him feel sick and clarified he wasn't into that, maybe the friend felt used. The author tried to reach out, but the friend became distant. The question is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. \n\nLegally and in terms of consent, as long as both parties agreed and no one was coerced, it's a private matter. However, in terms of friendship and emotional impact, the author might have caused hurt by engaging in a physical relationship that the friend might have wanted to be more. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have been abrupt, leading to the friend's resentment. \n\nBut the author claims he was clear about his boundaries and didn't lead on. The friend might have had unspoken expectations. The author isn't in the wrong if there was mutual consent and no deception. However, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to take responsibility for ending the arrangement abruptly, even if it was necessary for his own comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. If the friend expected a romantic relationship and the author didn't, that's a miscommunication. But the author was honest from the start. The answer might hinge on whether there was any deception. If the author was clear, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the friend felt used, maybe there's some accountability. However, the author's actions were within his rights as long as consent was mutual. So probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
