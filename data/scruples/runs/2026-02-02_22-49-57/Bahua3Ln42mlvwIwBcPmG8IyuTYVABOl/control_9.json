I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a specific situation involving a gay friend offering and providing blowjobs, then stopping after getting a girlfriend and later feeling uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but heteroflexible. They had a friend who's gay and offered this sexual activity. The author accepted and continued for a while. Then they got a girlfriend, stopped the arrangement, which the friend was okay with. After a breakup, they resumed, but the author later reciprocated and realized they felt bad about it. They told the friend to stop, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. Both parties initially agreed to the arrangement. However, when the author started reciprocating and then stopped, it might have caused confusion or emotional hurt for the friend. The friend's cold response suggests he felt rejected or used. The author's actions led to emotional distress, even if they didn't realize it. The author's initial acceptance of the friend's offers might have led the friend to believe there was potential for a romantic or deeper connection, which wasn't there. Even though the author clarified they were straight, the friend might have hoped for more. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have felt like a betrayal or rejection from the friend's perspective, despite the author's intentions. The advice given in the sub suggests that leading someone on is wrong, and the author might have done that, even unintentionally. So, considering emotional impact and the friend's feelings, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their actions and sudden withdrawal affected their friend.\n"
