I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. The friend became distant after the author reciprocated and then stopped. The author is confused because his friends say he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's not interested in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his friend had a mutual understanding that the sexual activity was part of a casual arrangement. The author was honest about his orientation and never intended a romantic relationship. When the friend initiated the activity again after the author's breakup, the author reciprocated once but felt uncomfortable and ended it. The friend's reaction is now making the author question his actions.\n\nKey points to consider: mutual consent at the start, the author's honesty about his orientation, the fact that they stopped when the author started a relationship, and the friend's reaction after the author reciprocated but then stopped. The author's actions seem to be within the bounds of their initial agreement, but the friend might have developed feelings or felt used, leading to the cold response.\n\nThe challenge here is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Since there was no deception from the author's side and the friend might have misinterpreted the arrangement, the onus could be on the friend to manage his own expectations. However, the act of reciprocating once might have given the friend false hope, even if the author quickly clarified. The author's friends suggest he led the friend on, which could be a valid point if the friend felt the reciprocation was a sign of interest, but the author's intention was to maintain the original arrangement. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author didn't lie and tried to communicate his boundaries. The friend's reaction is more about his own feelings than the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's a nuance where reciprocating might have been a mistake, even if brief. But since the author immediately communicated his discomfort, it's more about the friend's inability to handle the rejection. So, the answer leans towards B (No), but with the understanding that the author could have been more careful in reciprocating.\n"
