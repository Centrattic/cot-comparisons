I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a straight guy (the author) had a gay friend who offered to give him blowjobs. They did this a few times when the author was single, then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Then the author felt guilty, returned the favor, but immediately regretted it and told his friend they should stop. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear about being straight.\n\nFirst, the friend is gay, but he initiated the sexual activity. The author was single and willing at first. But when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good. But when the girlfriend broke up, they resumed. Then the author reciprocated, felt bad, and ended it. The friend is upset now. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't force the friend; the friend offered. However, the act of returning the favor might have confused things. The author claims he's straight, but engaging in oral sex with a man, even if it's just the one time, could be problematic. Also, the friend might have hoped for a more committed relationship or felt used. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for not being clear enough about his intentions from the start. Even if he's heteroflexible, the friend might have felt like he was being treated as a means for sexual gratification without emotional reciprocity. The fact that the author reciprocated and then immediately regretted it could have made the friend feel hurt or rejected. Also, after breaking up, the author might have thought it was okay to resume the arrangement, but the friend might have had different feelings or expectations. \n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't set boundaries early on. Even if he's heterosexual, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can lead to complications, especially when emotions are involved. The friend might have developed feelings or felt that the author was using him. The author's actions, while based on his own orientation, could have been careless in terms of the friend's emotional state. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't explicitly lead the friend on, the ongoing arrangement without clear boundaries might have been confusing. The friend's reaction is understandable as he might feel hurt and disrespected. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate of the friend's feelings and the nature of their friendship.\n"
