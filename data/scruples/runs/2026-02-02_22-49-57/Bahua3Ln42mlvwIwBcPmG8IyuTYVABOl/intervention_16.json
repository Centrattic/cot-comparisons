I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused because they thought it was clear they were just having fun without deeper feelings.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is heteroflexible, which means they might be open to same-sex experiences but aren't exclusively gay. The friend is gay, so he's into the author. They had a mutual arrangement where the friend performed oral sex, and later the author reciprocated but felt uncomfortable and stopped. The friend became distant, leading the author to question their actions.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The initial interactions were consensual, so there's no forced activity. However, the author's friend might have developed feelings beyond just the arrangement. When the author reciprocated, even if they felt awful and stopped, that act might have given the friend false hope. The author's friend being gay might mean he was looking for more than a casual encounter, especially since the author initially accepted the offer. \n\nAlso, when the author's girlfriend broke up, they resumed the arrangement. Then, when the author tried to reciprocate and felt bad, stopping it might have left the friend feeling rejected or confused. The author's friend's coldness could stem from feeling used or rejected after the author's actions. The author's message about not leading him on might not align with the friend's perception if he thought there was potential for more.\n\nEven though the author is straight and heteroflexible, the way they handled the ending of the arrangement could have been hurtful. The friend might have wanted more, and the author's actions, like reciprocating and then stopping, could have been confusing. The author might not have clearly communicated their boundaries from the start, leading the friend to have unrealistic expectations.\n\nSo, while there's no malice, the author might be at fault for not managing the situation with more care and clarity, leading the friend to feel led on. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
