I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy accepting blowjobs from his gay friend, then later ending it after getting a girlfriend and breaking up. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused about why he's being blamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are 18, so minors in some places, but the question might be more about social ethics. The author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author accepted without pressure. Then, when the author started dating someone, they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed, and the author later felt uncomfortable and tried to stop it, even offering to reciprocate once, which made him feel worse. He told the friend it wasn't him, but the friend became distant.\n\nThe author is confused because he didn't lead on the friend; he was honest about his orientation. However, the friend might have developed emotional attachment or felt used. The key points are consent, honesty, and the friend's reaction. The author seems to have been upfront, but maybe the friend expected more from the arrangement. The author tried to be respectful when ending it, but the friend is still upset. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author acted inconsiderately. He stopped the activity when he was in a relationship, which is responsible. When he ended it again, he did so politely. The friend's reaction seems more about personal feelings and expectations than the author's actions. So, the author probably isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer might be B.\n"
