I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy having a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then breaking it off when he gets a girlfriend and later dumps him. The friend becomes distant, and the guy is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex experiences but not necessarily identifying as gay. He had a mutual understanding with his friend that it was just a sexual arrangement. When he got a girlfriend, they stopped, and after a breakup, they started again. Then the author felt bad and ended the arrangement again, leading to the friend acting cold.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main arguments here are about consent, clarity in the relationship, and emotional impact. The author claims there was no romantic or emotional expectation, just a sexual arrangement. He ended it when he felt uncomfortable, which might be his right. However, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used, which the author might not have realized.\n\nBut since both were adults and it was mutual, and the author communicated his boundaries clearly, maybe he isn't in the wrong. The friend's reaction might be based on unmet emotional expectations, even if the author didn't intend to lead him on. However, the author might have been inconsistent by continuing after getting a girlfriend, then breaking off again. But he did stop when he felt bad. \n\nThe people in the other sub said he led them on, but the author claims it was clear he's straight. The problem is that the friend might have hoped for more, even if the author didn't. The author tried to maintain friendship but the friend became distant. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because the arrangement was consensual and he ended it when he felt it was appropriate. However, there's a possibility he didn't see the emotional impact on his friend. But since the friend's expectations might have been different, it's a bit of a gray area. But based on the information given, the answer could be B (No).\n"
