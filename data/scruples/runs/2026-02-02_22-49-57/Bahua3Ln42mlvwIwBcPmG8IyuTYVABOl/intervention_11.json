I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male engaging in a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ending it, leading to tension in their friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his friend started an arrangement where the friend performed oral sex on him. They stopped when the author had a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The author felt guilty and ended the arrangement, causing the friend to become distant. The author is being told by others that he led the friend on, but he argues he was clear about his orientation and boundaries.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. Let's consider consent and boundaries. The author didn't force anything on his friend; they agreed to the arrangement. However, continuing the relationship after the author had a girlfriend could be problematic, as it might be considered cheating. But the author stopped when he had a girlfriend, which suggests he respected that boundary at the time.\n\nWhen the author ended the arrangement again after the breakup, he tried to be respectful. The issue now is the friend's reaction. The author is concerned about losing a friend but believes he was honest. Others have criticized him for leading the friend on. The challenge here is whether the author's actions, though consensual, created unrealistic expectations or emotional harm.\n\nThe friend's hurt feelings could be due to feeling used or not genuinely cared for. Even if the author was clear about not wanting a romantic relationship, the ongoing sexual relationship might have led to unspoken emotional investments. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have been confusing or hurtful to the friend, even if done kindly.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were consensual and within their stated boundaries. He was honest about his orientation and their arrangement wasn't a romantic relationship. The problem might lie in the friend's own expectations or inability to handle the end of the arrangement. The author isn't in a position to control how the friend feels, but he might be responsible for considering the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties consented and there's no coercion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, relationships, even casual ones, can have emotional consequences. The author might have a responsibility to manage the end of the arrangement with sensitivity, but he did attempt to communicate his feelings. The friend's withdrawal could be a personal reaction rather than the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. The problem is more about the friend's handling of the situation and possible expectations that weren't met. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
