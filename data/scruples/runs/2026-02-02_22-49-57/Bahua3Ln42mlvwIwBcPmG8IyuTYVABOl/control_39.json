I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when the author was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt bad and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the key points are consent and clear communication. The author claims it was clear from the start he's straight and not interested romantically. The friend was gay, so maybe he had different expectations. The author had sex with him, then stopped, which might have made the friend feel rejected or used. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend might have felt the arrangement was a form of intimacy that was suddenly cut off, causing hurt feelings. The author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on if there was any ambiguity in communication. Also, the friend's reaction suggests he felt wronged. The author's responsibility includes considering how his actions affect others, even if he didn't mean to. So, while the friend's reaction is harsh, the author might still be at fault for not being clear or for not addressing the friend's feelings properly. The answer might be A, Yes, because the author's actions, even if consensual, could have been hurtful and he didn't handle the end of the arrangement sensitively.\n"
