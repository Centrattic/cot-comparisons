I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend, it stopped, then resumed after the breakup. The guy then tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now his friend is distant.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he's mostly straight but open to same-sex encounters. The friend is gay and offered a blowjob, which the author accepted. The key here is the nature of their relationship. They were friends, and the author didn't lead him on in terms of emotional attachment. The author made it clear he wasn't into the friend romantically. \n\nWhen the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows some consideration. But after the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. Then the author tried to reciprocate, felt bad, and ended it. The friend became distant. The author is confused because others say he's in the wrong for leading him on, but he didn't make any emotional promises. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if there were no emotional promises, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used. The author's actions could have caused emotional harm. The friend might feel rejected or that the author used his affection. Also, the author's friend is gay, so maybe the dynamic was different. The author might not realize that for someone who is gay, the act of receiving a blowjob isn't the same as giving one. The friend might have felt that the author was reciprocating in a way that was meaningful to him, but the author rejected it, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nThe author tried to explain he wasn't into that, but maybe the friend took it as rejection beyond just the act. The author's friend's coldness suggests he's still hurting. The author's message about trying to stay friends might not have addressed the underlying issues. So, even if there were no explicit promises, the author might have overlooked the friend's emotional needs. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider the friend's feelings, leading to emotional harm. But others might argue that as long as there were no expectations, it's not his fault. However, in relationships, especially friendships, unspoken expectations can exist. The author's actions might have created a situation where the friend felt used or unappreciated. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
