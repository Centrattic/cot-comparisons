I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual relationship with a gay friend. They started when he was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author later felt uncomfortable and stopped reciprocating, which led to the friend becoming distant. The friends in the sub said the author led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight from the start.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author was upfront about his orientation, and the friend was okay with the arrangement. However, when the author ended the relationship again, the friend became cold. The author is confused because he thought they were clear, but people say leading on is wrong.\n\nBut wait, the author was honest about his feelings and boundaries. The friend initiated the arrangement, and it was mutual. The author even tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and communicated that clearly. The problem arises after the author stops, leading to the friend's withdrawal. The author is trying to maintain the friendship but faces resistance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was never deceptive and communicated his stance clearly, then perhaps he's not at fault. The friend's reaction could stem from emotional hurt, especially if he had feelings beyond just the physical. However, the author did end the relationship when he felt it was appropriate. The friend might have expected a different outcome. But the author's actions were within his boundaries and he communicated them. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that engaging in a one-sided sexual relationship could lead to emotional strain, even if boundaries are clear. However, given the information provided, the author seems to have acted with honesty and respect.\n"
