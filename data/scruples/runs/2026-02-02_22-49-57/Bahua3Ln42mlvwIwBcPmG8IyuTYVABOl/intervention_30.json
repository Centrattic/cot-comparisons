I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then stopped because he felt bad, and now the friend is being distant. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is straight but described as heteroflexible, which I think means he's open to some same-sex experiences but not necessarily into relationships. He had a friend who is gay and offered him a blowjob, which he accepted. They continued this for some time. Then, when he got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Later, he reciprocated but felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is being cold, and others say the author led him on.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The author was clear about his orientation and never reciprocated in a romantic way. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author accepted. The problem arises when the author stops, and the friend is upset. \n\nThe question is about consent and boundaries. The author was upfront about his stance, and the friendship turned sexual without explicit romantic or emotional commitment. However, when the author ended the arrangement, the friend felt rejected. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author didn't have malicious intent. He was honest about his limitations and tried to maintain the friendship. The friend's reaction is hurt, but perhaps the author isn't at fault for not seeing the situation as manipulative. However, some might argue that accepting the friend's advances could lead to emotional dependence, even if unintended. But since the author was clear from the start and stopped when he felt uncomfortable, it's possible he's not in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friendship. If the author's actions caused the friend to feel used or unappreciated, that's a problem. But the friend's emotional response might be his responsibility to manage. The author tried to resolve things by communicating and even reaching out later. \n\nIn summary, the author made a mistake in perhaps not considering the emotional impact on the friend, but given the circumstances and his honesty, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The friend's reaction might stem from unmet emotional needs, not the author's intent. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
