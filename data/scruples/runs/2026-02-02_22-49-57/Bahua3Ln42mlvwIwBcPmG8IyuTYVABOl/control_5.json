I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy engaging in sexual acts with his gay friend, then stopping and causing a rift.\n\nFirst, point 1: The author is heteroflexible and accepted a blowjob from his gay friend. They were both 18, so legally of age. The friend initiated, and the author was single and horny at the time. It's mutual, so maybe not wrong here.\n\nPoint 2: They continued the arrangement for weeks/months. Still seems consensual. Then he gets a girlfriend, they stop, and the friend is okay. Then the girlfriend dumps him, and they resume. The author later reciprocates but feels bad and stops. The friend becomes distant.\n\nThe author tried to reach out but the friend is cold. Others say he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. The key issue here is whether the author's actions were leading the friend on, even if there was no romantic intent.\n\nThe friend is gay, so he's likely seeking emotional and physical connection. The author's actions might have given false hope, even if he wasn't interested romantically. The fact that the author stopped after reciprocating and tried to communicate shows he tried to be honest. But the friend might feel used or that the author wasn't upfront about his feelings or intentions. \n\nHowever, the author didn't lie about being straight. The problem is that the friend might have hoped for a deeper connection, and the author's actions, though not romantic, might have made him feel like he was just a sexual partner. The author's responsibility here is in setting clear boundaries from the start. By engaging in the sexual activity without a clear understanding of what the relationship meant, he might have contributed to the confusion. \n\nBut since the author was honest about his orientation and ended the physical relationship when he felt uncomfortable, it's a bit nuanced. The friend's reaction might be more about unmet emotional needs than the author being in the wrong. Still, in such situations, even if consensual, the emotional impact on the other person matters. The author might have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings by not addressing the emotional aspect of their interactions. \n\nSo, considering all points, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he might have led the friend on emotionally, even if unintentionally, by continuing the physical relationship without addressing the friend's potential emotional needs. Alternatively, if the friend's actions were entirely consensual and the author was upfront, it could be B. But since others in the sub said he led the friend on, and the friend's distress is valid, the answer might be A.\n"
