I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is a straight heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend offer him a blowjob. They had this arrangement for a while, then the author got a girlfriend and stopped. After breaking up with the girlfriend, they resumed, but then the author felt bad and stopped again, causing the friend to become distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. If both parties agreed to the arrangement and there was no pressure or coercion, maybe it's not the author's fault. The author mentions that it was clear from the start that he's straight and wouldn't reciprocate emotionally. But the friend might have had different expectations or feelings, even if it wasn't verbalized. \n\nThe issue arises when the author's girlfriend dumps him, leading to resuming the arrangement. Then, when the author decides to stop again, the friend feels betrayed. The friend might feel that the author led him on, even if the author thought he was clear about his boundaries. The author's message to the friend over Christmas was dismissed, which could indicate that the friend is hurt and needs space.\n\nThe author is now concerned about being the bad guy since friends are supposed to be there for each other, but the friend's actions suggest that the trust was broken. The key points are whether the author was clear about his intentions from the beginning and if he acted in a way that was respectful and not manipulative. \n\nSince the author tried to communicate his boundaries and stopped when he felt uncomfortable, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, engaging in such a relationship, even if consensual, might complicate the friendship. The friend's reaction could be due to feeling used or unappreciated, even if the author didn't intend to. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that having a sexual relationship with a friend, even if non-reciprocal, can create an imbalance and emotional distress. The author might have misjudged how the friend would feel about the one-sided arrangement. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong because, even with clear communication, the actions could have caused emotional harm to the friend. The friend's withdrawal suggests that the trust was damaged, and the author might need to respect the friend's need for space, even if he feels it's unjust.\n"
