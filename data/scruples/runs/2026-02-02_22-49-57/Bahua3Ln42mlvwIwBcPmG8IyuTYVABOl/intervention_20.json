I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The scenario involves two male friends, one straight and heteroflexible, the other gay. They had an arrangement where the gay friend gave the straight friend blowjobs. Then the straight friend got a girlfriend, they stopped, the girlfriend broke up, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the straight friend reciprocated and then decided to stop, leading to the gay friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both parties agreed to the arrangement from the start. The author mentioned that they were clear about their orientation and that there was no expectation of romantic involvement. The key points here are that both were adults, 18 years old, and the activities were consensual. \n\nHowever, when the straight friend got a girlfriend, they stopped the arrangement, which shows some level of respect for their relationship. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. The author then tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended things. The issue arises when the friend became cold. The author tried to reconnect, but the friend was unresponsive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but others in a different sub said it's the author's fault for leading him on. The author argues they didn't lead him on and were clear about their intentions.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, since they're 18 and the acts are consensual, there's no issue there. Ethically, it's about how the situation was handled. The author may have made the friend feel used or unappreciated, especially when they reciprocated but then ended things. However, the author was honest about their limits and tried to communicate. The friend's reaction is also a factor\u2014becoming distant and unresponsive might be an overreaction, possibly due to unexpressed feelings or hurt pride.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author is concerned about losing a best friend. The author's actions, while not illegal, might have caused emotional harm. However, if the friend is reacting negatively to the breakup of their mutual arrangement, it's more about the friend's inability to handle rejection or his own emotions. The author didn't force the situation; it was mutual. The main mistake might be not considering how the friend would feel about the arrangement ending, especially after reciprocating once.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They were honest, consensual, and tried to maintain the friendship. The friend's coldness is more about his own handling of the situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
