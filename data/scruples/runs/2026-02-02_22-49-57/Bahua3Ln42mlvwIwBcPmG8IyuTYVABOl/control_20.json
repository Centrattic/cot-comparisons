I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then getting a girlfriend, the friend being okay when they stopped, then the girlfriend dumped them and they resumed the BJ stuff, then felt bad and tried to get him to stop, leading to the friend being cold and distant. The user is confused because others say it's their fault for leading the friend on, but they claim it was clear they were straight and not interested in a romantic relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The user is engaging in a sexual activity with a close friend, which might be okay in some contexts, but when a romantic relationship is involved, that's a problem. So when they got a girlfriend, continuing the BJ arrangement could be considered cheating or at least being in a relationship while engaging in non-consensual or non-disclosed sexual activities with another person. But the friend was cool with it when they stopped initially. Then, after the breakup, they started again, which might have been a mistake if the friend still had feelings or if there was an unspoken expectation of something more. \n\nWhen the user finally had a change of heart and stopped, the friend became distant. The user feels bad and wants to reconcile because they were close friends. However, the friend might have felt used or that the user was only interested in their sexual services, not the friendship. The user's actions could be seen as disrespectful towards the friend's feelings, even if they didn't mean to lead them on. The friend might have developed emotional attachments, and the user's withdrawal could have hurt them. \n\nAlso, the fact that the user is 18 and male is important. At that age, people might be exploring their sexuality and relationships, but there's still an expectation of mutual respect. The user didn't explicitly deny the friend's feelings or the arrangement, which could have been a point where they should have set clearer boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friend's feelings. The user might have thought it was a straightforward arrangement, but sexual relationships can develop emotional components that are hard to control. By stopping abruptly after reciprocating, the user could have caused emotional distress. The friend's reaction (being cold, not engaging) is a sign of hurt, which the user might not have anticipated. \n\nSo, even if the user didn't intend to lead the friend on, the lack of clear communication and the abrupt ending after the friend provided a service might make them at fault. The friend's feelings were likely hurt, and the user didn't consider the potential emotional impact. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the user is in the wrong) because they didn't maintain clear boundaries and their actions, even if consensual, led to the friend's distress.\n"
