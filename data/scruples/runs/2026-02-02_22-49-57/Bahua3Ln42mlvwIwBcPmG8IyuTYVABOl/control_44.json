I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a one-sided sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author initiated and accepted the blowjobs from his friend, which might have set up an expectation of reciprocity or a deeper emotional connection. Even if the author considered it casual, the friend might have felt emotionally invested or used. The key points are communication and mutual understanding. The author mentioned that it was clear he's straight and not interested romantically, but maybe the friend still felt attached. \n\nWhen the author stopped the sexual activity after feeling bad for reciprocating, it might have been confusing for the friend. The author says he communicated that they should stop, but if the friend felt like their feelings weren't respected or if they had an unspoken agreement, that could cause hurt. The friend's withdrawal as a result might be a reaction to feeling used or unappreciated. \n\nThe people in the other sub said the author led the friend on, which could be true if there was an implicit understanding that the arrangement would continue. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the friend might have felt that the author took advantage of their affection. The author's confusion stems from thinking they were honest about their intentions, but maybe they didn't consider the friend's emotional needs.\n\nAlso, the friend being gay might have different expectations in such relationships. The act of receiving a blowjob without reciprocating could be seen as one-sided, especially if the friend felt their feelings weren't reciprocated. The author's decision to stop without addressing the emotional impact might have left the friend feeling rejected. \n\nSo, even though the author tried to be honest about their orientation, the ongoing sexual activity without a mutual understanding might have been a problem. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's emotional state or for not setting clearer boundaries from the start. The fact that the friend became distant suggests that the relationship was affected, and the author's actions contributed to that. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
