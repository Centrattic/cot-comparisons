I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when both were single, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to a strained friendship.\n\nFirst, the initial situation: both were adults and friends. The author was clear about their orientation. The friend offered, and the author accepted. That seems consensual. Then, when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which was appropriate. Resuming after the breakup might be where things get complicated. The author then reciprocated, which made them feel bad and led to ending the arrangement again.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author mentioned it was clear they're straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated and continued, so there's a question of whether the friend had expectations beyond the initial agreement. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if the friend felt rejected or that the arrangement was one-sided. The friend's cold reaction could be due to feeling used or disrespected, even if the author didn't intend to lead them on. However, the author was upfront about their orientation and boundaries. The friend might have had unspoken expectations or emotional attachments that weren't communicated. \n\nConsidering all that, the author tried to set boundaries and then followed through, even though it was uncomfortable. The main issue might be the lack of clear communication from the friend. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to reflect on their roles in the dynamic. The answer would be B (No), but with nuance. The author isn't in the wrong, but the situation shows the importance of clear communication in such arrangements.\n"
