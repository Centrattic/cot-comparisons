I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. They started a non-romantic arrangement where the friend offered blowjobs. The author was single at the time and agreed. They continued this for a while until the author got a girlfriend, then stopped. When the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement, explaining it wasn't part of his identity. Now, the friend is being distant and cold, leading the author to question if he's the bad guy.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. Both parties were adults (18 years old), and it seems like they had an understanding from the start. The author was clear about his orientation and the nature of their relationship. However, there could be emotional components here. The friend might have developed feelings or felt used when the arrangement stopped. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused confusion for the friend. Even if the author was clear about not being interested romantically, the friend might have felt emotionally invested or hurt.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as violating an unspoken boundary or causing emotional harm, even if there was initial consent. The fact that the friend is now distant suggests emotional hurt. The author might have a responsibility to acknowledge the impact of their actions, even if they were within agreed terms. The argument is whether the author's actions, while consensual, were respectful considering the potential for emotional consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did communicate clearly, ended the arrangement when it no longer suited them, and tried to maintain the friendship. The friend's reaction might be more about personal feelings than the author's actions being inherently wrong. The author's heteroflexibility and the non-romantic nature of the arrangement were clear from the start. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because there wasn't deceit, but the situation is complex due to emotional dynamics.\n\nBut the challenge is that even consensual actions can lead to hurt feelings if one party's needs or emotions aren't considered. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional state when ending the arrangement, possibly leading to the friend feeling rejected or devalued. The author's attempt to reciprocate and then stopping could have confused the friend, adding to the emotional mix.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is not wrong because the actions were consensual and boundaries were clear. However, from another angle, the author's decision to end the arrangement might have disregarded the friend's emotional well-being without addressing it. It's a tough call between AITA and not, depending on the emphasis on communication and emotional responsibility versus consensual agreement.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because there's no evidence of deceit or forced actions. However, the author could have handled the ending of the arrangement more sensitively, which is a separate issue from being \"in the wrong.\" The friend's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's actions, while perhaps insensitive, may not make them the bad guy in terms of wrongdoing.\n"
