I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They engaged in this several times over weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author then reciprocated by giving a Blowjob but felt bad and told the friend they needed to stop. Since then, the friend has become distant. The author is confused because they were told they led the friend on, but they claim it was clear they're straight and not interested romantically.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual consent, clear boundaries, and the subsequent fallout. The author didn't promise a romantic relationship, just physical interactions. When they ended it, the friend became upset. But the author is being told they're in the wrong for leading on, despite not having intentions beyond physical encounters. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if both parties consented and there were no false promises, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the act of reciprocating might have caused the friend to feel more attached, leading to hurt feelings when it was stopped. The author's friend could feel rejected, even if the author didn't intend to lead them on emotionally. But since the author was clear about their orientation and the friend initiated the relationship, the responsibility might lie with the friend for developing feelings they weren't prepared to handle. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to reciprocate, even if brief, might have given the friend false hope. Even if the author immediately backed out, the act of reciprocating could be seen as confusing. But the author did communicate clearly after, and the friend's reaction seems disproportionate. The author is now being blamed for leading on, which might not be entirely fair, given the lack of romantic intent.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were consensual and within the context of mutual understanding. The friend's emotional response is their own issue to deal with. The author's responsibility is to maintain honesty, which they did. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
