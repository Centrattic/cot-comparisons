I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. When the girlfriend broke up, they resumed, but the author decided to stop after reciprocating, which made him uncomfortable. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't force anything; the friend offered, and he agreed. However, there's an issue with ongoing communication. When the author ended the arrangement, maybe he didn't make it clear enough or handled the transition poorly, leading to the friend feeling hurt. Also, the friend's reaction might be due to feeling rejected or used. The author's friends said it's his fault for leading the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend to lead on, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship, then stopping, could have caused emotional harm. The friend's behavior now suggests he's upset, so the author might be responsible for not managing the end of the relationship carefully. The author also seems to care about the friendship, which shows he didn't want to hurt the friend, but the way it happened might have been confusing.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be at fault for not handling the end of the sexual relationship properly, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
