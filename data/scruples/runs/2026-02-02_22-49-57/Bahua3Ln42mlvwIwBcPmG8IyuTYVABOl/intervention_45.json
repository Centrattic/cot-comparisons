I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused because others say he led the friend on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was upfront about being straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and they both agreed to it. When the author started dating someone else, they stopped, which shows he respected boundaries. After the breakup, they resumed, but then the author felt uncomfortable and ended it again, explaining his feelings honestly.\n\nThe friend's reaction is being distant and unresponsive. The author tried to maintain the friendship but feels hurt. Others say it's his fault for leading on, but he didn't promise anything beyond physical interaction. The core issue is whether the author was wrong in continuing the arrangement, given his own orientation and the friend's feelings.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He was honest about his preferences and stopped the arrangement when he felt it was necessary. The friend might have developed feelings, but the author didn't lead him on emotionally. The responsibility for the friendship's decline might lie with the friend's unmet emotional expectations, not the author's actions. So, answer B.\n"
