I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. They started having sexual encounters, which the friend initiated. Then the author got a girlfriend, stopped the arrangement, but after breaking up, resumed it. Later, the author tried reciprocating but felt bad and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author didn't enter into a relationship with the friend, so there's no romantic involvement. The friend is gay, so he's not interested in a romantic relationship either. The author is clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in anything beyond the sexual arrangement. The problem arises when the author resumes the arrangement after breaking up, then stops reciprocating, leading to the friend feeling rejected.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual agreement. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. However, when the author starts a relationship, they stop, which is understandable. But after the breakup, resuming might have been okay at the time. The issue comes when the author tries to reciprocate but feels bad and stops. The friend might have felt used or rejected, even if the author was clear about his orientation. The friend's reaction is coldness, which is hurtful, but the author is now feeling guilty about ending the arrangement.\n\nThe other users said it's the author's fault for leading him on. But the author was clear he's straight and not interested in a relationship beyond the sexual aspect. However, the ongoing sexual arrangement, even if mutual, might have created emotional expectations on the friend's side. The author stopping suddenly could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if there was no romantic intent. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author may have ignored the emotional impact of ending the arrangement, even if it was mutual.\n\nBut the author tried to be honest and stop things politely. The friend's coldness is his own reaction. The author isn't in a relationship with the friend, so there's no obligation beyond the initial agreement. The main issue is whether the author's actions, while clear, caused harm without realizing the emotional stakes. The author might be in the right by being honest, but the friend's feelings are still valid. However, the author isn't the one violating the agreement; the friend might be projecting his own feelings. So, the answer could be B (No), but there's nuance. The key is whether the author acted in bad faith. Since he was honest and stopped when he felt uncomfortable, he's not in the wrong.\n"
