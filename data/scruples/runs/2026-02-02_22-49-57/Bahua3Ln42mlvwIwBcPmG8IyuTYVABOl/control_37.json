I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it when he started a relationship and later when the relationship ended. The friend became distant after the author stopped the activity. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't initiate the sexual activity. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. The author is clear about being straight and not having romantic feelings. They stopped the arrangement when they had a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. After feeling uncomfortable reciprocating, the author ended it again. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused about their responsibility.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't force anything; they accepted the offer but maintained boundaries. The issue arises when the author ended the arrangement, leading to the friend's cold behavior. The author is being asked if they're at fault for leading the friend on, but they didn't promise anything beyond what was clear\u2014no romantic involvement, just mutual sexual activity. \n\nThe friend's reaction might stem from unmet emotional expectations or feelings of rejection. However, the author communicated their boundaries, even when reciprocating. There's no indication of deceit. The problem here is more about the friend's emotional response rather than the author's actions. The author tried to maintain the friendship and even reached out, but the friend is withdrawing. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and ending the arrangement. The friend's hurt feelings are a result of their own expectations not being met, not the author's deceit. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
