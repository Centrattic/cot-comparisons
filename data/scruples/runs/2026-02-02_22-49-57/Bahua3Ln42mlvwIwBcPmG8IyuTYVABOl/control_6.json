I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then stopping when he got a girlfriend, and later when the girlfriend dumped him, resuming the activity but then deciding to stop again after he reciprocated once. The friend is now being cold and distant.\n\nFirst, the author is straight and heteroflexible, which means he's primarily attracted to women but might be open to some same-sex experiences. The friend is gay, so he might have had feelings or expectations beyond just a casual exchange. The initial arrangement was mutual, but when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. That seems okay because the author was in a relationship and likely didn't want to engage in anything that could be considered cheating or inappropriate.\n\nThen, when the girlfriend dumps him, they start again. The author is single now, so that's a different context. But then, after reciprocal action (sucking the friend), he feels bad and stops. So, the problem here is that the friend might have developed deeper feelings during their interactions, especially since the author was previously in a relationship. The friend might have hoped for more than just a one-time return favor, and when the author stops, it leaves the friend confused or hurt. \n\nThe author tried to explain it was about his identity, but maybe the friend felt used or that the relationship was transactional. The sub point where others said he led the friend on is valid because even if the author was clear about being straight, the friend might have still had hopes. The author's request for reciprocation once could have made the friend feel that the author wanted a balanced exchange, but then stopping might have been confusing. \n\nThe friend's reaction is being cold and distant, which is understandable if he felt rejected or that the author is only interested in the relationship when it's convenient. The author's confusion about why the friend is upset shows a lack of empathy for the friend's emotional needs. Even if the author is honest about being straight, the back-and-forth might have given the friend false hope. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how his actions and the subsequent withdrawal could affect his friend emotionally. The friend might have invested more into the relationship, and the author's abrupt changes in behavior could have damaged their friendship. The author should have been more communicative and maybe set clearer boundaries from the start to avoid leading the friend on, even unintentionally.\n"
