I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong in the situation they described. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend and later after a breakup. The friend became distant after the author tried reciprocal oral sex but felt bad and stopped. The author is confused because others say he led the friend on, but he claims he was clear about his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but isn't gay. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. They had a mutual agreement where the friend performed oral sex on the author. Then when the author was single again, they resumed, but when the author tried to reciprocate, he felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now the friend is upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants a second opinion. Let me break down the possible angles.\n\nFrom the start, the author didn't hide his sexual orientation. The friend is gay, so he might have had higher expectations or emotional investment. Even if the author was clear that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship, the ongoing sexual activity might have left the friend feeling used or unreciprocated. When the author tried to reciprocate, he felt bad and stopped, which could have been confusing for the friend. Maybe the friend felt rejected or that his affection wasn't returned, even if it was just physical.\n\nThe key issue here is consent and clear boundaries. If both parties agreed on the terms and understood the nature of their arrangement, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the friend developed feelings or expected more than a physical relationship, the author might have unknowingly led him on. The problem is that even if the author was upfront, the friend's perception might differ. The author changed his behavior after getting a girlfriend and then again after breaking up, which might have confused the friend about the consistency of their arrangement.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction being cold and distant could be due to feeling unappreciated or unreciprocated. The author tried to explain his feelings but maybe the friend felt hurt regardless. The author's attempt to maintain the friendship might be genuine, but the friend might need space or time to process. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, the author might not be in the wrong if he was honest about his intentions and the friend understood the boundaries. However, the author might have misjudged the friend's expectations, leading to hurt feelings. It's a gray area. The author's actions were consensual, but the emotional impact on the friend is significant. If the friend felt used or that the author wasn't treating him respectfully, then the author could be at fault. But if the friend misunderstood the arrangement, the author might not be entirely wrong.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer isn't clear-cut. The author might not be in the wrong if he was honest and consensual, but there are elements where he could have been more considerate of the friend's feelings. However, since the user is asking for a choice between A and B, I need to decide based on the information given. Since the author tried to be clear about his stance and their interactions were consensual, the answer might be B. But if the friend had expectations that the author didn't meet, then A. Hmm. Given the author's explanation that he was clear and the relationship was mutual, I'd lean towards B.\n"
