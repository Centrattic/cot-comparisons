I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves two 18-year-old males, one straight/heteroflexible and the other gay, engaging in a sexual arrangement. \n\nFirst, the friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resumed the activity. The author then felt bad, reciprocated with oral sex, and then decided to stop, explaining that he isn't into it. Now, the friend is distant, and the author is confused about being blamed for leading him on.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author didn't initially reciprocate, so the friend might have felt the relationship was one-sided. When the author finally reciprocated, even if it was uncomfortable, the friend might have felt a shift in the dynamic. Then the author stopped, which could have hurt the friend's feelings. The author tried to reach out but got minimal responses. The friend might feel betrayed when the author started reciprocating and then pulled back. \n\nAlso, the author's initial acceptance of the friend's advances might have led the friend to expect a certain level of mutual affection or commitment, even if it wasn't verbalized. The fact that the author later reciprocated, even briefly, could be seen as leading the friend on. The friend might feel used or that his affection wasn't respected. \n\nThe author argues that they were clear about being straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, actions can speak louder than words. The ongoing sexual arrangement without clear boundaries might have created confusion. The friend could see the author's actions as manipulative or inconsiderate, especially after the friend invested emotionally or physically.\n\nThe author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have been abrupt, causing the friend to feel rejected. The friend's coldness could be a reaction to feeling unappreciated or hurt. The author's attempts to reconnect might come off as insincere or dismissive if they don't acknowledge the friend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did set some boundaries initially, but the ongoing behavior might have created a situation where the friend felt entitled to more. The author's actions, especially the reciprocation followed by pulling away, could be seen as leading the friend on. Even if the author didn't intend to, the friend might have interpreted the actions differently. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might share some responsibility. They engaged in a sexual arrangement that led to emotional involvement, then changed their stance, causing hurt. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
