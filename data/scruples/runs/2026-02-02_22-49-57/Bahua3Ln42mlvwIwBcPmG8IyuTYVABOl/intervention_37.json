I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault based on the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible 18-year-old male. He had a gay friend who initiated oral sex, and he agreed. They continued this for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. Later, after the breakup, they resumed the activity until the author felt uncomfortable and stopped reciprocating. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused about whether he did something wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. Legally, in many places, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16 or 18, so since both are 18, that's likely not an issue. But the context is about morality and social expectations, not legality. \n\nThe key points are the nature of their relationship. The author mentions they are close friends, and the friend is gay. The author is straight, so the dynamic here is that the gay friend was performing oral sex on him. The author didn't reciprocate initially but did once, then stopped. The friend became upset and distant.\n\nThe author argues that there was no emotional attachment, no kissing, no commitment. He says he was clear about not being interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated, and the author didn't lead him on. However, others in a different sub said he led them on, which is the conflict.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, even if there's no romantic interest, engaging in sexual activities with a friend can create expectations or emotional dependencies. The friend might have felt that the sexual encounters implied some level of emotional connection or mutual interest beyond just physical. When the author stopped, it could be seen as a betrayal or rejection, hence the friend's coldness.\n\nThe author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been careless in terms of the friend's feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the friend might have developed feelings or expectations over time. The fact that the author reciprocated once (sucking him) and then immediately regretted it suggests that the friend might have taken that as a sign of mutual interest, which was then denied, causing hurt.\n\nAlso, the timing of resuming the activity after the breakup might have been problematic. The author's ex-girlfriend isn't mentioned as being involved, but the author's actions during the breakup period could be a factor. However, the author stopped once he got a girlfriend and resumed after the breakup, which seems more ethical in terms of fidelity.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author was respectful of the friend's feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to, the actions might have caused emotional harm. The friend's reaction indicates that he felt hurt, which the author might have overlooked. The author's attempts to reconcile (like the Christmas message) were met with minimal response, showing that the friend is still upset.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact on the friend, even if the sexual activity was consensual. The friend's feelings matter, and the author's decision to stop without addressing them properly could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while consensual, may have caused emotional harm to his friend without sufficient consideration of the friend's feelings.\n"
