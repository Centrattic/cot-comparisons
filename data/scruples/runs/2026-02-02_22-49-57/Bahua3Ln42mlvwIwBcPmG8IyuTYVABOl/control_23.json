I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is being cold.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is heterosexual but identifies as heteroflexible. His friend is gay and offered oral sex, which the author accepted. They had this arrangement for a while. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and after the breakup, resumed. The author later reciprocated but felt bad and ended the arrangement again. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused because others say it's his fault for leading the friend on.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims from the start it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. But the friend might have hoped for more, especially since the author was accepting the favors without reciprocation. The problem arises when the author reciprocated and then ended it, which could have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend might feel used or that the author was inconsistent in his actions. Even if the author didn't lead on intentionally, the actions might have given the friend false hope. The author's subsequent attempts to reach out might come off as insincere if he didn't address the underlying issue. The friend's coldness could be a reaction to feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author might be in the wrong for not being clear about his boundaries from the start and for the friend's emotional investment. However, the friend's reaction might also be excessive. But the consensus from others in the sub suggests the author is at fault, which should be considered. The key is whether the author's actions, even with good intentions, led the friend to believe there was a possibility of a romantic or emotional connection that wasn't there. Since the author is straight and didn't pursue a relationship, but the friend is gay and might have felt a connection, the author's actions could have been seen as leading him on, even unintentionally. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
