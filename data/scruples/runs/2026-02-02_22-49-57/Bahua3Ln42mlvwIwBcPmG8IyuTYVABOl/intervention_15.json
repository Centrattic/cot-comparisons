I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started this when he was single and then stopped when he had a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but then he felt bad and stopped again, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others said he led the friend on, but he insists it was clear he wasn't interested romantically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. They both agreed to the arrangement from the start, so there's no coercion. The author was honest about his orientation, so maybe the friend still had expectations beyond just the sexual acts. When the author ended the arrangement, the friend felt hurt, which might be because he developed feelings over time. The author might not have realized that the friend's emotional investment grew, even if it was just a sexual relationship. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author did communicate his orientation and the nature of their interactions. However, the friend might have felt that the relationship had become more significant to him, especially after the author stopped reciprocating. The act of the author performing oral on the friend might have been a turning point, leading to confusion or increased feelings on the friend's part. The author then ended it, which the friend took as a rejection. \n\nIt's possible that the author didn't consider how the friend might emotionally interpret their actions over time. Even if the author was clear about his lack of romantic interest, the friend's feelings could have evolved. The author's actions might have led to emotional harm, even if unintentionally. The fact that the friend is now distant suggests that the author's decision to stop caused hurt, which the author didn't foresee or address properly. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to lead the friend on, the ongoing sexual relationship might have created unspoken expectations. The author's decision to end it without considering the emotional impact could make him partly responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't fully acknowledge the friend's potential emotional needs or the consequences of ending the arrangement.\n"
