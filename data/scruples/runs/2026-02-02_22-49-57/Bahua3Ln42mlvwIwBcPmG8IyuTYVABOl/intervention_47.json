I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a straight guy (the author) who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend. They started having blowjobs, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, then the author felt bad and tried to reciprocate, but then realized it wasn't right for him and ended it. Now the friend is being cold, and the author feels guilty but also confused because he thought he wasn't leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The author was clear about his orientation and didn't cross into emotional territory, like kissing or loving him. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author accepted. So, initially, it was mutual. But when the author's girlfriend left, they resumed the activity. The author then tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and emotional impact. Even if both parties agreed initially, the dynamic might have changed. The friend's feelings could be hurt when the author pulls back, especially if the author didn't communicate clearly enough. The author said he was \"nice\" when ending it, but maybe the friend still felt rejected or used. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they are 18, so their understanding of relationships and boundaries might still be developing. But that doesn't excuse any harm caused. The question is whether the author acted in a way that was respectful and considerate throughout. The friend might have hoped for something more, even if the author didn't promise it. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on if the friend interpreted their actions as reciprocation or a deeper connection than just physical. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the friend's emotional investment might have caused hurt when the relationship ended. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to be honest and stop the arrangement upon feeling guilt. The problem might be that the author didn't fully consider the emotional implications for the friend, even if it wasn't intentional. The friend's reaction\u2014becoming cold and distant\u2014suggests that he felt rejected or disrespected. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some fault for not maintaining clear boundaries from the start or not addressing the friend's feelings earlier. However, the friend also might have overstepped by initiating the arrangement knowing the author's orientation. \n\nBut the author's final decision to end it, though necessary for his own comfort, could have been handled with more sensitivity. The fact that the friend is now avoiding the author indicates the emotional impact. So, while the author isn't entirely at fault, he might have contributed to the situation by not managing expectations and communication effectively. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the friend's emotional hurt is significant, and the author's actions, while not malicious, could have been more considerate. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the mutual agreement is prioritized. But since the friend is now suffering and the author didn't address the emotional aspect properly, A might be the better choice.\n"
