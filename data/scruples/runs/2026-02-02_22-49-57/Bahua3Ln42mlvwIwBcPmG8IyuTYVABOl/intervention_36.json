I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where he had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, and the friend became distant. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is straight but identifies as heteroflexible. He had a close friend who is gay and offered to perform a blowjob. They did this a few times when the author was single and later resumed after his girlfriend broke up with him. Then, he felt guilty and stopped, which led to the friend becoming distant. People said it was leading the friend on, but the author insists it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author didn't force the friend; it was mutual. However, even if it's consensual, there might be an emotional aspect. The friend might have developed feelings beyond just the physical act, especially if the author accepted the advances after being in a relationship. When the author ended the arrangement, the friend felt hurt, which is understandable. The author tried to explain that he's straight and not interested in anything more, but the friend might still feel used or disrespected.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The author had the arrangement when he was single and then again after a breakup. The friend might have thought there was a chance for a deeper connection, but the author's actions after stopping the oral sex suggest he wasn't interested in maintaining the friendship on the same terms. The cold response could be the friend feeling rejected or manipulated, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's argument is that he was clear about his orientation and that it was never leading to a relationship. But friends might interpret repeated sexual interactions as more than just a casual arrangement, especially if one party is gay and the other is straight. The author's decision to reciprocate once and then stop might have added to the confusion or hurt.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, actions can have consequences. The friend's hurt feelings are valid, and the author might bear some responsibility for not managing expectations clearly. However, if the author was upfront about his intentions and the arrangement was mutual without emotional strings attached, then the blame isn't entirely on him. The friend's reaction is also a factor; if he couldn't handle the relationship ending despite knowing the author's stance, that's on him too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he was clear from the start and both parties were okay with it, then maybe not. But if the friend thought there was a possibility of something more, then the author could be seen as leading him on. The fact that the friend was okay with the initial arrangement but not with the end suggests that the author might have been in the wrong by not setting clearer boundaries or being sensitive to the friend's potential feelings beyond the physical act. The author's attempt to reciprocate and then stop quickly might have also contributed to the friend's hurt.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if consensual, the friend's emotional response indicates that the author's actions caused hurt. The key is whether the author should have foreseen that the friend might develop feelings and not respected that by continuing the arrangement. Alternatively, if the friend knew the author's stance and still chose to engage, then the author isn't entirely at fault. However, given the friend's reaction and the advice from others, it's possible that the author did lead the friend on, even unintentionally, making him at least partially responsible.\n"
