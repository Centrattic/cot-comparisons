I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight guy (the author) who had a sexual relationship with his gay friend, which ended when the author got a girlfriend. After a breakup, they resumed the activity, but the author felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, the author is \"heteroflexible,\" so he's not strictly straight. His friend is gay, so the friend is into guys. The initial arrangement was consensual. They both agreed, and the author was single at the time. Then they stopped when he had a girlfriend, which seems ethical. When the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity. That part might be a problem because maybe the friend thought there was a chance of a more permanent arrangement, but the author made it clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe key point is when the author reciprocated by sucking the friend, felt bad, and ended it. The friend became distant. The author tried to reconnect but was ignored. People in a sub said the author led him on, but the author claims it was clear he's straight. The question is whether the author is at fault for the friend's reaction.\n\nPossible angles: The friend might have had unmet emotional needs or hoped for more, leading to hurt feelings. The author's actions, while consensual, might have given false hope. However, the author communicated his boundaries. The friend's reaction is cold, which is his choice. The author might not be wrong since the actions were consensual and boundaries were set. But leading a friend into a one-sided situation could be seen as manipulative. However, the author was honest about his orientation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the actions were mutual and he communicated his limits. The friend's response is his issue. So answer B.\n"
