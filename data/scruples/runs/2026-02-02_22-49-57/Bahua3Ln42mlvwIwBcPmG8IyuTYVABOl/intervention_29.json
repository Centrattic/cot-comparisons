I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The scenario involves a straight/heteroflexible guy and a gay friend engaging in oral sex, then the author ends the arrangement after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. The friend becomes distant, leading the author to question his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that he's heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex encounters but isn't primarily attracted that way. The friend is gay, so there's an imbalance in the sexual arrangement\u2014always the friend giving oral sex, then the author reciprocates once but feels bad and stops. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the author lead the friend on? The author claims it was clear he's not into a relationship or affection, just physical interaction. But the friend might have developed feelings over time, especially since the author was a close friend. Engaging in sexual acts can create emotional attachment, even if one person isn't intending it. \n\nWhen the author reciprocated and then stopped, the friend felt hurt. The author says he was clear about his orientation, but maybe the friend saw hope for more. The author's decision to end the arrangement might have been abrupt, leading to the friend's withdrawal. \n\nAlso, the author's actions after breaking up with his girlfriend\u2014resuming the arrangement\u2014could be seen as using the friend for physical needs despite knowing the friend's feelings. The friend might have felt used, especially after the author stopped reciprocating and ended it.\n\nThe author's communication might have been clear, but actions can still hurt. The friend's cold response suggests he felt rejected or disrespected. The author's attempt to reach out and organize meetings was ignored, indicating ongoing hurt. \n\nIn terms of ethics, consent was present initially, but the ongoing dynamic might have crossed into emotional territory the author didn't consider. Even if physical, it's about mutual respect. Stopping without considering the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author had his own reasons.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended to lead on, the impact on the friend matters. The author's actions might have been selfish in the long run, not considering the emotional toll. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not maintaining open communication and respecting the friend's emotional state throughout.\n"
