I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a friend offer him a blowjob, and they engaged in this multiple times. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after a breakup, resumed. The author later felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to the friend getting distant. The community says it's the author's fault, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The author mentions it was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. So there's no indication that the friend thought there was a chance for more. The acts were consensual and agreed upon both sides. \n\nBut then, when the author later reciprocated, he felt bad and stopped. That might have caused the friend to feel rejected or used. Even though the author was honest about his orientation, the ongoing back-and-forth could have led to emotional attachment or unmet expectations on the friend's side. \n\nThe friend's reaction being cold and distant after the author stopped might suggest that the friend had deeper feelings or hoped for more from the relationship. The author might not have been aware of those feelings, but the act of stopping after reciprocating could have been hurtful. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others say it's his fault. The key points here are consent, communication, and emotional impact. The author did communicate his boundaries, but the ongoing nature of the arrangement might have created confusion. Even if it's consensual, the friend might have felt the relationship was one-sided or that his affection wasn't reciprocated. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as leading the friend on by continuing the arrangement after getting a girlfriend and then breaking up. However, the author did stop when he felt uncomfortable. The friend's reaction is more about unmet emotional needs rather than a clear violation of consent. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The author might not be in the wrong because there was consent and clear boundaries. However, the emotional impact on the friend is significant, and the author might have not considered the deeper feelings the friend had. So, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nBut according to the community's response and the standard of \"Am I the Asshole,\" if the actions caused harm despite the initial consent, the author might be seen as the asshole. The friend's hurt feelings are valid, even if the author didn't intend to. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the actions led to emotional harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
