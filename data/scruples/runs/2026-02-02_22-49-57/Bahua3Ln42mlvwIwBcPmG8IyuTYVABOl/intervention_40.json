I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author, a straight heteroflexible male, has a gay friend who offered him a blowjob. They engaged in this several times, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the relationship ended, they resumed, but the author later felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both were adults, 18 years old, and the acts were consensual. The author was upfront about his sexual orientation, so there's no indication of deception. The issue arises when the author stops the arrangement, making the friend feel led on. The friend's reaction is to become cold and distant. The author tried to explain and apologize, but the friend isn't responding well. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others in the sub said it's his fault for leading on. But leading on implies deception or false hopes. The author made it clear he's not interested romantically or sexually beyond oral sex. However, the friend might have hoped for a deeper relationship or felt used. The author stopping the arrangement could have hurt the friend's feelings, even if it was clear there was no romantic intent.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is gay and the author is straight might affect the dynamics. The friend might have felt a connection or had unspoken expectations. The author's actions, while consensual, could have been emotionally hurtful. The key points are consent, mutual understanding, and subsequent emotional impact. The author isn't in the wrong legally or ethically for stopping a consensual act, but socially, there might be a breach of trust or emotional harm. However, the user's question is about being in the wrong, which usually relates to wrongdoing. Since everything was consensual and the author tried to be clear, the answer might be B. But if the author's actions caused emotional harm despite clarity, maybe A. Need to weigh consent against emotional impact.\n"
