I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend offering blowjobs, then canceling after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual, heteroflexible male. He had a close friend who is gay and offered oral sex. He accepted, which continued for a while. Then he got a girlfriend and they stopped. After the breakup with the girlfriend, the activity resumed. Later, the author felt guilty and reciprocated, which made him uncomfortable, so he ended it. The friend became distant, and the author is now questioning if he's wrong.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. Initially, both parties seemed to agree to the arrangement. The author was clear about his sexuality, and the friend was aware that the author wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. However, when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and ended the arrangement. The friend's reaction of being cold and distant is a problem, but the author's actions might have caused hurt feelings.\n\nThe author's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as leading the friend on if the friend developed emotional attachment or expected a different outcome. The author didn't address the friend's feelings directly, which might have exacerbated the situation. However, the author was honest about his intentions and ended things when he felt uncomfortable. The friend's response is uncharacteristic and possibly a reflection of his own issues.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might share some responsibility. The author could have communicated more clearly when ending the arrangement, but the friend also might have needed to set boundaries. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether leading on or not addressing the friend's feelings counts as being in the wrong. Given the initial mutual agreement and the author's honesty about his sexuality, it's not entirely his fault. However, the act of reciprocating and then stopping might have caused confusion. The friend's reaction is more of an issue, but the AITA context often looks at who's at fault in the conflict. Considering all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
