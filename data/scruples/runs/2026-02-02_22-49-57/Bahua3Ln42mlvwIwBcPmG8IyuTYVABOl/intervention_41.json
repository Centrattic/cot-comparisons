I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They did this a few times over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. The girlfriend dumped him, so they started again. The author then reciprocated once but felt bad and said they should stop. After that, the friend became distant. The author tried to reach out, but the friend was unresponsive. Others said the author led him on, but the author claims it was clear they were straight and there was no expectation of a romantic relationship.\n\nHmm. The author's actions involve engaging in a sexual act with a friend who is gay. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't force the friend; the friend offered, and the author accepted. However, the author later changed their mind and ended the arrangement. The friend is now upset and distant.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend is gay, so he's likely seeking more than just a one-time sexual encounter. The author might have given the friend false hope or led him on by engaging in this behavior repeatedly, even after getting a girlfriend and then breaking up. Even though the author claims they were clear about being straight, the friend might have interpreted the ongoing sexual interactions as a deeper connection or as a sign of reciprocation of feelings, which the author didn't have. The author's decision to reciprocate once and then stop might have confused the friend further, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nBut the author did try to communicate that they weren't interested in a romantic or more committed relationship. However, the friend might still feel used or that the author took advantage of his affection. The author's actions could be seen as emotionally manipulative, even if unintentionally. The friend's response\u2014becoming distant\u2014suggests that he felt rejected or hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't hide their orientation and made it clear they weren't interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated the sexual encounters, so there's a question of mutual consent. However, the ongoing nature of the relationship might have blurred lines, leading the friend to expect more than the author intended.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for not setting clearer boundaries from the start. Even if they were honest about their orientation, engaging in repeated sexual acts could be seen as leading the friend on, regardless of the author's intentions. The friend's feelings are valid, but the author might not be entirely at fault if they were upfront. However, the act of reciprocating once might have given the friend a false sense of mutual interest, complicating things further.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author actively led the friend on, creating false expectations. If the author was clear about being straight and not interested in a relationship, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the actions (repeated sexual encounters) gave the friend the impression of a deeper connection, the author might bear some responsibility. The friend's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he's taking it personally and needs time to process. The author tried to reach out, which shows they care about the friendship, but the friend's coldness is a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong, there's a shared responsibility here. The author could have been more proactive in setting boundaries from the start to prevent misunderstandings. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, even if consensual, led to hurt feelings and a damaged friendship, which they should have anticipated and prevented by being clearer about their intentions.\n"
