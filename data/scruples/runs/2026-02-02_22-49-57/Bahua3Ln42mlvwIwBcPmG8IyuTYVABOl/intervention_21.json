I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a straight man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, causing the friend to become distant. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding.\n\nFirst, the initial arrangement: the friend offered, and the author accepted. Both were adults (18), so legally there's no issue. The author mentions being clear about being straight and not having romantic feelings. That seems important because it sets boundaries early on. \n\nThen, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and the friend was okay with it. But after the breakup, they resumed. The author later reciprocated but felt bad and ended it, explaining it wasn't their thing. The friend's reaction was coldness and distance. The author is confused because they thought they were upfront about their feelings and boundaries.\n\nThe main questions here are about respect for the friend's feelings and whether the author's actions led to hurt. Even though they were upfront, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship, even if one-sided, can create emotional expectations. The author might have inadvertently made the friend feel used or unappreciated, even if they were clear about not wanting a romantic relationship. \n\nThe author's actions after reciprocating once and then stopping might have left the friend feeling rejected or confused. The friend's withdrawal is a reaction to that rejection. The author tried to communicate their position, but maybe not in a way that addressed the emotional impact. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author respected the friend's emotional needs. Even if they were clear about their own limits, they might not have considered how their actions affected the friend's feelings. Ending the arrangement was right, but the aftermath shows that the friend was emotionally invested. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the emotional consequences or not providing enough support when ending the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle the emotional fallout properly, even if their intentions were clear.\n"
