I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a male friend who identified as gay offering and performing blowjobs on the author, who is straight but heteroflexible. They had this arrangement for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend, but resumed after the breakup. The author then felt bad after reciprocating and ended the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is straight, but the friend is gay. The author is heteroflexible, which I think means they're open to some same-sex encounters but not necessarily in a romantic context. The friend offered Blowjob, and the author agreed. They stopped when the author had a girlfriend, which makes sense if they were trying to maintain the relationship. Then when the girlfriend dumps him, they start again. \n\nThe author then, after a few weeks, reciprocates by sucking the friend but immediately feels awful and tells him they can't continue. The friend becomes cold and distant. The author tried to reach out, but the friend is not responding as before. The author is confused because they didn't think they were leading the friend on, as they were clear about their straightness. Others have said it's their fault for leading on the friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Mutual Consent**: The initial encounters were consensual. Both parties agreed to the arrangement. The author was clear about their orientation, so there's no deception here.\n\n2. **Ending the Relationship**: When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped the arrangement. That seems responsible, as they were in a committed relationship. After the breakup, they resumed, which might be where things get more complicated. But again, if both agreed, then mutual consent exists.\n\n3. **Reciprocation and Ending the Arrangement**: The author tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and stopped the arrangement. The friend might have felt rejected or humiliated, leading to the cold response. However, the author acted in good faith, trying to be honest about their feelings and boundaries.\n\n4. **Friendship Dynamics**: The friend's behavior after the arrangement ended is problematic. Becoming distant and unresponsive could be a reaction to the rejection, but it's also possible the author should have anticipated this and managed the situation differently. However, the author tried to reach out and explain, showing they care about the friendship.\n\n5. **Friend's Perspective**: The friend might have felt that the physical relationship was a form of emotional connection. When the author ended it, the friend might have felt abandoned or unappreciated. The author's decision to stop could be seen as a betrayal from the friend's viewpoint, even if the author was clear about their orientation.\n\nNow, considering ethical aspects. The author wasn't deceptive; they were honest about being straight. The encounters were consensual. The issue arises when the author ends the arrangement, which might cause emotional harm. However, the author's responsibility isn't to maintain the friendship at the cost of their own comfort or honesty. They have the right to set boundaries, even if it affects the relationship.\n\nOthers in the sub said the author led the friend on, but if there was no romantic or emotional deception, just a physical arrangement with clear boundaries, then leading on might not apply here. The author was upfront about their orientation and the nature of the relationship.\n\nThe friend's reaction is more about feeling rejected, which is a valid emotional response, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author's actions were honest and respectful in stopping the arrangement once they felt uncomfortable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complex and both parties might have valid feelings, the author acted within their rights to be honest and set boundaries. The friend's cold behavior is more about his reaction to the rejection rather than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
