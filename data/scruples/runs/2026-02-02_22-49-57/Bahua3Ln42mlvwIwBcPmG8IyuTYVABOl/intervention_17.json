I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and they engaged in this for a while. Then the user got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the user tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended things. His friend became distant and unresponsive.\n\nThe main question is whether the user is at fault. The user is confused because others said he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. \n\nFirst, the user was honest about his orientation. The friend initiated the sexual activity, so the user wasn't necessarily taking advantage. However, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, even if consensual, can create emotional complications. When the user ended it, the friend's reaction suggests hurt feelings, possibly due to unexpressed emotional attachment. The user might not be in the wrong for stopping the arrangement, especially if it made him uncomfortable. But there's a possibility that the friend had deeper feelings, which the user didn't consider. The user's actions might have been a betrayal of trust or caused emotional harm, even unintentionally. Since both are 18, maturity levels might affect how they handle situations. The key points are consent, communication, and the aftermath. If the user was clear about his intentions all along, he might not be at fault. However, the friend's distress indicates that the user's actions had a negative impact, even if unintentional. So, while the user isn't necessarily the sole wrongdoer, there might be shared responsibility in not managing the friend's emotions adequately.\n"
