I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then things changed, and now they're not talking. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is heterosexual but identifies as heteroflexible. He had a close friend who's gay and offered to provide oral sex, which he accepted multiple times. When the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, and when the relationship ended, they resumed. The author then tried to reciprocate, felt uncomfortable, and ended the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant. Others say the author led the friend on, but the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic or emotional relationship.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author's actions were deceitful or exploitative. The author was upfront about his sexuality and intentions, so maybe there's no deception. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author didn't seek a deeper relationship. However, the act of having a sexual relationship, even with mutual consent, might have created emotional expectations that weren't met when the author ended it. \n\nThe author tried to reciprocate, which shows some consideration, but then stopped because it made him uncomfortable. The friend's reaction could be due to hurt feelings or unmet emotional needs, even if not expressed as such. The question is whether the author had a responsibility to consider the friend's emotional state beyond just the sexual arrangement. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties consented and the boundaries were clear, the author might not be at fault. But if the friend had unspoken expectations of a deeper connection, the author could be seen as leading him on, even unintentionally. However, the author did end the arrangement when he felt it was necessary and communicated it politely. \n\nThe key points are consent, clarity of boundaries, and emotional impact. The author might not be in the wrong if the boundaries were clear and respected. But the friend's reaction suggests there was emotional harm, which the author might have overlooked. However, the author tried to maintain the friendship afterward and faced rejection. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might depend on cultural or social norms, but legally and ethically, if consensual and clear, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But the friend's hurt feelings are valid, and the author's actions might have unintentionally caused harm. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and based on the information, I'd lean towards that. The answer would be B (No).\n"
