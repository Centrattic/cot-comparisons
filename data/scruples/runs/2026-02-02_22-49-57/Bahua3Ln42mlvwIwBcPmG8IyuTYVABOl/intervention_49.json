I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single, stopped when he had a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The author felt bad about the dynamic and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was clear from the start that he's not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship, just physical interactions. The friend initiated the sexual acts, and the author agreed without any promises. When the author ended it, the friend became cold. The question is whether the author is at fault for leading the friend on or not.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't make any false promises. The friend might have developed feelings, but the author was upfront about his orientation. However, the act of engaging in sexual activity, even if consensual, can be seen as leading someone on if there's an expectation of reciprocity or emotional connection. The author's decision to stop and communicate it nicely might not have been enough if the friend felt used or hurt.\n\nBut legally and in terms of consent, as long as both parties agreed and there were no non-verbal promises of exclusivity or emotional commitment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the social and emotional impact matters. Even if there's no legal wrongdoing, the author's actions might have caused emotional distress, which makes him morally responsible to some extent.\n\nThe friends were close before the sexual relationship, and the author's actions might have altered the dynamic irreparably. The friend's reaction suggests he felt rejected or humiliated, which the author may not have anticipated. The author's responsibility includes considering the emotional well-being of the friend, even if the initial agreement was consensual.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be legally wrong, there's a moral aspect to consider. The friend's hurt feelings could be seen as a result of the author not fully anticipating the emotional consequences. However, if the author was clear and consensual, it's debatable. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author communicated his boundaries and the issue lies more with the friend's unmet expectations.\n"
