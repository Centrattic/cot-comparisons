I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, the author is a straight but heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They started a mutual sexual arrangement where the friend gave blowjobs. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author later reciprocated, felt bad, and decided to stop. Now the friend is being cold and distant, leading the author to question if they're at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement. The author was clear about not being in a romantic relationship with the friend. When the author reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable and ended it, which might have been sudden for the friend. The friend's reaction is hurt, possibly feeling rejected or used. \n\nThe author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was a romantic or deeper connection than there was. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the physical intimacy could create emotional attachment. The friend might feel that the author took advantage of his affection. The author's sudden change in behavior after reciprocating could have been hurtful, even if it was done kindly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author didn't force anything, but the ongoing arrangement might have created expectations the author didn't meet. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author's decision to stop reciprocation might have been necessary but handled in a way that didn't consider the friend's emotional state. So, there's room to argue the author could have managed the situation more sensitively, leading to the friend feeling rejected. Therefore, the author might have some responsibility here.\n"
