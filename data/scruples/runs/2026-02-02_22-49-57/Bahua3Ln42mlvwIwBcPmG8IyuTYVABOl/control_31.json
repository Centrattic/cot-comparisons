I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's start by looking at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted, leading to a few instances of this over the weeks. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. The author later reciprocated but felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is being cold, and the author is confused about whether they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that they were clear about their orientation and didn't lead the friend on. However, the friend might have had feelings or expectations that weren't communicated. The author's actions could be seen as using the friend for sexual favors without emotional reciprocity, which might have led to hurt feelings when the author stopped. Even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the friend might have developed emotional attachments or felt used. \n\nThe author's actions might have been a betrayal of trust or friendship, even if it was consensual. The fact that they resumed after the breakup and then stopped, causing the friend to become distant, suggests that the friend felt the connection was more meaningful than just physical. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend, especially since the friend is gay and might have had deeper feelings. \n\nIn terms of friendship, maintaining trust and mutual respect is crucial. If the author's actions made the friend feel like they were being used or led on, even unintentionally, then the author could be at fault. The friend's coldness might be a reaction to feeling disrespected or unappreciated. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions could have caused emotional harm to the friend, even if there was no explicit romantic intent. The key here is the friend's perspective and the impact of the author's actions on the relationship.\n"
