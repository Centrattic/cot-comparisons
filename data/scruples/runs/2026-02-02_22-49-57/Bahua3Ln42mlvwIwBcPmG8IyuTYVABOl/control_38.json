I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. The friend became distant, leading the author to question his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author clarifies he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend is gay, which the author knew from the start. They had a mutual agreement for oral sex, which stopped when the author was in a relationship. After the breakup, they resumed the activity, but the author felt uncomfortable when reciprocating and ended it. Now, the friend is distant, and others say the author led him on.\n\nThe main ethical questions here are consent, clear boundaries, and the impact on the friendship. Since both parties were adults (18) and the arrangement was consensual, there's no indication of non-consensual acts. The author did set boundaries by clarifying he's straight and not interested in a relationship. However, when the author later reciprocated and then ended the arrangement, it might have left the friend feeling humiliated or rejected, leading to the cold response. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as inconsistent if the friend felt that the reciprocation implied a shift in the dynamic. Even though the author tried to explain it wasn't his thing, the friend's reaction suggests hurt feelings. Others' opinions that the author led him on might stem from the ongoing arrangement despite the lack of mutual romantic interest. However, the author didn't explicitly promise anything beyond the physical act. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong since the acts were consensual and boundaries were set. But the abrupt end after reciprocation could have caused emotional distress. However, the friend's reaction seems extreme, and the author isn't obligated to maintain the relationship if it's causing him discomfort. The key is whether the author acted with clear communication and respect. Since he did communicate his limits and ended it without deceit, the fault may not be entirely his. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe the ongoing arrangement without a clear mutual understanding of the terms led to confusion. However, the author's actions were honest, so I'll stick with B.\n"
