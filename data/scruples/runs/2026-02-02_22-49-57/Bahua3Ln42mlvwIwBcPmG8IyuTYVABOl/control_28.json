I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a friend, who is gay, offer him a blowjob. They had this arrangement for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the girlfriend left, they resumed, but when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and ended it. Now, the friend is being cold, and the author is questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are consent, honesty, and how the actions affect their friendship. The author was clear about his orientation and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, engaging in sexual activities with a friend, even if consensual, can complicate the friendship. The friend might have had emotional attachments or expectations that were unmet. \n\nWhen the author reciprocated, he felt sick and ended it, which shows he was uncomfortable. The friend's response of becoming distant suggests he felt rejected or hurt. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was a mutual emotional connection beyond just physical acts. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the friend might have interpreted the relationship as more than just physical. \n\nThe author might have a responsibility to consider how his actions affect his friend's feelings, even if he's not romantically interested. The friend's coldness could be due to feeling used or unappreciated, especially if he invested emotionally or physically in the arrangement. The author's decision to end it abruptly after reciprocation might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the current tension.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and relationships, friends engaging in sexual acts can blur boundaries. The author's initial acceptance and then sudden withdrawal could be seen as inconsistent, leading to confusion and hurt. While the author claims he was clear about his orientation, actions can sometimes send mixed signals. The friend might have hoped for more, even if the author didn't. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions, while perhaps consensual, might have caused emotional harm to the friend. The author's responsibility includes being mindful of the friend's feelings and maintaining clear communication. The friend's reaction indicates that the author's behavior was hurtful, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact on his friend and for not maintaining clear boundaries.\n"
