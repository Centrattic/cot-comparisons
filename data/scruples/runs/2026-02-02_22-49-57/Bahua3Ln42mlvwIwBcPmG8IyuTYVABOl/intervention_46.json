I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author agreed. They continued this for a while.\n2. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed.\n3. The author tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and stopped things again.\n4. The friend became distant, and the author feels confused because they thought they were clear about their intentions.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're to blame. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, consent is present here; both parties agreed. The author was honest about their orientation and didn't lead the friend to believe there was a romantic relationship. However, the issue might be about emotional boundaries. Even if it's consensual, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used, especially when the author reciprocated but then pulled back. The author might have unintentionally hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the coldness. But the author tried to communicate clearly and stopped things when it made them uncomfortable. There's no indication of deceit. The friend's reaction is more about their own emotions rather than the author acting wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to consider if there's an ethical issue beyond just honesty. Since the author was upfront and the issue is more about the friend's feelings, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
