I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then things changed when he got a girlfriend, and later after the breakup. Now the friend is being cold and distant. The author feels bad and is confused if he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is heteroflexible, so maybe that's a factor. He had a friend who he's close to, a gay friend, and they started with Blowjob arrangements. The author was single and then got a girlfriend, so they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt uncomfortable when reciprocating and ended it. Now the friend is distant.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is not, but wants to see my perspective. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me consider the ethical aspects here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he was clear about his orientation and didn't lead the friend to believe there was a romantic or emotional commitment. He ended the arrangement when he felt uncomfortable, and the friend is now being distant. The friend might feel used or rejected, especially since he's gay and might have had deeper feelings. However, the author didn't promise anything beyond the physical acts. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't consider the emotional impact on the friend. Even if he was clear about his preferences, the act of continuing the arrangement after the breakup might have given the friend hope or expectations that weren't reciprocated. When the author ended it, it could have been hurtful, even if done kindly. The friend's reaction suggests he felt rejected or disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to communicate clearly and ended it without being mean. He might not have intended to hurt the friend. The issue is whether his actions, even if well-intentioned, caused harm. The friends' closeness before and after the situation complicates things. The author is now struggling with losing a friend but feeling he's not at fault.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong if he was honest about his intentions and ended things respectfully. However, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to acknowledge that even if he's not \"in the wrong,\" his actions had consequences. But the question is whether he is in the wrong, not just if he could have done better.\n\nConsidering that, the answer might be B (No), because the author was clear about his orientation, didn't lead the friend on, and ended things respectfully. The friend's hurt feelings are a result of his own hopes, which the author didn't foster. However, there's a nuanced aspect where emotional harm can occur regardless of intent. But according to the scenario as presented, the author didn't act maliciously. So I think the answer is B.\n"
