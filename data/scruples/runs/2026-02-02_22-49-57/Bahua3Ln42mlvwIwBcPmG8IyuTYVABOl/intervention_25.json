I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it, and now the friend is being distant. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the author is described as a heteroflexible man. He's in a good friendship with a gay guy who offered a blowjob. The author accepted because he was single and horny. Then they continued this for a while. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and the friend was okay with that. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author then felt bad and reciprocated, but felt awful and stopped it, explaining it wasn't what he is. Now the friend is cold, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was open about being straight, the friend initiated the sexual acts, the arrangement was mutual and consensual, and the author ended it after feeling uncomfortable with reciprocal actions. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider the ethics and social norms. The author didn't lead the friend on; he was upfront about his orientation. The friend was the one offering and initiating, which the author accepted. When the author ended it, he did so politely and clearly. The friend's reaction is now the issue. The author's actions were within his boundaries, even if the friend is upset. The friend might be upset because of unmet expectations or possible unspoken feelings, but the author didn't cross any lines. The author was honest and ended it respectfully. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's coldness is his own problem, not the author's fault."
