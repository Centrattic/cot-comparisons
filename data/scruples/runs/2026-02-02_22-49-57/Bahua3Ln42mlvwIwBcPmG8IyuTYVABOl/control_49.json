I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend, resumed after the breakup, and then stopped again when he felt uncomfortable. Now the friend is cold and distant.\n\nFirst, the author is clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The initial arrangement was mutual, with the friend offering and the author accepting. Then they stopped when he had a girlfriend, which seems respectful because he was in a relationship. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement but then the author decided to stop again after reciprocating, which made him uncomfortable. He communicated this to his friend in a nice way.\n\nThe friend is now distant, and others have judged the author for leading the friend on. The question is whether the author is wrong. Considering that the author was honest about his orientation, didn't pursue a romantic relationship, and communicated his discomfort when he felt it, it seems like he tried to be respectful. However, there's an issue with the ongoing friendship and the emotional impact on the friend. The author might have not considered the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement, even if he was clear about his stance. Ending a sexual relationship can be hurtful regardless of the circumstances, especially if one person is more emotionally invested. The author's actions might have caused emotional distress to his friend, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if there was no deceit. So, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of his honesty, he might have been inconsiderate of his friend's feelings, making him responsible for the fallout.\n"
