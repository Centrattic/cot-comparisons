I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight male and his gay friend engaging in sexual activities, then the friend feeling uncomfortable and ending it, leading to a strained friendship.\n\nFirst, the author is a self-identified straight, heteroflexible guy. His gay friend offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then immediately regretted it and told his friend they should stop. Since then, the friend has become distant and unresponsive to the author's attempts to reconnect.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship. The author didn't misrepresent his feelings; he was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated the sexual arrangement, and the author participated knowing the friend is gay. However, when the author reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable and ended it, which might have hurt the friend's feelings.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's actions were leading the friend on. The author didn't engage in a romantic relationship, just sexual acts without emotional commitment. The friend might have felt that the author was using him or that the situation was one-sided, especially since the author didn't reciprocate in a way that the friend expected. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have been abrupt, causing emotional distress.\n\nThe friend's reaction of becoming distant could be due to feeling used or unappreciated. Even if the author was clear about his boundaries, the friend might have developed feelings or felt that the arrangement was unfair. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have led to hurt feelings because the dynamic changed when he reciprocated and then stopped. The author's attempts to reconnect might not be enough if the friend feels betrayed or unvalued. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for not addressing the friend's potential emotional needs or for not being more considerate when ending the arrangement. However, the friend also has a role in managing his own expectations and boundaries. The author was honest about his orientation and didn't lead the friend on in a romantic sense. The conflict arises from differing expectations about the nature of the relationship and mutual respect for boundaries.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but his actions might have caused unintended harm. The friend's reaction is also important to consider, but the author's intention wasn't to manipulate. The main issue is whether the author's actions crossed a line by participating in a one-sided arrangement and then stopping, leading to the friend's distress. Given that the author communicated his boundaries and didn't engage in deception, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to take responsibility for communication.\n"
