I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight-identified male who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author accepted a blowjob from his friend. The friend is gay, so maybe he's into this because he's into men. The author is heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to same-sex encounters but not necessarily attracted to men. The key point here is consent. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. Then, after the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which makes sense. But when the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. \n\nThen, the author tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and stopped the arrangement. The friend became cold. The author tried to reconnect but was met with minimal responses. The author feels confused because they didn't lead the friend on, but others say they did. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about consent and boundaries. The author and friend had a mutual understanding. The author was clear about his orientation. When the author ended the arrangement, it's possible the friend felt rejected or used. But the author tried to end it politely. \n\nHowever, the act of having a sexual relationship with a friend of the same sex, even if consensual, can be problematic in certain contexts. The fact that the author is straight and the friend is gay might mean the friend had a crush or deeper feelings. The author's actions might have caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe author ending the arrangement after reciprocating could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the friend felt it was a mutual agreement. The author's friend might feel that the author used him for sex without considering his feelings. \n\nBut the author didn't lie about his orientation from the start. The friend might have known the arrangement was casual. However, by continuing the arrangement when the author had a girlfriend, the author might have been inconsistent. When the girlfriend left, resuming the arrangement could imply to the friend that the author was open to a more committed relationship, which the author then rejected when he tried to reciprocate. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not being clear about the boundaries and leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend's reaction being cold could be due to feeling used or unappreciated. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was honest about his orientation and tried to end it politely. The friend might be taking it harder than expected. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might be in the wrong because maintaining a sexual relationship with a friend can lead to emotional complications. Even if consensual, ending it can hurt the other person's feelings. The author might have not considered the friend's emotional state, especially since the friend is gay and might have had stronger feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend, then ended it, causing emotional harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
