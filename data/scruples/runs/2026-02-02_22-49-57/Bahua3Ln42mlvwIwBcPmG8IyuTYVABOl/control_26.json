I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered oral sex, and the author accepted because he was single and horny. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the oral sex. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then quickly stopped and told the friend they needed to stop. Now the friend is distant and unresponsive. The author is confused because others say it's his fault, but he didn't lead the friend on, since he's straight and clear about his preferences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. The author's actions involved engaging in sexual activity with a friend, which could be problematic depending on the consent, communication, and emotional impact.\n\nFrom the start, the author is upfront about his orientation, stating he's straight and heteroflexible. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author accepted. However, when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows some consideration for the girlfriend's feelings. But when the relationship ended, the activity resumed. Then, the author tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended it, explaining that they should stop.\n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014becoming cold and distant\u2014might be because he felt used or that the author didn't value the friendship as much once the sexual aspect was no longer there. The author is now struggling with how to handle the friend's withdrawal, wondering if he's the bad guy.\n\nPossible angles: The author's initial acceptance might be seen as taking advantage of the friend's affection. Even if he's straight, engaging in sexual activity with a friend, especially when the friend is gay, might be exploitative. Also, the fact that the author only reciprocated once and then stopped could leave the friend feeling rejected or undervalued. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was a deeper emotional connection or mutual affection beyond just casual sex, leading to hurt feelings when it ended.\n\nHowever, the author did communicate that they're straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. They also stopped the activity after reciprocating once. The friend initiated the encounters each time, so maybe the friend is also responsible for continuing the arrangement despite the author's orientation.\n\nBut in many cases, even if a person is open about their orientation, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can lead to emotional complications. The author might not have considered the emotional state of the friend, leading to hurt feelings. The friend's coldness suggests that he felt the relationship was more meaningful to him than to the author, especially after the author reciprocated briefly but then ended it.\n\nAnother point: The author's use of a gay friend for sexual satisfaction while being straight could be seen as exploiting the friend's affection. Even if consensual, it might be emotionally manipulative if the friend was seeking more than just a casual encounter.\n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't lead the friend on, but the friend's actions (initiating, continuing after the author had a girlfriend, then getting upset when it stopped) suggest that the friend might have had unmet emotional needs. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating once could be seen as abrupt, especially if the friend was invested.\n\nIn summary, while the author was honest about their orientation and stopped the activity when it made them uncomfortable, their actions might have inadvertently caused the friend to feel used or not respected. The key issue is whether the author understood the emotional implications of their actions and whether they respected the friend's feelings beyond just physical gratification. Since the friend is now distant, it's possible that the author's actions led to emotional harm, even if unintended. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's emotional state and continuing the arrangement despite potential emotional consequences.\n"
