I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a straight/heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, and resumed after the breakup. The issue arises when the author stops the arrangement again, causing the friend to become distant. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clear about his orientation and boundaries from the start. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted, which is a mutual agreement. The key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't lead the friend on; he was upfront about not being in a relationship with him. However, when the author decided to stop again, he communicated it nicely. The friend's reaction is coldness and distance, which the author is upset about because they were close friends before.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The friend's actions might be influenced by feelings of rejection or unrequited attraction, but the author isn't responsible for the friend's emotions if he was honest about his intentions and boundaries. The author isn't in a relationship with the friend and made that clear. The problem might stem from the friend's expectations versus the reality of the situation. The author acted in accordance with his own boundaries and communicated them, so he isn't necessarily at fault. However, the friend's hurt feelings are valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
