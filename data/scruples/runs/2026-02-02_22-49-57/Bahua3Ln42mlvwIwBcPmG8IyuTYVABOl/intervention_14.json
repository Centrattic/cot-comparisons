I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, which they both ended after he got a girlfriend and then resumed after the breakup. The author stopped the arrangement after reciprocating once and feeling bad, but now the friend is being cold. Others say it's the author's fault for leading the friend on, but the author claims it was clear he's straight and not interested romantically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is heterosexual but heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex encounters but not in a romantic way. The friend is gay, so his attraction is towards men. The initial arrangement was mutual and consensual, right? Both were adults, 18 years old, so legally adults. They had an understanding that it was just physical and not romantic. \n\nThe issue arises when the author decides to stop because he felt uncomfortable reciprocating. The friend is upset and becoming distant. The author is confused because he thought the boundaries were clear. Others in the community think he's leading the friend on, but the author says there was no romantic intent. \n\nSo, the key points are: mutual consent, clear understanding of no romance, the author's change of heart, and the friend's reaction. \n\nIs the author wrong for engaging in the sexual activity in the first place? If both parties consented and there's no deception, maybe not. But maybe the problem is that the author's actions, even if not romantic, could have given false hope to the friend, especially if the friend might have thought there was a possibility of something more. The author claims he made his stance clear, but maybe the friend interpreted the physical intimacy as a sign of deeper interest. \n\nWhen the author reciprocated, he felt bad and ended it, which shows he's aware of potential issues. Then, the friend's coldness could be due to feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author is now trying to reconnect, but the friend isn't responding. \n\nThe other people's opinion that the author led him on could be based on the idea that any sexual relationship, even without romance, can be confusing. If the friend saw it as a way to have a connection that the author isn't willing to maintain, it might feel like the author is pulling away. \n\nBut the author didn't make promises or act in a way that implied romantic interest. The problem here might be more about the friend's feelings of rejection rather than the author's actions being wrong. The author made a choice to stop when he felt uncomfortable, which is a responsible action. However, the emotional impact on the friend is real, even if unintended. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if both parties agreed to a non-romantic arrangement and the author followed through with stopping it when he felt it was necessary, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's reaction is about his own feelings of loss or rejection, which might not be the author's fault. \n\nBut some might argue that even with clear communication, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can create unmet expectations. The author might have inadvertently given the friend hope for a deeper connection, which he wasn't ready to provide. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were deceptive or not. Since the author claims there was no deception and the friend is now upset for other reasons, perhaps the author isn't at fault. The friend's coldness is a result of his own emotional response, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing.\n"
