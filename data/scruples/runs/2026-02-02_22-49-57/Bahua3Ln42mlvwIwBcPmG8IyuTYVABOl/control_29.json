I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a heterosexual man who's into a bit of heteroflexibility. He had a good friend who's gay and offered him a blowjob. He accepted, and they did this a few times over weeks or months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Eventually, the author felt bad about the imbalance and reciprocated, but then regretted it and told his friend to stop. Now the friend is cold and distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. The author didn't force anything; he even stopped when he felt it wasn't right for him. The friend might be hurt because the author reciprocated and then ended it, but the author was clear about his boundaries from the start. The main issue might be the friend's reaction, possibly feeling rejected. However, the author did try to reach out again, but the friend became distant. \n\nFriends might have different expectations, and the act of reciprocation might have changed the dynamic, leading to hurt feelings. The author's actions were consensual and he communicated his boundaries. The problem now is the friend's response, but the initial actions don't seem malicious. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where the ongoing arrangement could have been a problem, but the author did stop when he felt it wasn't right. Considering all that, the answer is B.\n"
