I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then broke it off after getting a girlfriend and later, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author clarifies he's heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex experiences but isn't exclusively gay. The friend is gay and offered a blowjob, which the author accepted. They continued this for a while, then stopped when the author had a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt uncomfortable and reciprocated once, then ended it. Now, the friend is cold, and others think the author led him on.\n\nThe key points to consider are consent, communication, and intentions. Both were adults (18), and initially, there was mutual consent. The author made it clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the act of reciprocating (sucking the friend) might have sent mixed signals, even if brief. The friend's reaction of becoming distant suggests hurt feelings, possibly due to feeling used or not respected.\n\nEven though the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the back-and-forth could create confusion. The friend might have hoped for more than a sexual arrangement, or felt that the author was taking advantage of his feelings. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could be seen as abrupt, leaving the friend without closure.\n\nThe author is now seeking to mend the friendship but faces resistance. The fact that others in the sub said he's at fault might be because they perceive him as not being considerate of the friend's emotional state. Even if the author didn't mean to, the actions could have made the friend feel objectified or disrespected.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while there was consent, the ongoing arrangement might have been emotionally taxing on the friend. The author's change in behavior (reciprocating then stopping) might have added to the friend's confusion and hurt. The author should have considered the friend's feelings more thoroughly when ending the relationship.\n\nSo, even though there was no coercion, the author might have failed to maintain clear boundaries and communicate effectively, leading the friend to feel used. Hence, the author could be at fault for not being more sensitive to the friend's emotional needs.\n"
