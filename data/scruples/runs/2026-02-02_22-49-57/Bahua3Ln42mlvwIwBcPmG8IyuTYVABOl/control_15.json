I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then broke things off after getting a girlfriend and later when he felt uncomfortable. Now the friend is being cold, and others say it's the author's fault.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author is clear from the start that he's not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend offered a blowjob, which the author accepted multiple times. When he gets a girlfriend, they stop, and then resume after the breakup. The author then reciprocates, feels bad, and ends things. The friend is now distant.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims it was clear he wasn't interested romantically, just casual. However, the friend might have had different expectations. Even if there was no romantic intent, the act of reciprocating might have been a turning point. The author then ends things, which could be seen as abrupt or not handled sensitively. The friend's reaction is understandable if he felt used or that the relationship was one-sided. The author's attempts to reconnect are met with coldness, which might be hurt feelings or feeling rejected. The author might think he did nothing wrong, but the friend's perspective is important here. The advice given is to leave him alone, but the author is conflicted because they were friends. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong if there was no deception. But the friend might feel that the sexual relationship was a form of emotional manipulation or that the author didn't consider his feelings. The fact that the author reciprocated and then stopped could be a point. Also, the ongoing friendship after the sexual encounters might have given the friend hope for more. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether he was honest and consistent in his intentions. If he was clear from the start and maintained that, maybe not. But if his actions (like continuing the relationship after the friend's efforts) led to confusion, then maybe. The friend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author might not have intended to lead him on. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on the clarity of communication and whether the author's actions were respectful given the friend's feelings. If the author was honest but the friend still feels hurt, it's a complex situation. However, the author ending the arrangement due to discomfort is understandable. The friend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
