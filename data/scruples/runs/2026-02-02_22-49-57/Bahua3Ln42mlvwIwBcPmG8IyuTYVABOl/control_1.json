I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight but heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend offer him a blowjob. He accepted it a few times over weeks or months when he was single. Then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Then the author felt bad and reciprocated, but felt awful and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is being cold and distant, and the author is confused because people say he led the friend on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is gay, and the author is straight/heteroflexible. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author accepted. The initial agreement was one-sided, with the friend providing oral sex without reciprocity until later. Then, when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is upset.\n\nThe key points here might be consent and mutual understanding. The author didn't lead on in terms of romantic feelings, but the friend might have had emotional investment. Even if there was no romantic element, the author's actions could be seen as exploiting a friend's feelings for sexual favors. Even though the author was clear about his orientation, the friend might have hoped for more or felt used when the author stopped reciprocating and ended the arrangement.\n\nAlso, the author resumed the activity after getting a girlfriend and then dumped the girlfriend, which could be problematic. When he ended it, he might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the cold response. Even if the author felt it was okay, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions were hurtful.\n\nThe author tried to reach out, but the friend is unresponsive. The author's argument is that he didn't lead the friend on, but the friend might feel that the author took advantage of his feelings. The act of accepting sexual favors without reciprocal emotional or romantic commitment could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the friend was emotionally attached.\n\nIn relationships, even non-romantic, trust and respect are important. The author might be in the wrong because he used the friendship for sexual gratification without considering the friend's emotional needs, especially since the friend is gay and might have had deeper feelings. Even if there was no explicit agreement on reciprocity, the one-sided nature of the arrangement could be problematic when it ended. The author's decision to reciprocate once and then stop might have been confusing or hurtful to the friend.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for not considering the friend's emotional state and for potentially exploiting the friendship for sexual purposes without a mutual understanding of boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
