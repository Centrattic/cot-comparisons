I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation involves a straight guy who had a friend he accepted blowjobs from. Then when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after a breakup, they resumed. The guy felt bad for not reciprocating, so he did, but then was uncomfortable and stopped. Now his friend is being cold, and the user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially, and there's mention that the friend is gay. The key points are that the author was clear about his orientation and didn't reciprocate feelings beyond physical acts. The friend initiated the act, and the author didn't push for anything more. Then, when the author reciprocated once but felt bad and stopped, which could be seen as a change in the dynamic. \n\nThe friend's reaction is now cold, but the author tried to reach out. The advice given in the subreddit said it's the author's fault for leading on, but the author claims he was clear he's straight. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: The author didn't enter into a relationship but had consensual sexual encounters. However, the friend might have developed feelings, even if the author didn't. The act of reciprocating might have sent mixed signals, even if brief. But the author stopped it immediately and communicated clearly. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, consensual acts between adults are okay. Emotionally, maybe the friend felt used or disrespected when the author stopped. But the author didn't lie about his orientation. The problem might be in the friend's expectations versus reality. If the friend is gay, perhaps he had romantic feelings, but the author never indicated interest beyond physical. \n\nSo, the author's actions were consensual and honest about his preferences. The friend's hurt feelings stem from unmet emotional expectations, but that's not the author's fault if there was no prior agreement on emotional involvement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
