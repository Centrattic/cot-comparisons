I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend, and later resumed after the breakup. When he felt uncomfortable with the reciprocal act, he ended the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the key points to consider: The author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author accepted. The arrangement continued for a while, then stopped when the author had a girlfriend. Later, they resumed after the breakup. The author tried to reciprocate but felt bad and ended it, which led to the friend being cold.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The friend's feelings might be hurt because the author ended the arrangement, even if it was mutual and the author was clear about his boundaries. The author might have thought the situation was casual and clear, but the friend could have developed emotional attachment beyond what the author intended. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have led the friend to hope for a more reciprocal or ongoing relationship, which the author was not interested in. The author's friends suggested he's leading the friend on, which is a common issue when casual arrangements are involved. However, the author claims he was clear about his orientation and intentions. \n\nThe main ethical consideration here is whether the author was deceptive or not. Since he was upfront about being straight and the nature of their interactions, he might not be at fault. However, the act of engaging in this relationship despite knowing the potential for emotional harm could be seen as problematic. The author's decision to stop things might have been abrupt, causing the friend to feel rejected. In terms of responsibility, while the author isn't malicious, he might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend, which could make him partially responsible. But the friend also chose to engage in this arrangement knowing the author's orientation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be entirely at fault, there's a gray area. The key is whether the author was clear and honest, which he was. However, the friend's reaction suggests he might have hoped for a more meaningful connection. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. But since the author was honest and the arrangement was mutual, it's debatable. The answer hinges on whether the author's honesty absolves him or if his actions, despite being honest, still caused harm.\n"
