I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a straight guy who had a sexual relationship with his gay friend, then they stopped when he got a girlfriend, but started again when the relationship ended. Then the author felt bad and ended it, leading to the friend being cold. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The friend is gay, and the author is heteroflexible, meaning he can be attracted to other genders but not necessarily into men. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. This was mutual and consensual, right? But then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. So that seems okay because they were both aware of the author's relationship status.\n\nThen the girlfriend broke up, and they resumed the same arrangement. So the author is in a vulnerable emotional state after a breakup, and the friend probably thought it was okay because the author was single again. But then the author decided to reciprocate by giving the friend a blowjob, which made him feel bad. He told the friend he wasn't into that and wanted to stop. The friend became distant, and the author is now trying to reconnect with no success.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and how the actions affected the friend. The author had an ongoing pattern of accepting oral sex from his friend, which the friend might have interpreted as a mutual understanding. When the author reciprocated, maybe the friend felt it was a sign of deeper interest, but the author quickly changed his mind. That could have been confusing for the friend. The author then decided to stop, which might have made the friend feel rejected or used. \n\nEven though the author tried to apologize, the friend's reaction is understandable because he might have felt that the author was leading him on or not being honest about his intentions. The author's actions, while consensual initially, may have created emotional dependence or unmet expectations on the friend's side. The author then didn't follow up properly to address the friend's feelings, leading to the cold response.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they were both 18, so there's a consideration of adult consent, but the main issue is the emotional impact. The author might have thought it was just a casual arrangement, but the friend might have had emotional investment. The author's sudden decision to stop after reciprocal action could have caused hurt, even if unintentionally. \n\nIn terms of leading on, the author said from the start they were straight and wouldn't pursue a romantic relationship. However, the ongoing sexual relationship might have blurred the lines. The friend might have hoped for something more, and the author's actions could have given false hope, even if that wasn't the intention. The author's friends also said it's their fault for leading him on, which adds another perspective that the author's behavior was ambiguous.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't manage the expectations properly. They started a sexual relationship with a friend who's gay, which the author knows is outside his typical preferences. Even though they were clear about being straight, the ongoing interactions might have created confusion. The friend's emotional response is valid, and the author didn't handle the ending of the relationship sensitively, leading to the friend feeling used or rejected. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
