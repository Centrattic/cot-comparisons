I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They started a sexual arrangement where the friend gave him blowjobs. Later, the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author then felt guilty and reciprocated, but realized it made him uncomfortable and ended it. Now, the friend is acting distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The author initially agreed to the arrangement, but later the friend started reciprocating. The author felt bad and ended it. However, the friend is upset now. The author claims he was clear about his straightness and didn't intend to lead the friend on. But did he?\n\nOne thing to consider is the dynamic of the friendship. The author and the friend were engaging in sexual acts, which can complicate a platonic relationship. Even if the author was upfront about being straight, the act of engaging in sexual activity with a friend might have created expectations or emotional investments that the author didn't account for. When the author stopped reciprocating, maybe the friend felt rejected or disrespected. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that after breaking up with the girlfriend, they resumed the arrangement. This could imply that the author's interest was conditional on being single, which might have been a mixed message. The friend might have felt like he was just a substitute for the girlfriend, which could be hurtful.\n\nWhen the author reciprocated once, even if it was a mistake, it might have given the friend false hope. The author then ended it, which could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend's reaction of becoming distant is a natural response to feeling used or rejected.\n\nMoreover, the author is now struggling with maintaining the friendship. The friend's withdrawal suggests that the emotional impact of the situation is significant. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have crossed a line in the friendship that's hard to repair.\n\nIn terms of consent, both parties were adults and agreed, but consent can be ongoing. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating once could be seen as a change in consent, but the friend might not have been prepared for that. The author's responsibility might also extend to considering how their actions affect the friend's feelings beyond the physical act.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might not have intended to hurt the friend, the situation's complexity and the resulting emotional harm suggest that he's at least partially at fault. The key issue is the lack of mutual understanding about boundaries and the impact of the author's actions on the friend's emotional state. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the sexual relationship's dynamics can create unmet expectations, leading to the friend feeling wronged.\n"
