I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single, stopped when he got a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The guy felt bad about the power dynamic, reciprocated once, then ended it because he didn't feel comfortable. Now the friend is cold and distant, and the user is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. The user didn't force anything; it was mutual. When he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows he respected his girlfriend's expectations. After the breakup, they resumed, still with mutual agreement. The user then felt uncomfortable with the one-sided nature and reciprocated, but felt bad and ended it. He communicated this clearly without being mean. \n\nThe friend's reaction is now coldness, but the user tried to reach out, which was ignored. The user's actions were honest and he tried to maintain boundaries. The advice from others suggests he led the friend on, but the user didn't promise anything beyond the physical arrangement. The friend's emotional reaction might stem from unmet expectations or possible feelings of rejection, but the user didn't deceive him about his sexuality or intentions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user acted within his boundaries and communicated his feelings when they changed. The friend's response is more about his own feelings, which the user can't control. So, the user isn't in the wrong for acting within his comfort and honesty. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
