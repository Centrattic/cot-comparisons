I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the setup: a straight, heteroflexible man has a gay friend who offered him a blowjob. The author accepted, and they continued this arrangement for a while. Then, after getting a girlfriend and breaking up, they resumed. The author later tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended things. Now, the friend is distant, leading the author to question if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no expectation of a romantic relationship. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author participated without pressure. However, after the author ended the arrangement, the friend became cold. \n\nThe key issues here might be whether the author's actions were manipulative or if there was a lack of clear boundaries. The author says he was honest about his sexuality and that the arrangement was mutual. But the friend's feelings might have changed, especially after the author reciprocated and then ended it. The author might have unintentionally led the friend to hope for a deeper connection, even if he didn't intend to. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author had a girlfriend and then resumed the arrangement after the breakup could be a point. However, the user mentions that they stopped when he got a girlfriend, so that's addressed. \n\nThe responses from others say the author led the friend on, but the author claims it was clear he was straight. The friend's reaction suggests he felt hurt, possibly due to unmet emotional attachments. Even if the author didn't intend to, his actions might have given the friend false hope. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if both parties consented and there was no deception initially, the author might not be at fault. But ending the arrangement after reciprocation could have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if the friend had deeper feelings. The author's actions were honest about his orientation, but the emotional impact is still a factor. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. If the author was upfront and consensual, he's not entirely at fault. However, the friend's emotional response is valid. The author might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled the ending more sensitively. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author was honest and the arrangement was mutual, though the aftermath might require more empathy.\n"
