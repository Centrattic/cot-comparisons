I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, causing the friend to become distant. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible but identifies as straight. The friend is gay and offered to perform a blowjob. The author accepted, and they continued this for some time. Then, the author had a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Later, the author reciprocated but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nThe author's main points are that there was no emotional lead; the friend knew he was straight and not interested romantically. The friend initiated, and the author didn't push. However, the author is now being criticized for leading the friend on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider consent, communication, and intent. The author didn't force anything. The friend approached him. The author made it clear he's not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the ongoing sexual arrangement might have created expectations or emotional attachments on the friend's side. Even if the author didn't lead on emotionally, the physical intimacy could have led the friend to feel something more or expect reciprocity beyond just the sexual acts.\n\nWhen the author reciprocated, he immediately felt bad and ended it. The friend might have felt rejected or hurt, leading to the cold response. Even though the author tried to explain, the friend's reaction suggests he felt hurt. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend, assuming the arrangement was purely physical. However, the friend's investment might have been more significant, leading to feelings of betrayal or rejection when it ended.\n\nBut the author did make it clear he's straight and not interested romantically. The friend initiated the sexual acts. So, maybe the problem is that the author didn't consider the friend's feelings when ending it. Even if it was consensual, ending a sexual relationship can be as impactful as ending a romantic one. The author might be at fault for not handling the end of the arrangement more sensitively, even if there was no romantic intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction could be an overreaction. The author tried to communicate and even sent a message, but the friend didn't respond well. The author might not be in the wrong if they were clear and consensual. However, the ongoing dynamic could have created emotional ties that the author didn't anticipate. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful and considerate. Since the author ended it for their own comfort, maybe they aren't at fault. But the way it was handled might have hurt the friend, making the author partially responsible for the fallout.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though there was no romantic intent, the author's actions might have given the friend false hope or not communicated the end of the arrangement properly, leading to emotional distress. The author should have been more careful in how they ended it, considering the friend's feelings, even if they were clear about their orientation.\n"
