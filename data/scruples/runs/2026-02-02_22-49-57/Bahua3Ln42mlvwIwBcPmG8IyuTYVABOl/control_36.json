I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for accepting blowjobs from a gay friend and then ending it. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but identifies as heteroflexible. A gay friend offered to perform oral sex, and they engaged in this multiple times. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author later felt bad and reciprocated, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others said it's their fault for leading the friend on, but they claim it was clear they're not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about consent, mutual understanding, and boundaries. The author and the friend had a sexual arrangement. The author might not have seen it as leading on because there was no romantic component, but the friend might have developed feelings or felt rejected when the author ended the arrangement. Even if the author was clear about their orientation, the act of engaging in sexual activities with a friend could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the friend's affectionate gestures or emotional investment were misread.\n\nHowever, the author didn't explicitly promise anything; they just had a sexual relationship that was later terminated. The friend's reaction might be more about unmet emotional needs or taking the rejection personally. The author's actions could be seen as honest\u2014stating their boundaries\u2014and the problem might stem from the friend's emotional response rather than the author's fault. But in terms of maintaining the friendship, the author's decision to end the sexual activity might have been abrupt, leading to the friend's resentment.\n\nIn some perspectives, even if the sexual relationship was consensual, it can complicate a friendship, especially if one person becomes emotionally involved. The author might be in the right for setting boundaries, but the way they ended it and the subsequent handling could be seen as insensitive. However, the friend's behavior post-termination (being cold) is also a factor. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping the sexual activity, but they might be at fault for not managing the transition back to a platonic friendship more carefully. But given the information, the main issue is the friend's reaction rather than the author's actions. So, maybe the answer is B (No), but I need to check if there's any explicit wrongdoing. The author did agree to the arrangement and then ended it, which is their right. The friend's coldness is their problem. So the answer is B.\n"
