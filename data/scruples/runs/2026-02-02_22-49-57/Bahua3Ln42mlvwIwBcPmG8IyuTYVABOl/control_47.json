I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy and a gay friend who offered a blowjob. The author accepted, continued the arrangement, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, resumed after the breakup, and then tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable, leading the friend to become distant.\n\nFirst, the initial acceptance of the Blowjob (BJ) when the friend is gay. The author is straight but heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex experiences. The key point here is consent. Both parties agreed, so initially, there's no issue. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good because it's about maintaining boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThen, after the breakup, they resumed the BJ arrangement. Here, the author might have led the friend on by implying that the relationship could continue, especially after the girlfriend left. The problem arises when the author decides he wants to reciprocate. By doing so, the friend might feel that the author is using him or not respecting his position as the one performing the act. The author's immediate discomfort and decision to stop could have been hurtful, leading to the friend feeling rejected or used.\n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that the author led him on. Even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the physical interactions might have given the friend hope for a more meaningful relationship. The author's actions could have created mixed signals. The friend might feel that the author was using him for his sexuality without considering his feelings. The fact that the author is straight and the friend is gay means the dynamic is one-sided, which can be problematic if the friend starts to have feelings or expects more from the arrangement.\n\nThe author's attempt to reciprocate might have been a mistake. It could have made the friend feel like the author was trying to balance things or that he expected something in return. The friend's cold reaction shows he's hurt, possibly feeling that the author was insincere from the start.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings. Even if there was no romantic intent, the physical relationship could have led to emotional attachment on the friend's side. The author's decision to stop abruptly after reciprocating might have been the final straw. The friend's withdrawal is a natural response to feeling used or unappreciated.\n\nSo, while there's no malicious intent, the author's actions likely led to the friend feeling hurt. The key issue is the imbalance in the relationship and not considering the emotional impact. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries and for not foreseeing the emotional consequences of their actions.\n"
