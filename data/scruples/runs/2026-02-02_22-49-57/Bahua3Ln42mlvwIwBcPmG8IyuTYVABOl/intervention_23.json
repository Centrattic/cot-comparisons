I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation involves him accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then later breaking up when he gets a girlfriend, and then after the breakup, they start again. Then he feels bad and stops, leading the friend to become distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the two. The author is a straight guy, but he's described as heteroflexible, which I think means he's open to some same-sex experiences. The friend is gay and offered the service. So initially, it's a mutual agreement when both are single. Then when the author has a girlfriend, they stop, which seems reasonable because they wouldn't want to cheat. Then after the breakup, they start again. \n\nThe author later feels uncomfortable with the reciprocal act (sucking him) and stops it. He tells the friend nicely that it's not for him. The friend becomes cold, and the author is trying to reconnect but is getting ignored. The author is confused because they were close friends before and now there's a rift.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues that he was clear about his orientation and that he didn't lead the friend on. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author didn't push for a relationship beyond the physical acts. However, when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and stopped, which might have hurt the friend's feelings. \n\nFrom a standpoint of consent and mutual agreement, the initial acts were consensual. But maybe the friend felt that the author was using him for pleasure without reciprocation, leading to hurt feelings when the author stopped. The author's friend might have hoped for more reciprocity or emotional connection, which didn't happen. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to explain his feelings, the friend became distant. The author is now trying to mend the friendship but is being ignored. The key here is whether the author's actions, especially the sudden stop and not explaining further, led to the friend feeling rejected or used. \n\nThe author claims he was clear about his straightness and didn't want a relationship, but maybe the friend saw the sexual acts as a form of intimacy that went beyond just physical. The author's stopping might have been perceived as a betrayal or rejection. \n\nHowever, the author did communicate his discomfort and tried to be respectful. The friend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe the friend felt emotionally invested in the relationship beyond the physical. The author might not be entirely at fault, but there's a part where he might have not considered the friend's emotional state when he stopped. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did stop when he felt uncomfortable, which is valid. The friend might need to process his feelings, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But there's a nuance here where the author could have handled the stop more sensitively, but since he did explain it nicely, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nI think the key factors are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. Both agreed to the initial arrangement. The author later changed his mind and communicated it, which is his right. The friend's reaction is his own issue to handle, but the author isn't the one in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer would be B.\n"
