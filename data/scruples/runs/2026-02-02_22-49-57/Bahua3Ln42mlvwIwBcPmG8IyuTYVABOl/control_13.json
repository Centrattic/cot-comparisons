A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight heteroflexible guy, and a gay friend offered him blowjobs. He accepted, and they had this arrangement for a while. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped, but when she dumped him, they started again. The author felt bad for the friend always giving, so he tried to reciprocate but immediately felt awful and told him it wasn't his thing. Now, the friend is being cold and distant, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear about not leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is straight but describes himself as heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex experiences but not a full commitment. The friend is gay and offered the service, which the author accepted. The key points here are consent, communication, and the nature of their relationship. \n\nFrom the start, the author was upfront about being straight and not wanting a romantic or emotional relationship. That's good communication. However, even if the author was clear, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can complicate the relationship. The friend might have felt attached or wanted more than just a casual arrangement. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which suggests the friend was okay with boundaries being set. But when the girlfriend left, the author went back to the same behavior. This could be seen as inconsistent or taking advantage of the friend's feelings, even if the author didn't intend to lead them on. \n\nThe author then tried to reciprocate, which the friend might have seen as a sign of a shift in the dynamic, but the author immediately regretted it and ended it. The friend's hurt feelings might stem from the sudden change and the prior pattern of starting and stopping. \n\nThe friend's response of becoming distant could be a result of feeling used or not respected. Even if the author was clear, the friend might have developed emotional feelings over time, which the author didn't consider. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have emotional consequences the friend isn't handling well. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend, even if it was casual, and then changed the rules abruptly. The friend was probably relying on the established dynamic, and when it shifted, they felt rejected. The author's role in maintaining boundaries and respecting the friend's potential feelings is important here. Even if he's straight, the friend might have felt that the author was using them, or was inconsistent, leading to hurt. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was clear about his orientation and the friend understood it was purely physical, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping it when he felt uncomfortable. But the fact that the friend was giving while the author was receiving, and then the author tried to reciprocate but immediately regretted it, might indicate some level of manipulation or lack of consideration. \n\nThe community's response (saying it's the author's fault for leading him on) could be valid if the author didn't maintain consistent communication about his feelings or boundaries. The author might have given mixed signals by engaging in the relationship when he was single and then stopping when in a relationship, then trying to reciprocate later. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author was upfront, the act of starting and stopping without considering the friend's emotional state could be why the friend is upset. The author might be in the wrong for not being more mindful of the friend's feelings, even if the friend is now acting distant. So, the answer is A.\n"
