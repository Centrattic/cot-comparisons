I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight guy who had a friend who's gay. The friend offered him a blowjob, and he accepted because he was single and horny. They kept doing that for a while. Then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, he felt bad and reciprocated, but then realized it wasn't his thing and ended it. Now the friend is being distant and cold, and the author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend is gay, so maybe he was looking for more than just a physical encounter? But the author's intentions were just about the physical aspect. However, by engaging in this arrangement, maybe the friend felt there was a level of emotional connection or hope for something more, which the author didn't reciprocate. \n\nWhen the author reciprocated once, he felt awful and ended it. That might have been a clear boundary setting, but perhaps the friend felt rejected or that the author was inconsistent. The author's actions could have given mixed signals. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the ongoing physical relationship might have led the friend to believe there was a mutual, albeit non-romantic, emotional bond that the author is now cutting off by ending the physical encounters. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to reconnect after the break-up, the friend became distant. The author might be feeling guilty for causing the friend pain, but maybe the friend felt used or that his feelings were disregarded. The key question is whether the author's actions were manipulative or if he was honest about his boundaries from the start. If the friend initiated the first time and the author was clear about his intentions, then the fault might not be on the author. However, continuing the arrangement for months could have led to emotional entanglement, which the author didn't consider. \n\nAnother angle is that engaging in sexual acts, even if both parties are okay with it, can create unspoken expectations. The author ending it might have been a betrayal from the friend's perspective, even if the author was upfront about not wanting a romantic relationship. The friend might have developed feelings over time, which the author didn't account for. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if he was clear about his boundaries and the friend understood them. However, the ongoing physical relationship might have created emotional dependency on the friend's side, leading to hurt feelings when it ended. The author did try to communicate and stop things when he felt uncomfortable, which is good, but maybe didn't consider the emotional impact on the friend. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how each person perceives the situation. In some contexts, this kind of arrangement is acceptable as long as both parties are okay with it, but the sudden end could be hurtful regardless. So, the author might not be at fault, but there's a possibility he underestimated the emotional consequences.\n"
