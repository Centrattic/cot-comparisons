I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it when he got a girlfriend, and after the breakup, resumed the arrangement. Then when he felt bad and stopped, the friend became distant.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex experiences but not necessarily a gay relationship. The friend is gay, so he's likely seeking emotional or physical connections. The key points are the initial agreement between friends, then resuming after the girlfriend dumps the author. When the author decides to stop, the friend feels hurt and becomes distant.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as leading the friend on, even if he stated he was straight. The friend might have hoped for more than just a sexual relationship, especially since they were close friends. The author's decision to stop, even if justified by his own feelings, might have caused emotional harm. The friends' reactions in the sub suggest the author is at fault for not being clear or for continuing the arrangement after the girlfriend left, leading the friend to expect more. However, the author claims he was clear about his orientation and didn't lead on. But actions can speak louder than words, and the ongoing sexual relationship might have given mixed signals. The author might not be in the wrong if he was honest from the start, but the friend's feelings of being used or manipulated could make the author responsible. It's a bit tricky, but since the author ended the relationship and the friend is upset, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the initial arrangement could have been exploitative, so there's a case for A or B. The answer might hinge on whether the author was deceptive or not. Since he stated his orientation early on, maybe he's not in the wrong. So I think answer B.\n"
