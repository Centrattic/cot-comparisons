I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but heteroflexible. He had a gay friend who offered to give him blowjobs, which they continued for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, which led to them stopping. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author then realized that the friend was always giving and not receiving, so the author reciprocated, but felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is being cold and distant.\n\nThe friends used to be close, and the author wants to maintain the friendship. The other people in the sub said it's the author's fault for leading him on. The author argues that he was clear he's not gay, wouldn't kiss him, etc.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author and friend started this arrangement with clear boundaries, according to the author. The friend was okay with it when they first started, and when the author ended it, he did so politely. The friend's reaction is now making the author question if he did something wrong.\n\nBut maybe the issue is that even though the author thought they had a mutual understanding, the friend might have had different expectations. The fact that the author started reciprocating shows he felt guilty, but then stopped because it made him uncomfortable. However, the friend's coldness suggests he might have felt rejected or hurt, even if the author didn't lead him on. \n\nAlso, the act of reciprocating might have been a mistake, even if brief, because it could have confused the friend. The author might have inadvertently made the friend feel like there was a chance of a mutual relationship, which wasn't the case. Even if the author is straight, the friend might have hoped for more, and the author's actions, while well-intentioned, could have sent mixed signals.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions with the friend while in a relationship (after the breakup) might have been considered a betrayal by the ex, but the author's current situation is about the friend's reaction. The author's decision to end the arrangement might have hurt the friend's feelings, even if it was communicated politely. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend, assuming that the friend understood the boundaries were strictly sexual and not emotional. \n\nSo, even if the author thought they were clear, the friend might have developed feelings, especially if there was an ongoing intimate relationship. The author's reciprocation, however brief, could have given the friend hope that there was mutual interest, which the author then denied. That could be leading him on, even unintentionally.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author might have assumed that the friend would accept the cessation of the arrangement without taking it personally. But if the friend's actions were based on emotional attachment beyond just the physical, the author's actions might have contributed to the friend's hurt feelings. The author's responsibility includes considering the friend's emotional state and maintaining the friendship after ending the arrangement.\n\nTherefore, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the friend's perspective is important. The author might be in the wrong for not fully considering how ending the arrangement would affect their friend's feelings and the friendship. So, the answer might be A.\n"
