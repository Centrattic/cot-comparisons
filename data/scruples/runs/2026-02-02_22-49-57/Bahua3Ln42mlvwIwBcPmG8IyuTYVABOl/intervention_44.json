I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend. They started when he was single, then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed, but he later felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now his friend is being distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially, right? The author mentions that the friend offered and he accepted. But then there's the issue of when he had a girlfriend. Even though they stopped during that time, after the breakup, they resumed. The friend is gay, so maybe there's an imbalance in the relationship dynamics. The author is straight, so the friend was performing oral sex without expecting a return, which the author later reciprocated, but felt bad about. \n\nThe key points are about honesty and communication. The author didn't lead on the friend in terms of romantic feelings, but there's a power dynamic where the friend might have felt it was a one-sided exchange. When the author decided to stop, he did it politely, but the friend is now upset. The author is confused because they were close friends before. \n\nThe friends' reaction might be due to feeling used or not respected. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend might have felt that the author was taking advantage. Also, the fact that the author reciprocated once but felt sick about it could indicate discomfort that the friend might not have wanted to continue. \n\nBut the author did communicate clearly that he's not interested in a romantic relationship. The problem might be more about the friend's feelings of being humiliated or the arrangement becoming one-sided. The author might not be in the wrong because he didn't force the friend and stopped when he felt it was wrong. However, there's a possibility that the author didn't consider the friend's feelings enough, assuming mutual comfort in the arrangement. \n\nIn relationships, even casual ones, communication is key. If the author didn't ask the friend if they were okay with continuing after the author's girlfriend broke up, or if the friend felt pressured, then maybe the author is at fault. But since the friend offered initially, maybe it's mutual. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction could be due to feeling rejected or not respected when the author stopped reciprocating. The author's actions might have hurt the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. So, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending it, the way it was handled might have caused hurt feelings. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because both parties were consenting, but maybe there's a lack of understanding about the emotional impact. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the friend's perspective and the dynamics, maybe there's some fault. But I'm leaning towards B (No) because the author communicated his boundaries and didn't force anything.\n"
