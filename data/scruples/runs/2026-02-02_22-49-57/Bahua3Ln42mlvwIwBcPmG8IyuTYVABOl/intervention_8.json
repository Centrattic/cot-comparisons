I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a straight-identifying person having oral sex with a gay friend, then ending it and facing backlash.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means they might be open to same-sex experiences but not necessarily identify as bisexual or gay. The friend is gay and initiated the oral sex. The author engaged in this because they were single and horny, then later had a girlfriend, stopped, and then resumed after the breakup. The key point is that the author was clear from the start that they aren't interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. \n\nWhen the author's girlfriend dumped them, they resumed the arrangement. Then, the author felt guilty and reciprocated, but immediately regretted it and ended things. Now the friend is being distant and cold, leading the author to question their actions. The friend's reaction might be due to feeling used or unappreciated, but the author claims they were upfront about their boundaries.\n\nThe community's advice was that the author led the friend on, but the author argues they were clear about their orientation. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong despite their intentions. \n\nPossible angles: Did the author mislead the friend? The author stated they are straight and not into emotional connections. However, engaging in sexual acts could imply a level of commitment or reciprocity that the friend expected. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if there was an unspoken expectation of mutual benefit. \n\nBut since the author was upfront and the friend initiated the arrangement, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the friend's hurt feelings and withdrawal might suggest that the author's actions, while not malicious, were careless. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional investment in the relationship beyond the sexual aspect. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the author was honest about their orientation and boundaries, they might not be in the wrong. But if the actions caused harm despite the honesty, there's a gray area. The main issue is whether the author respected the friend's feelings. The friend might have seen the arrangement as more meaningful than the author did. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong), but there's a need to acknowledge the friend's feelings and maybe take responsibility for the impact, even if unintentional.\n"
