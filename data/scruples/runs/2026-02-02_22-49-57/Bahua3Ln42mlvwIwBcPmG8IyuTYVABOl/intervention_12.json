I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the described situation. The scenario involves a straight male accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then later ending the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but is seeking confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The author mentions it was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend offered, and they both agreed to the arrangement. There's no indication of coercion or non-consensual acts. \n\nThen, when the author gets a girlfriend, they stop the arrangement, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resume, and then the author feels bad and stops again, explaining his feelings. The friend becomes distant afterward. The author tried to reach out, but the friend is unresponsive. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author didn't misrepresent his intentions; he was clear about his straight identity. The issue arises when the author ends the arrangement, which might have left the friend feeling rejected or used. However, since there was no romantic or emotional commitment, the author's actions might be seen as honest. \n\nBut some might argue that even if it was consensual, the ongoing dynamic could have led the friend to develop feelings of attachment or expectation. The author ending the relationship, even if it was just a sexual arrangement, could be hurtful. However, the author tried to communicate his discomfort when he reciprocated, showing he considered the friend's feelings.\n\nI need to check if the author crossed any boundaries. The friend initiated, and the author accepted without pressure. The problem comes when stopping, but stopping is his right. The friend's reaction is more about his own feelings than the author's actions. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe there's a lesson in how to handle endings more sensitively. But in terms of right or wrong, the author acted within his rights as long as both parties consented and there's no deceit.\n"
