I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this scenario. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible man who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later dumping him again. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is straight but heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but not necessarily a full relationship. He and his friend had a mutual understanding where the friend provided blowjobs, and this went on for a while. When the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the relationship ended, they resumed. The author then tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is distant, and others say the author led him on.\n\nThe main ethical questions here are about consent, honesty, and emotional harm. The author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no expectation of a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used after the arrangement ended. Even if there was no explicit promise, the ongoing nature of the relationship could have created emotional dependency. The author's action of stopping after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if he had emotional investment beyond just the sexual aspect.\n\nThe author's responsibility here might be in not recognizing the potential emotional impact on his friend. Even if they had a mutual understanding initially, ending the arrangement abruptly could be seen as breaking trust or causing emotional distress. The friend's coldness is a reaction to feeling rejected or manipulated, even if that's not the author's intention. The author might not have been intentionally leading him on, but the way he handled the end of the arrangement could have been insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to communicate his boundaries and ended it amicably. The friend's reaction might be overly harsh, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of any responsibility. The key is whether the author acted in a way that was considerate of his friend's feelings throughout. Since the author is now distressed about losing a friend, it's a two-sided situation. However, the initial arrangement might have been built on a fragile foundation where the friend's needs for emotional or sexual connection weren't fully considered by the author. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, the author might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for him to take responsibility for how the end of the arrangement affected his friend. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author was honest and set boundaries, but there's a case for A if the author didn't consider the emotional impact. Given the context, the author's actions were within his autonomy, but the aftermath shows that he might need to reflect on how his actions affected others. The final answer is B, but with the nuance that while he's not wrong, he should consider his friend's feelings more.\n"
