I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the described situation. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a man who identifies as straight but is heteroflexible. His gay friend offered to give him a blowjob, and he accepted. They engaged in this over several weeks or months. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, they resumed. The author later decided to reciprocate by giving a blowjob but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and communication. Both parties initially agreed to the arrangement, and the author didn't lead the friend on by pretending to have romantic feelings. The friend knew the author's orientation. However, when the author ended the arrangement, the friend felt hurt. The author tried to reach out, but the friend was unresponsive.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if both parties consented and there's no coercion, it's not illegal. But socially, there might be issues. The author's friend might feel rejected or devalued, even if the author didn't intend to. The fact that the friend is now distant suggests emotional harm, which the author may have caused unintentionally. Also, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can complicate the relationship if one party feels it's not mutual or if one stops participating.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if they didn't fully consider the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement. Even though the author tried to be nice, the friend's reaction indicates that the way they stopped might have been hurtful. The author might need to reflect on whether they communicated their decision clearly and showed empathy towards the friend's feelings.\n\nHowever, the author didn't mislead the friend about their orientation. They were honest from the start. The friend's behavior being \"cold and distant\" is on them, but the author's responsibility is to be respectful in ending the arrangement. The key question is whether the author acted unkindly or inconsiderately. The author said they told the friend nicely, so maybe not intentionally. But the impact is that the friend feels rejected. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that the author shouldn't have engaged in the sexual acts in the first place if it could lead to such a rift. But others might say it's between consenting adults. The author's actions aren't malicious, but the outcome is a broken friendship. The author might be at fault for not foreseeing the friend's emotional needs, but maybe not intentionally wrong. It's a complex situation where social expectations vary.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author didn't act maliciously, their actions contributed to the friend's hurt feelings. They might be partly at fault for not managing the end of the arrangement with more sensitivity. So, the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author was honest and the friend is overreacting, maybe B (No). But the friend's reaction suggests the author's actions had a negative impact, so A might be the right choice.\n"
