I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on a detailed scenario. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when the author was single and horny, continued over time, and stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After a breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The author then felt bad about reciprocating and ended things, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was clear about his orientation and the nature of their relationship from the start. The friend initiated the sexual acts, and the author accepted them without expecting a romantic relationship. The key points here are consent and communication. Both parties were adults (18 years old) and the activities were consensual. The author didn't lead the friend on; he was honest about his preferences. When the author reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement, which is his right. However, the friend's reaction is now causing tension.\n\nThe friends' coldness might stem from feeling used or unappreciated, but the author's actions were based on his own feelings. The author tried to maintain the friendship but the friend is pulling away. The advice from others says it's the author's fault for leading on, but the author didn't promise anything beyond the sexual encounters. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong given the context.\n\nConsidering consent, honesty, and the lack of deceit, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to respect the friend's space. The answer hinges on whether consent and clear communication were maintained, which they were. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
