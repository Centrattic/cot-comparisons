I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their actions. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then broke it off, leading to the friend being cold.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, which complicates the orientation a bit. But the key points are: the gay friend offered a blowjob, they had this arrangement, then the author got a girlfriend and stopped. When the relationship ended, they resumed, but after reciprocating, the author ended it. The friend became distant.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author argues that from the start, they were clear about being straight and not having romantic feelings. The friend initiated the arrangement, and the author didn't lead him on. Others in a sub said it's the author's fault for leading on, but the author denies that. \n\nNow, considering the friend's perspective: even if the author was clear, the ongoing sexual relationship might have given the friend hope for something more than the author intended. The author then reciprocated, which might have made the friend feel more attached. When the author ended it, the friend felt rejected, leading to distance. \n\nHowever, the author's intentions were stated upfront. The issue here is mutual understanding. If the friend entered into the arrangement with the understanding that it was purely physical and no romantic, then the author isn't wrong for ending it. But if the friend developed feelings during the arrangement that the author didn't reciprocate, then the author might have inadvertently led him on, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe author's actions of accepting the arrangement and then later reciprocating could be seen as confusing. Even if the author felt bad afterward, the act of reciprocation might have given the friend signals that weren't accurate. The author then ended the relationship, which the friend might perceive as betrayal, especially after the girlfriend left. \n\nBut the author claims they were always clear about being straight. The problem is that in any relationship, even non-romantic, there's an expectation of honesty. If the author was honest from the start, then the friend might have overstepped by expecting more. However, the author's decision to reciprocate, even if they felt bad afterward, could be seen as creating a false impression. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author might have not been clear enough about their limits after reciprocating. The friend's reaction suggests he felt rejected, which is a valid emotional response, but the author's actions might have contributed to that feeling. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be at fault for not maintaining consistent communication and for reciprocating, which could have led the friend to believe there was mutual interest. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the actions might have done so. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
