I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight guy who had a gay friend offer him a blowjob. He accepted, and they did this a few times. Then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, he felt bad and reciprocated, but then said they should stop. Now the friend is being distant, and the author is confused because he didn't lead him on, just was clear about his straightness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both parties were adults, 18, and it was initiated by the friend. The author didn't push; he accepted the offer. Then when he felt uncomfortable with reciprocal actions, he stopped it. So, maybe he communicated clearly that he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship, just physical stuff. But the friend might have had different expectations, thinking there was a chance for more. \n\nThe author's friend is gay, so maybe he was looking for a romantic connection, but the author was only interested in the physical aspect. Even though the author was clear he's straight, the ongoing physical relationship without emotional commitment might have left the friend feeling used or confused. When the author ended it, even if politely, it could have hurt the friend's feelings, making him feel rejected or that the author was toying with his emotions.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were close friends before and after complicates things. The author might have led the friend to believe there was some level of emotional connection beyond just physical, especially since they were friends and then resumed the activity after the breakup. The friend's reaction of becoming distant suggests he felt hurt or betrayed, even if the author didn't intend to. \n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and clear communication. The author didn't force anything, but perhaps he didn't manage the emotional boundaries well. Even if the friend initiated, the ongoing nature of the relationship without a clear understanding of each other's expectations could lead to hurt feelings. The author might have been aware of the friend's feelings but didn't consider how his actions affected them, leading to the friend feeling used or unappreciated. \n\nIn relationships, even non-romantic ones, emotional intelligence matters. The author's friend might have hoped for more than just physical interactions, and the author's actions, while not malicious, could have been emotionally damaging. Therefore, even if the author didn't lead on intentionally, the result was that the friend felt hurt, making the author partially at fault for not being more considerate of the friend's emotional state.\n"
