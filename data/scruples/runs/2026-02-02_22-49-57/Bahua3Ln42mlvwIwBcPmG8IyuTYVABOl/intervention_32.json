I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a friend offer him a blowjob, which he accepted multiple times. They stopped when he got a girlfriend, but resumed after she dumped him. Then the author felt guilty, reciprocated, but felt bad and ended the arrangement, leading to the friend being distant. The author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both parties were 18 and presumably of age. The author didn't lead the friend on, according to his own account; he was clear about his sexuality. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author didn't force anything. When he felt guilty, he stopped and tried to explain it wasn't about love or romance. The friend's reaction of being cold might be due to hurt feelings or confusion, but the author's actions were consensual each time.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with the ongoing dynamic. Even if consensual, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, especially one-sided, might have built up emotional expectations in the friend. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional state, especially since the friend is gay. The friend might have hoped for more than a one-sided act, leading to feelings of rejection when the author stopped. The author's decision to reciprocate but then stop could have been confusing or hurtful. But the key here is whether there was clear communication. The author says he was clear about not wanting a romantic relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the friendship aspect. The author is concerned about losing his best friend. Ending the sexual activity caused a rift, but if the author communicated his stance clearly and respectfully, then maybe the friend's reaction is his own issue. However, the author might have failed to acknowledge the friend's feelings and the inherent power dynamics in their friendship. Maybe the friend felt used or devalued. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were consensual and he tried to be honest. The friend's hurt might stem from unmet expectations, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he communicated clearly and didn't manipulate. However, some might argue that the ongoing sexual relationship could have led the friend to form emotional attachments that the author didn't address. Since the author ended it respectfully and had previously stopped when he got a girlfriend (which the friend was okay with), it seems he wasn't leading the friend on. The main issue is the friend's reaction, which might be his own problem if there was no deception from the author. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
