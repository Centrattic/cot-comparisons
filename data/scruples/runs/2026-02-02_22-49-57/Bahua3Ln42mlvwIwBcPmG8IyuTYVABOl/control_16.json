I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but describes himself as heteroflexible. He had a gay friend who offered to give him blowjobs. The author accepted, and they did this multiple times over weeks or months. Then, the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but then realized it wasn't what he wanted and stopped. Now, the friend is being cold and distant, and the author is confused because they were close friends before.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent, boundaries, and how the actions affected their friendship. The author argues that he was clear he's not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship beyond the agreed-upon acts. But the friend seems hurt and upset.\n\nI need to consider if the author crossed any lines. He didn't force the friend; the friend offered. But maybe the friend saw this as more than just a one-time thing, or felt that the author was leading him on. The author also mentioned that after reciprocating, he felt awful and ended it. However, the friend's reaction suggests he felt rejected or humiliated.\n\nEven if the author was clear about his orientation, the friend might have developed feelings or felt that the relationship was more intimate than just casual. The act of reciprocating might have made the friend feel that the author was being inconsistent or insincere, leading to the cold response.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were friends and the author used his friend's affection for him could be seen as exploiting the friendship for personal gratification. Friends should be able to trust each other, and this situation might have broken that trust.\n\nThe author tried to mend things by texting a long message, but the friend's minimal response indicates unresolved issues. The author's actions, while consensual, may have caused emotional harm to the friend. Even if there was no romantic expectation from the author, the friend's perspective is important here. The friend might feel used or that his feelings were disregarded when the author stopped reciprocating and ended the arrangement.\n\nIn terms of consent, both parties agreed initially, but the ongoing nature of the acts and the subsequent ending could have led to emotional distress. The author's heteroflexibility doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to consider his friend's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he contributed to a situation where his friend felt used or rejected, even if unintentionally. The key issue is whether the author respected his friend's emotional needs and boundaries throughout. The fact that the friend is now distant suggests that the author's actions had a negative impact, making him at least partially responsible.\n"
