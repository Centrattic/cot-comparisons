I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves two 18-year-old males who had an arrangement where the gay friend gave the author blowjobs. The author later got a girlfriend, ended the arrangement, then after a breakup, resumed. Eventually, the author felt uncomfortable and stopped, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is straight but identifies as heteroflexible, which I think means he's open to some same-sex experiences, but not emotionally involved. The key points here are consent and clear communication. The author states that from the start, there was no expectation of emotional commitment or romantic involvement. The friend initiated the sexual contact, and the author accepted. \n\nThen, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows the author was respecting his relationship. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement, which was consensual. The author then decided to reciprocate, felt uncomfortable, and ended it, explaining his reasons politely. \n\nThe friend's reaction is being cold and distant, even after the author tried to reach out. The author is confused because others say he's leading the friend on, but he claims there was no emotional involvement or deception. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were deceptive or if there was an unspoken understanding that led to the friend feeling betrayed. Since the author was clear about his orientation and boundaries, and the friend was aware, maybe the issue is the friend's unmet emotional expectations despite the arrangement being purely physical. The author didn't misrepresent himself, so he might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that engaging in such a relationship, even consensually, can lead to emotional complications regardless of initial intentions. \n\nBut given the information, the author seems honest about his intentions and boundaries. The friend's reaction might be due to unacknowledged feelings or the nature of their friendship being affected by the physical relationship. The author's decision to stop and communicate clearly seems appropriate. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
