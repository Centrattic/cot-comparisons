I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex experiences but primarily straight. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They had this arrangement for a while, then stopped when the author had a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, then the author felt bad and ended it again. The friend became cold, leading to the author's confusion about whether he's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties seemed to agree to the arrangement initially. The author was honest about his sexuality, so the friend knew the relationship wasn't romantic. The author tried to maintain the friendship and even apologized when he felt uncomfortable continuing. The friend's reaction might stem from feeling used or emotionally hurt, even if there was no romantic intent. However, the author didn't force anything and tried to communicate his boundaries.\n\nThe author might have led the friend on by continuing the arrangement after the breakup, but since he clearly stated his position and ended it when he felt bad, it's a gray area. The friend's coldness is a reaction, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for ending the arrangement. The user's friend's behavior isn't justified, but the author's actions were consensual and he tried to address the issue respectfully. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
