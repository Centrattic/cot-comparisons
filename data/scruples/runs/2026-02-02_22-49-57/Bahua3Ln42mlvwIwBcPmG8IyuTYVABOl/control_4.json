I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nSo, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He had a gay friend with whom he engaged in oral sex. They did this a few times before the author got a girlfriend, then stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Then the author felt bad and reciprocated, but realized it wasn't for him and told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is being cold and distant, and others think the author led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries and consent. The initial arrangement was mutual and consensual, right? The author didn't push the friend into it. The friend offered, and the author accepted. But when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. Then after the breakup, they resumed. That seems like both parties agreed to it again. \n\nThen, the author reciprocated once, realized it wasn't his thing, and communicated that clearly. The friend's reaction is now being cold. The author tried to reconnect but was met with distance. The friends around say the author led him on. \n\nBut the author claims from the start it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. So the question is: does leading someone on mean not being clear about your intentions? The author didn't promise anything beyond the physical act. They had a mutual understanding. However, the friend might have developed feelings, even if the author didn't reciprocate. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If the author made it clear they're not interested beyond the physical, then maybe he's not at fault. But if the friend interpreted the acts as a sign of affection or a deeper connection, then the author might have inadvertently led him on. \n\nHowever, the author did stop the behavior after feeling bad and tried to maintain communication. The friend's coldness might be due to unreciprocated feelings or hurt pride, not necessarily the author's fault. The author isn't in a relationship with the friend, so having a physical arrangement without emotional attachment isn't inherently wrong if both sides are okay with it. \n\nBut when the author reciprocated and then stopped, maybe the friend felt rejected. The author's actions might have sent mixed signals. Even though he's straight, the act of reciprocating could have been confusing for the friend. \n\nIn terms of social norms, engaging in such a relationship with a friend could strain the friendship regardless of intentions. The author's actions are consensual, but the aftermath shows that the friend was affected emotionally. The author might not be in the wrong legally or morally, but socially, he might have caused harm unintentionally. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on whether clear boundaries were maintained. Since the author communicated his orientation and boundaries, and the friend was initially okay, but the situation became uncomfortable, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the act of reciprocating could have muddied the waters. But since the author tried to address it and the friend is now distant, it's more the friend's emotional response rather than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
