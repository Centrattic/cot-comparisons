I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. They started a sexual arrangement where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, they resumed. Later, the author reciprocated once but felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is clear about their orientation and the nature of the relationship. The friend is gay, so he's interested in the author in a sexual context. The author engages in this because they're single and horny, but when they get a girlfriend, it stops. After the breakup, they start again. The author then reciprocates once, feels bad, and ends the arrangement. The friend becomes distant.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as leading the friend on. Even though the author is straight, the friend is gay and might have had hopes of a romantic or more committed relationship. The author's actions, while clearly not romantic, could have sent mixed signals. The fact that the author engaged in sexual activity with the friend and then reciprocated might make the friend feel used or that his advances were not respected. The author's initial acceptance of the offer might have created an expectation the author didn't meet, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's explanation that they're not into the friend beyond physical intimacy might not align with the friend's perspective. The friend might have felt that there was a mutual understanding of a non-romantic arrangement, but when the author reciprocated, it led to confusion. The author then ends the arrangement, which could be seen as breaking the unspoken agreement, hence the friend's cold reaction.\n\nConsidering the responses from others in the sub, they said the author led him on, which is a common issue in such situations. Even if the author didn't intend to, their actions might have created an emotional or sexual expectation the friend had. The author might be in the wrong for not being more clear about the boundaries from the start and for not considering the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement. \n\nHowever, the author did try to communicate their feelings when they reciprocated and then stopped. The friend's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he's handling it poorly. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fact that the author engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend they knew was gay, even if it was purely physical, could be seen as problematic because it's a one-sided situation. The friend might have wanted more, and the author's actions, while not romantic, might have given false hope. So, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they might have led the friend on unintentionally, even if they were clear about their orientation.\n"
