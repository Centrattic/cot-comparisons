I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend and later when the girlfriend dumped him. After trying to reciprocate and feeling bad, he told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and the user is confused about his role in this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend offered oral sex, and they engaged in this arrangement. When the user had a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems okay. Then, when the user broke up, they resumed. The user then reciprocated but felt guilty and ended things. Now the friend is upset.\n\nThe key points are consent and communication. The user didn't force the friend; the friend initiated the acts. However, the user might have contributed to the friend's feelings of being used or unappreciated. The friend's reaction could be due to feeling rejected or that the user didn't value his feelings. Even if the user didn't intend to lead him on, the ongoing arrangement might have given false hope. Also, the user's attempt to reciprocate and then pulling back could have been confusing or hurtful. The friend's coldness suggests he felt hurt, which the user might be responsible for, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut the user was honest about his orientation and didn't pursue a relationship. The friend's feelings of being led on might stem from the physical intimacy without emotional connection. However, the user's actions could have created emotional dependency or unmet expectations. The user's main mistake was perhaps not considering the emotional impact on his friend, even if the acts were consensual. Ending things suddenly after reciprocation might have been abrupt. The user needs to respect the friend's feelings but also manage his own boundaries. It's a gray area, but given the friend's distress, the user's actions likely contributed to the problem, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
