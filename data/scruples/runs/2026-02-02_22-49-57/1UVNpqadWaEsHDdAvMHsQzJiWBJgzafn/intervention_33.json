Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between a boyfriend and girlfriend where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the girlfriend's period, and then says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The girlfriend responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. The girlfriend is confused because he had previously criticized vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with her period, which is a common issue and can be a sensitive topic. His follow-up comment about her wishing she had a penis could be seen as minimizing her experience or being condescending. The girlfriend's response is a straightforward statement of her discomfort with male genitalia, which is a personal opinion. She's not making a generalization about all men or attacking his identity; she's expressing her own perspective.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist is where things get tricky. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender, especially against women. If the girlfriend is making a blanket statement about male anatomy being uncomfortable, it might come across as stereotyping. However, she's not attacking his gender but expressing her own viewpoint based on observation. She also points out that he had criticized her anatomy, which adds context to her reaction.\n\nThe key here is whether her comments were sexist. If she's stating her personal opinion without generalizing all men or denigrating their gender, she's not being sexist. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling disrespected or having his anatomy criticized, but that's a different issue. The girlfriend's response was in reaction to his initial comment, which was also critical of her body. The situation seems like a mutual exchange of criticism about each other's anatomy, which can be a sensitive topic and lead to misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's response was a direct answer to his question and a personal opinion. She didn't make an attack on his gender but expressed her own experience. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced if his initial comments were more dismissive. Since both parties made comments that could be seen as critical of each other's anatomy, it's a matter of differing perspectives. The girlfriend isn't in the wrong for stating her truth, especially when the boyfriend had initiated the conversation with his own criticisms.\n"
