Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong when they expressed discomfort with male genitalia to their boyfriend.\n\nSo, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds by saying they don't want a penis because they find it uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then gets offended, calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a joke or a comment that trivializes the author's experience with periods. Then, when she gives a straightforward, honest response about her preferences, he takes offense. The key here is whether expressing a preference or opinion about one's body is sexist. \n\nSexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is stating her personal discomfort, not making a generalized negative statement about men or their bodies. She's sharing her own feelings, which is a valid right. The boyfriend, on the other hand, made a dismissive comment about her period, which could be seen as minimizing her experience. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist might be a deflection from his initial comment. He might be feeling defensive when his body is critiqued, but that doesn't justify calling her sexist. The author isn't making a judgment about all men, just her own preferences. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate. He storms off to think, which suggests he's not engaging in a constructive conversation. The author's response to his initial comment was a direct answer to his question, which was \"no, not really.\" She then elaborates on her reasons, which are based on personal observation (like scratching nuts) and discomfort. \n\nIn terms of communication, both parties could have handled it better. The author could have been more understanding of the boyfriend's perspective, but the boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive. The author's right to express her own feelings is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about defensiveness and not respecting her opinion. The answer should be B (No).\n"
