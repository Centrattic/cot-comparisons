Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then saying the author might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort and maintenance involved, and he gets offended, calling her sexist. The author is confused because he was previously making negative comments about vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the conversation. The boyfriend made a remark that trivializes the female experience (periods) by comparing it to something men don't have to deal with. The author responds honestly about her preferences regarding male anatomy, which is a personal opinion. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized about his body, but he was the one who initiated the comparison. \n\nSexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author's comments are about her personal comfort with her own body, not making a generalization about all men or women. She's expressing her view that male genitalia have aspects she finds inconvenient, which is a valid personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be a deflection because he feels his masculinity is being challenged, especially since he was already making a joke about periods, which can be seen as sexist in itself.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the boyfriend felt his body was being criticized, which can be sensitive. But since he started the conversation by comparing female experiences negatively, the author's response isn't the issue here. The key point is mutual respect. The author was honest about her feelings, which is her right. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced because he initiated the conversation with a potentially sexist comment. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's expressing her own perspective without making a sexist generalization. The boyfriend's reaction is more about defensiveness than a valid point. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
