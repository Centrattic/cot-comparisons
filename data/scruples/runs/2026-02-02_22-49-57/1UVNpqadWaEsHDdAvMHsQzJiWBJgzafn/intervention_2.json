Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said the person probably wishes they had a penis. The author responds that they don't want a penis because they find male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls it sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interactions. The boyfriend starts by making a derogatory comment about periods, which is a sensitive topic. Then he says something that implies that having a penis is better, maybe in a dismissive way towards the challenges of menstruation. The author is responding to his comment by explaining their discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend then gets upset, calls it sexist, and storms off.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship and whether the author's response was justified. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as minimizing the experience of having a period, which is a real issue for many people. The author is pushing back against that by highlighting the discomfort of male anatomy, which they observe in their partner. The boyfriend's reaction is to feel attacked and label the author's stance as sexist, which might be a deflection. \n\nSo, when the author says they don't want a penis because of the discomfort, they're making a personal preference based on their observations. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized or from a place of defensiveness because he initially made a derogatory remark. The author's response is a valid expression of their feelings, especially in response to his comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly invalidating. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it seems like the boyfriend started the conflict with his initial comments, which were dismissive. The author's response is a direct and honest reaction to that. The boyfriend calling the author sexist might be a misinterpretation or a way to avoid addressing the actual issue. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're responding to an initial provocation and expressing their perspective. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic because he's not engaging constructively and is instead taking offense without considering the author's point of view. The answer should be B.\n"
