Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe boyfriend comments that he's glad he doesn't have to deal with the user's period and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The user responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, says she's being sexist, mentions he scratches his nuts or rearranges his junk multiple times a day, which she finds annoying. He then storms off, upset, and she's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before.\n\nSo, the user is defending her body autonomy and expressing that she doesn't want male anatomy, which she finds inconvenient. The boyfriend is upset and labels her as sexist, which might be a case of him deflecting his own sexist comments. His initial remarks about not having to deal with periods and making a comment implying that having a penis is better could be the problematic part here. The user is just stating her perspective without making a generalized negative statement about all men or their bodies. She's talking about her own preferences and observations. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, but his initial comments were probably the root of the problem. He's upset about her not wanting a penis when he was making fun of her period. The user isn't wrong for stating her opinion, especially if he started the conversation with his own biased remarks. Labeling her as sexist is a stretch unless she made a generalization about all women or men, which she didn't. She's talking about her own body and preferences. \n\nSo, in this situation, the user isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend's reaction is more about deflection and possible defensiveness over his own sexist comments. The user is asserting her own body autonomy and preferences, which is valid. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
