Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between the author and her boyfriend about preferring not having a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and she responded by saying she doesn't want a penis because it's uncomfortable. He got offended and accused her of being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is stating her preferences based on observations of her boyfriend's habits. She's not making a broader statement about all men or all cisgender people, just expressing her own opinion. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was making a comment about periods, which can be a sensitive topic. His reaction might be out of proportion to her comment. \n\nThe key points here are about expressing personal preferences versus making sweeping judgments. The author is not saying that having a penis is inherently worse or that all men are uncomfortable. She's sharing her own feelings based on what she sees in her partner. The boyfriend's reaction of being \"weirdly offended\" and calling her sexist might stem from feeling that his body is being criticized, but her comments are about her own discomfort, not his worth or his body's validity.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods could be seen as dismissive of the challenges women face. The author's response is pointing out the physical aspects she finds uncomfortable about male genitalia, which is different from body shaming. It's more about personal preference rather than making a judgment about his body or his gender.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author was honest about her feelings, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate that he's not open to discussing such topics, but that's more about his response than her right to express her opinion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be an overreaction and possibly deflecting from his own initial comment about periods. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
