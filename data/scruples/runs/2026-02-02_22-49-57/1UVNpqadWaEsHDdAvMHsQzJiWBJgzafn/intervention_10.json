Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, leading to the boyfriend getting offended and calling it sexist. Now the author is confused because the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods earlier, but now is upset about her not wanting a penis.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's response is justified. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive or even belittling towards the author's experience with periods. He's making a joke that he's glad he doesn't have to deal with it, then implying that having a penis would be better. The author is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of having male genitalia, pointing out the practical inconveniences like having to deal with body parts that require regular attention. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to get offended and call her sexist. But the author isn't making a sweeping statement about all men or women; they're stating their personal preference and expressing discomfort based on observing her boyfriend's habits. So the author isn't being sexist here. The boyfriend's reaction seems hypocritical since he was criticizing her for having periods and now is upset about her not wanting his anatomy. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in a relationship and the validity of personal preferences. The author is expressing her own feelings without making a broader judgment. The boyfriend's response is defensive and dismissive, which is problematic. He's not engaging in a respectful dialogue but instead is getting upset and walking away. \n\nSo, given that the author is responding to a comment that was itself somewhat dismissive, and she's stating her own preferences without being derogatory, it seems like she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more of an issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
