Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't want a penis, explaining it's uncomfortable. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left. The author is confused because the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was wrong to express her dislike of having a penis. The boyfriend's initial comments were dismissive of her experience with periods and female anatomy. When he made the \"I bet you wish you had a dick\" comment, the author is voicing her genuine discomfort with male genitalia. She's stating her perspective based on her observations of his behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being called sexist seems misplaced. The author isn't making a general negative statement about men; she's explaining her personal preference and observations. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized, but he first criticized her body and periods. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is expressing her honest feelings without attacking him personally. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate, especially since he initiated the conversation with his own negative remarks. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
