Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a discussion between a couple about gender anatomy and preferences.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual criticism. The boyfriend initially trashes vaginas and periods, then the author expresses discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend reacts negatively to her honest opinion, even though he started the conversation with his own negative remarks. \n\nThe author's response is based on her personal observations and preferences. She mentions seeing her boyfriend attend to his genital area frequently, which she finds annoying. Her statement is about her own feelings, not a generalization or attack on men. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized, but the author's comments are about her own preferences, not a sexist stance. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments were dismissive of his partner's experience with periods, which could be seen as problematic. Then he gets upset when his partner shares her perspective. In this case, the author is defending her own views in response to his earlier comments. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. Considering that she's expressing her genuine feelings and the boyfriend was the one who brought up the topic in a derogatory way first, it seems like she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist and storming off might indicate that he's sensitive to criticism of male anatomy, but the author isn't making a broad sexist statement; she's stating her personal preference based on what she observes. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because she's responding honestly to his initial remarks without generalizing or making a sexist comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly hypocritical given his own earlier comments.\n"
