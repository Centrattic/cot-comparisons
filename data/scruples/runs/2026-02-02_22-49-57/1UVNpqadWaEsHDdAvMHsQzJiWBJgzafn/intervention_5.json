Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a conversation between a girlfriend and boyfriend where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and the girlfriend responds that she doesn't want to have a penis, finding male genitalia uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The boyfriend starts by making a derogatory comment about periods, which is a common topic of criticism. The girlfriend responds to his comment by expressing her own view on not wanting a penis, which she finds uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets upset and accuses her of sexism. \n\nIs the girlfriend in the wrong? The key here is whether her response is sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The girlfriend is stating a personal preference and observation about male genitalia, based on her experience of seeing the boyfriend's habits. She's not making a blanket statement about all men or asserting superiority of one gender over another. Instead, she's expressing her own comfort level and preferences. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about periods being a problem for women is itself a form of gender-based complaint. The girlfriend's response is a counterpoint based on her personal experience. The term \"sexist\" is being misapplied here because she's not discriminating against a gender; she's expressing a personal choice. \n\nMoreover, the boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. He was the one who initiated the conversation with a negative comment about women's biology, and her response is a valid personal opinion. The fact that he took offense and labeled her as sexist suggests he's deflecting his own sexist remark. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response is a legitimate expression of her preference and is not discriminatory. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism is unfounded in this context. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
