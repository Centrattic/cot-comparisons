Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, and then the author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis, citing discomfort and the idea of having to constantly attend to male genitalia. The boyfriend gets upset and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the author's experience with menstruation, which is a sensitive topic. His joke about her wishing she had a penis is likely a form of minimizing her discomfort. The author's response is a straightforward expression of her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia, which she finds uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction here is key. He accuses her of being sexist, which is a bit of a deflection. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender, but the author's comment is more about personal preference regarding anatomy. She's not making a generalized statement about all men or all women; she's expressing her own feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his masculinity or his body is being criticized. However, the author isn't criticizing him personally but rather the anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about taking it personally, possibly due to ego or insecurity. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend had just been trashing vaginas and periods, so his reaction seems inconsistent. If he's upset about her comment, but he was fine making a joke about periods, it's a bit hypocritical. The author's response is a legitimate reaction to his initial dismissive comment. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author is expressing her feelings in a direct but not aggressive way. The boyfriend's response is more about deflection and getting angry rather than engaging in a constructive conversation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her own perspective and boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues rather than the validity of her opinion. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
