Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods and implying the author might wish to have a penis. The author responds that she doesn't want male genitalia because it seems uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods and then suggested she might wish to have a penis. The author's response is based on her observations of the maintenance and discomfort associated with male genitalia. She points out specific examples like scratching or adjusting, which are normal but perhaps seen as trivialized in the argument.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of sexism. That's interesting because he initially made a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. The author's stance is about her preference, not a value judgment against men. She's stating her opinion based on her observations of his habits.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, she's expressing her honest feelings without attacking his masculinity or gender. She's responding to his initial comment, which was probably a jest but still dismissive. Her response is about her personal comfort, not a general statement against men or their bodies. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced because he initiated the conversation in a way that could be seen as trivializing her experience. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. She's not making a broad sexist statement but explaining her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be a deflection because he made the first controversial comment. The author's response is a valid expression of her preferences, so it's hard to see her as being in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
