Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" and explained that having male genitals seems uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as minimizing the experience of having a period. Then he made a joke or a statement implying that having a penis is better. The author's response is a straightforward rejection of that idea, giving reasons related to perceived discomfort and maintenance. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to become offended and accuse her of sexism. Now, sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. But in this case, the author is expressing a personal preference rather than making a general statement about all people. She's not saying that having male anatomy is worse for all women, just that for herself, she doesn't want it. \n\nThe boyfriend might be feeling that her comments are a put-down of male anatomy, but it's more about her personal preference. However, when he made his initial comments about periods and implying that having a vagina is worse, the author is pushing back against that. She's pointing out that male anatomy also has its own issues, like the need for maintenance. \n\nSo, is the author being sexist for not wanting to have a penis? Probably not, because she's expressing her own feelings without making a generalization about all people. It's a personal choice. On the other hand, the boyfriend's initial comments could be seen as sexist because he's dismissing the challenges of having a menstrual cycle, which is a real and common experience. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement was a personal opinion or a judgment against men. Since she's stating her own preference without generalizing, it's not necessarily sexist. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that his anatomy is being criticized, but she's just explaining her own perspective. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She was responding to her boyfriend's comments and expressing her own views. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially since he initially made a comment that could be seen as biased towards male anatomy. The answer is B."
