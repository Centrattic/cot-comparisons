Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is about a conversation between a boyfriend and girlfriend where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period, then says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable, and the boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response is justified. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience with periods. Then he flips it back to her by suggesting she might prefer having a penis. The author's response is about her personal discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out the maintenance (like scratching or adjusting) that she finds annoying. \n\nThe key here is whether expressing a personal preference or opinion about not wanting a penis is sexist. The boyfriend's reaction seems to imply that it's offensive, but the author is stating her own feelings, not making a generalization or derogatory statement about men. She's also pointing out the double standard where he was criticizing her body (vaginas and periods) but then gets upset when she critiques his body. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods and then shifting to making her feel bad for not wanting a penis come off as inconsistent. The author is responding to his comments with her own perspective, which is valid. There's no evidence she was making a broad sexist statement, just expressing her own views based on her observations. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his masculinity is being criticized, but the author isn't attacking his gender; she's talking about her own preferences and experiences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for stating her opinion. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about defensiveness and possible hypocrisy. The initial question is whether she's at fault, and since she's responding to his comments without malice or bias, the answer would be that she's not wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
