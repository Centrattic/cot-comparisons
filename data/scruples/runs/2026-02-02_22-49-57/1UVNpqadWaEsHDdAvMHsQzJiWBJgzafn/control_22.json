Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a girl) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded that she doesn't really want that, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and require constant attention, which he took as sexist. He got mad and left.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend made a joke or comment that's a bit dismissive of her experience with periods, then turned it into a jab about her not wanting a penis. She's honest about her feelings, which are based on her observations of his habits (like scratching, adjusting). She's expressing her personal preferences and her take on the downsides of male anatomy. He took offense, calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, is it okay for her to express her preferences? People have different body types and experiences. She's not making a generalization about all men, but stating her own feelings. If he was making a joke that trivialized her experience (periods) to make himself feel better, she's pushing back. Maybe he felt she was being negative about his body, hence \"sexist.\" But sexism would involve prejudice against a sex based on stereotypes or assumptions. She's expressing a personal opinion, not a broad, harmful stereotype. She's pointing out specific things she finds uncomfortable, which is valid. \n\nHe brought up the topic with a joke, and she responded to it. If he was offended by her honest answer, maybe he shouldn't have made the comment. Also, he was criticizing her for something that's a personal choice and then got upset when she didn't share his perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be the problem here. He made a dismissive comment about her period, then turned it into a joke about her body. She's just stating her truth. Unless there's a cultural or social norm that makes her comment offensive, which isn't clear here. It seems like a personal preference. So, she's not wrong for expressing that. He might be wrong for dismissing her experience with periods and then taking offense when she critiques his anatomy in the context of a joke.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's expressing her genuine feelings in response to his comment. He's the one who made the initial dismissive and possibly sexist comment, then got upset when she didn't conform to his expectations. Her response is a valid expression of her personal preferences.\n"
