Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended and called her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was reasonable. She was responding to his comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period. She then said she doesn't want a penis, explaining it's because of the discomfort and maintenance. He called her sexist, which is a key point here.\n\nIs her statement sexist? Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference and observation about her own body. She's not making a generalization that all women feel this way or putting down all men. She's stating her own perspective based on her experiences and observations of his body. So, it's more of a personal opinion rather than a sexist remark.\n\nHe was trashing vaginas and periods earlier, so his reaction might be hypocritical. If he was making negative comments about her experience (periods), then his reaction to her expressing her view on penises seems inconsistent. The author's response is a legitimate expression of her feelings towards her own body and his body, not a blanket judgment.\n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his body is being criticized, but the author isn't criticizing his worth as a person, just his anatomy. She's also pointing out the maintenance aspect, which is a factual observation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is asserting her own preferences and explaining her reasoning. Unless she made a harmful generalization, she's within her right to express her views. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist and getting angry might be an overreaction. The key here is whether his comments were part of a pattern of disrespectful behavior towards her, but the post doesn't indicate that. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response is a valid expression of her personal feelings and observations. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to defensiveness or misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
