Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. From the context, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't want male genitalia, finding them uncomfortable. He was offended and called her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend started by making a derogatory comment about periods, which is a sensitive topic. Then he made a joke about her wishing to have a penis. The author's response is a straightforward expression of her feelings about male anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he was the one initiating the conversation with potentially sexist remarks. \n\nThe author isn't making a blanket statement about all men or all penises, just expressing her personal discomfort based on observing her boyfriend's habits. The boyfriend's offense might stem from the comment being a critique of male anatomy, which he perceives as an attack on his masculinity. However, the initial joke he made was likely more harmful as it trivialized a natural bodily function and implied that having a penis is better because it avoids menstruation.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and the context of the conversation. The author had the right to express her discomfort, especially after he brought up the topic in a dismissive way. The boyfriend's reaction, getting angry and calling her sexist, seems to deflect from his own initial comments. In relationships, open communication is important, and the author's response is a valid expression of her perspective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
