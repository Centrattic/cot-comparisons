Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the boyfriend making a comment about the author not having a penis and her responding that she doesn't want one, explaining it's uncomfortable. He got offended and called her sexist. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was making a flippant remark about periods and then asked if she wished she had a penis. Her response was a straightforward expression of her discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out the maintenance he does. He took it as sexist, but that's confusing because he was the one making a derogatory comment about periods. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was sexist. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. She's expressing a personal preference, not making a generalization or judgment about all men or their worth. Her reasoning is based on her own observations of discomfort. The boyfriend's comment about periods is devaluing a natural bodily function, which is itself problematic. Then he criticizes her for not wanting a part of his anatomy, which might be a defense of his own body but could be seen as dismissing her valid concerns. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend was the first to make a light-hearted jab, so her responding with her own opinion is a normal reaction. He might be feeling attacked because his masculinity or his body is being discussed, but that doesn't mean her statement is wrong. The fact that he was upset by her honest feedback but didn't apologize for his initial comment suggests he's not holding up his end here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to a comment with her personal feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own insecurities or defensiveness rather than a valid point about sexism. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
