Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation.\n\nSo, the scenario is the author's boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then joked that she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't really want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because her boyfriend previously made negative comments about vaginas and periods, but she's the one in the wrong now?\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably a bit dismissive of her experience with periods and then made a joke implying that having a penis would be better, maybe implying that she's missing out. The author's response is her honest opinion that she finds male genitalia inconvenient. The boyfriend reacts negatively, calling her sexist for not wanting a penis. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend's initial comment was probably not respectful. He was making a joke that minimized her experience with periods. Then, when she states her opinion, he's offended. But the author is expressing her personal preferences, which is her right. Saying that she finds male genitalia uncomfortable isn't inherently sexist. Sexism would be making a judgment about someone's worth based on their gender. The author is talking about her own physical preferences, not making a broad statement about men or women.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. He was making fun of her body's natural processes, and when she points out that his gender's experiences have their own issues, he takes offense. It seems like he's being defensive and inconsistent. If he was okay making a joke about her period, why is she wrong for pointing out the other side? The key here is that the author isn't making a value judgment about men or women; she's sharing her personal discomfort with certain body parts. The boyfriend's claim of sexism might be a misinterpretation. His reaction is more about being insulted rather than a legitimate concern about sexism.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to his initial comment and stating her own perspective. The boyfriend's behavior, on the other hand, seems to be the issue here\u2014making dismissive remarks about her period and then getting upset when she points out the other side of the coin.\n"
