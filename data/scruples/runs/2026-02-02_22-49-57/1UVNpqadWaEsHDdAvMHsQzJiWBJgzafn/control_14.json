Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets upset, says she's being sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend was making a joke or a comment that could be seen as trivializing the author's experience with menstruation. He's implying that having a penis is better because it avoids periods. The author is pushing back against that by saying she doesn't want the parts that come with his privileges, like not having to deal with periods. She's pointing out the downsides of male anatomy, which he's used to and maybe takes for granted.\n\nThe boyfriend calls her sexist, but his original comment could be seen as sexist because he's making a gendered assumption and dismissing the author's experience. The author is responding to his comment, pointing out the discomforts he might not consider. She's not making a generalization about all men or women, just her own perspective.\n\nSo, the author is defending her own viewpoint in response to his comment. It seems like she's not being sexist here; she's highlighting aspects that he might not consider. The boyfriend's reaction might be because he's used to his own body and doesn't see his anatomy as problematic, so criticism feels personal. But the author isn't wrong for expressing her discomfort. She's addressing his original sexist remark by pointing out the other side. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
