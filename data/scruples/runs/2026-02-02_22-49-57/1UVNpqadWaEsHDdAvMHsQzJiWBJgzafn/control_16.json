Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a conversation between a girlfriend and boyfriend regarding gender anatomy. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward, mentioning things like needing to scratch or adjust them. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left to think about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong in her response. The key points here are about expressing a personal preference and the boyfriend's reaction. The author is stating her opinion that having a penis is uncomfortable, based on her observations of her boyfriend's habits. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to have taken offense, interpreting her comments as sexist. The author also points out that he was previously making negative comments about vaginas and periods, which he's now accepting.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider mutual respect in a relationship. The author is expressing her genuine feelings and observations, which are valid personal opinions. The fact that he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier could be relevant. If he was comfortable criticizing female anatomy, then the author's response about male anatomy might be seen as a reciprocal viewpoint. However, the boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling targeted or from a different perspective on gender roles.\n\nSexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author isn't making a generalized negative statement about all men or male anatomy based on stereotypes, but rather sharing her personal discomfort. So, calling her sexist might be a mischaracterization of her stance. On the other hand, if she were making broad, demeaning statements about all men, that could be different. But here, it's her personal view.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of storming off and making her think about why his anatomy is an issue might be an overreaction. The author isn't suggesting that all men are uncomfortable or that having a penis is inherently worse, just her own opinion. It's about personal preference. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her view, especially since the boyfriend was also making disparaging remarks about female anatomy. The situation seems to be a case of mutual criticism, but the boyfriend's taking offense might be misplaced. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
