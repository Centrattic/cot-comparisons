Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation starts with her boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and implying she might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want a penis, explaining it's because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment trivializing her menstrual experience. Then when she states her opinion about not wanting a penis, he reacts negatively, calling her sexist. The key here is whether her statement is sexist or if he's overreacting.\n\nSexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference based on her observations and comfort. She's not making a generalized negative statement about men as a whole but explaining why she finds male anatomy inconvenient. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was critical of her experience with periods, which is a form of minimizing her experience, which could be seen as sexist himself.\n\nThe author's response is a critique of the physical aspects of male anatomy, not a judgment of men as a gender. The boyfriend's reaction seems to conflate personal anatomy critique with sexism, which might be a misunderstanding. He might be taking offense to her statement not realizing it's about anatomy rather than gender roles.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend was the one who started the conversation by trashing periods and implying that having a penis is better. The author is just responding to his comment. So the initial tone of the conversation was dismissive towards her experience, and her response is a counterpoint based on her own observations.\n\nIn terms of consent and respect in a relationship, both partners should feel they can express their views without being shamed. However, labeling someone as sexist without understanding their point might be an overreaction. The author didn't make a sexist comment; she made a personal preference statement. The boyfriend's reaction could be projecting his own insensitivity.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a personal viewpoint in response to his dismissive remarks. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced, and he might be conflating anatomical critique with gender-based prejudice. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
