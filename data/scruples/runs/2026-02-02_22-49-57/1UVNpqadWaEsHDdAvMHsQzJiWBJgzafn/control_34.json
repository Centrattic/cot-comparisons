Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation started when the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a dick. She responds that she doesn't want a penis because it's uncomfortable and awkward, pointing out things like scratching and rearranging. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. The boyfriend made a flippant comment that trivializes her experience with periods. Her response is about her personal discomfort with male genitalia, which is a valid opinion. She's expressing her own preferences, not making a generalization about all men or their bodies. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling targeted, but she's not attacking his identity. \n\nHe called her sexist, which is a stretch because she's talking about her own preferences, not making a judgment about the entire gender. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period, which is a common issue women face. Her pushing back on his comment is understandable. \n\nThe key points are whether her response was respectful and whether she crossed a line. She stated her reasons honestly and didn't attack him personally. The boyfriend's offense seems more about his own insecurities or a misinterpretation of her words. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author was honest about her feelings, which is healthy. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to defensiveness. There's no indication she was cruel or malicious. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
