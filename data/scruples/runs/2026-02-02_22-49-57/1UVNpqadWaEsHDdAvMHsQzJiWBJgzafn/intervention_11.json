Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a dick. She responded that she doesn't want a penis because of how uncomfortable and awkward it seems, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her pants. He got offended and called her sexist, then left.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. First, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment about her period, which is a sensitive topic for many. Then he made a joke about her wishing she had a penis. His initial comment could be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience with menstruation. The author's response is about her personal feelings towards male anatomy, which she finds uncomfortable. She's expressing her genuine feelings, not making a generalization about all men or the opposite gender. \n\nThe boyfriend accused her of being sexist, which might be a misunderstanding. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender, often in a broader context. Here, she's talking about her personal preference and observations about his anatomy. She's not making a judgment about the value of men or women, just her own comfort. His reaction might stem from feeling attacked, but her comments were a response to his initial joke. \n\nThe boyfriend then storms off, indicating he's hurt or offended. However, his initial remarks were arguably more problematic. He made a comment about periods, which are a natural bodily function, in a way that could be seen as trivializing her experience. Then he made a joke about her wishing for a penis, which could be seen as dismissive. The author's response is about her own body image and comfort, which is valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, neither side is entirely without fault, but the author's statement is a personal opinion based on her observations. She's not attacking his gender or making a blanket statement. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about the personal sting of his anatomy being criticized rather than a valid point about sexism. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's expressing her feelings honestly in response to his initial comments. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, as he initiated the conversation with potentially hurtful remarks. The key here is that the author's response is her own perspective and not a prejudiced view against men. So the answer should be B.\n"
