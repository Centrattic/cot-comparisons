Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation starts with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and says she might wish she had a dick. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis, explaining it's because of the discomfort and maintenance. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, first, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive and maybe a bit dismissive of her experience with periods. Then the author gives her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia, citing discomfort. He takes offense, which feels a bit defensive. The key here is whether expressing a personal preference is sexist. The author isn't making a generalization about all men or women, just stating her own view. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on feeling criticized, but is that a valid reason to get upset?\n\nThe boyfriend's original comments about trashing vaginas and periods might have been the start of the problem. If he was making her period seem negative, then her pushing back about his anatomy seems like a fair response. The term \"sexist\" is usually about prejudice based on gender. The author isn't making a blanket statement about gender roles but expressing her personal preference. Unless she's making a derogatory generalization, which she doesn't seem to be, she's not being sexist. So, the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. The author is in her right to express her opinion without being called sexist. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
