Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded \"no, not really,\" explaining she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend got upset, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nSo, is the author being sexist? Or is the boyfriend overreacting? Let me think. The boyfriend's initial comment seems to be making a comparison that might trivialize the experience of having a period. Then the author is honest about her feelings towards male anatomy. She's not saying that having a penis is bad in a general sense, just that she personally finds it uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend took offense, calling her sexist. But sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author's statement is more about personal preference rather than making a judgment about gender roles or capabilities. She's expressing her own view on her body, not devaluing men or women. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was making a comment that could be seen as minimizing the challenges of having a period, which is a real and common experience for many women. He might be contributing to a stereotype that women's bodies are inconvenient, while his own anatomy is portrayed as better. \n\nSo, the author's response is a straightforward answer to his question. She's not attacking him but stating her personal feelings. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to feeling disrespected or not taken seriously, but his initial comment might have been the start of the conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her honest opinion. The boyfriend might have taken it personally because it challenged his assumptions or ego. It's a communication issue rather than a clear case of wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
