Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable, mentioning things like having to deal with genital hair, nutsack, etc. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response is valid. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of menstruation, which is a common critique. Then he makes a joke about the author wanting a penis, which might be trying to trivialize her experience. The author's response is about her personal preferences regarding male anatomy. She's stating her opinion that having a penis would be uncomfortable, based on observations of her boyfriend's habits. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to call her sexist. Is that fair? Sexism typically involves prejudice against someone based on their sex. The author is expressing a personal preference, not making a generalization about all men or women. She's talking about her own feelings towards male anatomy, not making derogatory statements about men as a gender. So calling her sexist might be a mischaracterization.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods and wishing he had a penis could be seen as minimizing her experience. The author is pushing back against that by stating her own perspective. The conflict arises because the boyfriend perceives her statement as sexist, but she's actually expressing a personal choice and observation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems she's responding to his comments with her own viewpoint, which is valid. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized about his body or his gender, but her comments are about her own preferences, not his worth. So, she's not being sexist. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
