  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after expressing their discomfort about not wanting a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, then joked about the author wishing they had a penis. She responded negatively, explaining the discomfort of male genitalia, and he got offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive and possibly disrespectful towards his partner's experience with periods. He then makes a joke implying that having a penis is better, which the author challenges by stating her reasons. She's not making a judgment about gender roles but expressing her personal comfort and observations about genitalia. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems hypersensitive. The author's response is based on her own experience and observations, such as the need to attend to genitalia frequently. It's a matter of personal preference and comfort, not a sexist statement. The boyfriend's argument that she's being sexist might stem from a misunderstanding, thinking she's devaluing male anatomy, but she's actually just stating her own preferences without generalizing negatively about men as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend had just trashed vaginas and periods, which is a more problematic stance. The author's response isn't about gender equality but about her own physical preferences. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Her response is valid and doesn't cross into sexist territory. The boyfriend's reaction is unwarranted and shows a lack of empathy and openness to his partner's perspective.\n"
