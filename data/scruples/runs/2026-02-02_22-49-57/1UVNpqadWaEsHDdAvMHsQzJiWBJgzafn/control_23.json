Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their response to their boyfriend's comment. The boyfriend made a joke about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want a penis because they find male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then gets offended and calls her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as dismissive of the author's experience with periods. He's making a comparison between his experience as a male and hers. The author's response is about her personal preference regarding body parts, which she finds inconvenient. \n\nIs the author being sexist? The boyfriend is saying he's glad he doesn't have periods and implies that having a penis is better. The author is countering that she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort involved. She's pointing out the maintenance and potential discomfort associated with male genitalia. That seems like a valid personal opinion, not necessarily sexist. Sexism would involve prejudice against a sex. Here, the author is expressing a preference based on her observations and comfort, not devaluing a gender.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be defensiveness because his own body is being critiqued. He might feel that his experience is being dismissed or that he's being told his body is inferior. But the author's point isn't about the value of men versus women, but about her own preferences regarding body parts. \n\nHe says he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier. If he's making negative comments about female biology and then gets upset when his male counterpart is critiqued, that could be a double standard. The author is responding to his initial dismissal by pointing out the other side. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? The boyfriend's comment was probably inappropriate, and the author's response was a legitimate reaction to his remarks. She's not making a blanket statement about all men or their worth, just her own feelings about body parts. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, as the author isn't attacking his gender but rather countering his dismissive comment. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
