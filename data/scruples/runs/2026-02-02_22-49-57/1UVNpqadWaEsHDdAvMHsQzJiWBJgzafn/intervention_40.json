Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a woman (assuming from context) in a relationship with a boyfriend. During her period, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with it, and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't really want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left to let her think about it. Now the author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe author's main points: She's responding to her boyfriend's initial comment, which was dismissive of her period. He made a joke/remark implying that having a vagina and periods is a bad thing, hence his sarcastic \"glad he didn't have to deal with that.\" She then clarifies that she doesn't want a penis because of the physical discomfort she observes in her boyfriend, like scratching or adjusting. He took offense, called her sexist, and left.\n\nSo, the key here is whether her response was inappropriate. Let's consider the dynamics. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with menstruation. Then he made a joke about her wishing she had a penis, which is a common trope in which women are told they'd prefer being male to avoid female anatomy's \"inconveniences.\" The author's response is about her actual preferences and discomfort with male genitalia, not making a generalization about all men or women.\n\nThe boyfriend called her sexist, which is interesting. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If she were making a general statement that all men's genitalia are uncomfortable, that might be more sexist, but she's talking about her own perspective. She points out specific behaviors she observes in her boyfriend, which could be her way of expressing her own view that having those parts is inconvenient. It's a personal preference, not an attack on his masculinity or a generalization about all men. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's initial comment was likely condescending or dismissive towards her experience with periods. The author is pushing back against his implication that being a woman is worse because of menstruation, by pointing out that having a penis has its own issues. Her response is a form of retort, challenging his assumption. \n\nIs it fair for her to express her discomfort with male genitalia? Yes, because she's sharing her personal experience and opinion. However, the boyfriend might feel that she's generalizing or being critical of his body, which can be hurtful. But in this case, she's talking about her own perspective, not attacking him directly. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of storming off and accusing her of sexism seems more about defensiveness than a valid concern. He started the conversation with a comment that could be seen as belittling her experience. The author is responding to that, not making a broad sexist statement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend initiated the problematic comments first. Her response is a legitimate expression of her views, and it's not sexist to state that you don't want certain body parts if you find them uncomfortable. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism is misplaced here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
