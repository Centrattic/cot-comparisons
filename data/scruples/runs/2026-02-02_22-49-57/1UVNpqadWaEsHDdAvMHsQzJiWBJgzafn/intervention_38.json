Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, mentioning things like having to scratch or adjust the genitalia. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the author's experience with menstruation and made a jab about having a penis. The author's response is about their personal preference and observations. They're not making a generalization about all people or attacking his gender. Instead, they're expressing a personal discomfort with certain aspects of male genitalia.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. He was already trashing vaginas and periods earlier, so his offense at the author's response is inconsistent. The author is stating their truth about their own feelings, which is valid. The boyfriend's claim of sexism might stem from feeling criticized, but the author isn't making a judgment about the value of being male; she's just expressing a preference. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
