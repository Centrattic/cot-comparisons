Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation during her period where her boyfriend makes a comment about not having to deal with it, then says he thinks she might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't and explains why, leading to him getting offended and calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. She's expressing her preference, which is a personal choice. She's not making a generalization about men but stating her own feelings. Her reasons are based on observations about male genital maintenance, which she finds uncomfortable. This seems to be a personal opinion rather than a sexist statement. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend initiated the conversation by trashing periods and implying she might prefer being male. His reaction to her honest answer as sexist is a bit concerning. He might be taking her personal opinion as a criticism of his anatomy, which isn't necessarily the case. She's not making a broad statement about men but explaining her own perspective. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author is not in the wrong. She's responding to his initial comment with her own views. His reaction seems hypersensitive, especially since he brought up the topic first. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
