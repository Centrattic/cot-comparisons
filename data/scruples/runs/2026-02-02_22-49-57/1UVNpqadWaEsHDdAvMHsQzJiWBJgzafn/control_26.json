  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that they don't want a penis, finding male genitals uncomfortable. The boyfriend got offended, called them sexist, and stormed off. The author is confused because the boyfriend was okay with trashing vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods and then about the author's body. The author is expressing their preference and discomfort with male genitalia, which is a personal opinion. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be a deflection or invalidation of the author's feelings. The author is standing up for themselves after the boyfriend's initial comments. \n\nIs the author being sexist? It doesn't seem like it. They're stating their own preferences and discomfort, not making a broad negative judgment about men or male anatomy. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized, but the author is just expressing their perspective. The boyfriend's earlier comments about periods and vaginas being negative were not called out as sexist, but his reaction to the author's response is. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy here.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're responding to the boyfriend's comments and expressing their own feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
