Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and joked about her wishing she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend made a flippant comment about not having to deal with her period, which is a common issue where men often minimize or belittle menstruation. Then he says she might wish she had a penis, implying that being female is worse. She's pointing out that male genitalia have their own issues, like discomfort and maintenance (scratching, adjusting). \n\nThe key here is whether her response is sexist. She's not making a generalization about all men or all women, but rather sharing her personal perspective based on observation. She's responding to his sexist comment by highlighting the downsides of male anatomy, which could be seen as a fair counterpoint. The boyfriend gets upset because his anatomy is being criticized, but he initiated the conversation with his own sexist remark.\n\nIs her response sexist? She's not making a broad negative statement about men as a whole. She's using his own argument against him by pointing out the discomforts of male genitalia. Her reasoning is based on her observations of his behavior. Since he started the conversation with a sexist joke, her response seems like a reasonable pushback against his point. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling attacked, but the initial comment was the catalyst. She's not in the wrong because she's responding to his statement and expressing her own view without generalizing. The situation seems more like a clash of differing perspectives, with the boyfriend's behavior being more problematic due to his initial sexist comment and then getting upset when she challenges it.\n"
