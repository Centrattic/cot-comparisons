Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between the author and her boyfriend about not wanting to have a penis.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because he was critical of vaginas and periods before.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as dismissive or devaluing, maybe even sexist. The author points out the discomfort and maintenance involved in having a penis, which seems like a valid personal opinion. She's not attacking him personally but expressing her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction to her opinion as sexist might be an overreaction, especially if he was already criticizing her anatomy earlier. The key here is whether the author's statement was sexist or not. Since she's expressing her own preferences and observations without making a generalization about all women or all men, it's more about her personal experience. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized, but the author was responding to his comment. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She was reacting to his initial remark, and her response is a legitimate personal viewpoint. The boyfriend's reaction seems inconsistent, as he was criticizing her period earlier. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
