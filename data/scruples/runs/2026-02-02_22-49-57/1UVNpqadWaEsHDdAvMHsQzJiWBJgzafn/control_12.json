Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she didn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable. He got offended and called her sexist. She argues that he was trashing vaginas and periods before she said that.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual criticism. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissing or mocking periods. The author's response is about her discomfort with male genitalia. The boyfriend then takes offense, labeling her as sexist. The question is whether her response was inappropriate.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, discussing the physical aspects and discomforts of different body parts can be seen as valid, especially if it's about bodily autonomy and personal preference. The author isn't making a value judgment about male anatomy in a derogatory way but expressing her own feelings about it. The boyfriend's initial comment about periods being a downside is likely to be seen as dismissive of women's experiences. The author's response is a counterpoint to his remark, highlighting the discomforts of male anatomy, which she observes in him.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist might stem from him perceiving her comments as a personal attack, but if he was making a joke or teasing about not wanting periods, the author's response is a balanced critique. The fact that he was previously making negative comments about periods could mean that the author's response is part of a mutual exchange of criticisms, not just her being sexist.\n\nIt's possible that the boyfriend feels his anatomy is being criticized, but the author is responding to his earlier jab. The issue here is whether expressing a preference for not having a certain anatomy is sexist. Since the author isn't making a broad generalization about all men or their worth, but rather discussing her own feelings about anatomy, it's more about personal preference rather than sexism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't being sexist; she's responding to his comments and expressing her own observations. The boyfriend's reaction seems defensive, especially since he started the conversation by making a potentially sexist comment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
