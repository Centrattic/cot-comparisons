Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and then joked that she might wish she had a penis. She responded negatively, explaining she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. He took offense, called her sexist, and got mad.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend started the conversation by making a flippant comment about not having to deal with periods, then made a sarcastic remark about her wishing she had a penis. That's already problematic because he's dismissing her experience with periods. Then the author is honest about her feelings towards male anatomy, which she finds inconvenient. The boyfriend gets upset and labels her as sexist. \n\nNow, sexism usually involves prejudice against someone based on their gender. The author isn't making a generalization about all men or women; she's expressing her personal preference and observations. She's talking about her own comfort and experiences, not making a broader judgment about genders. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness rather than understanding. He even previously mocked her about periods, which is a more serious issue.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend initiated with a dismissive and possibly sexist comment about periods. The author responded truthfully to his question. Her comments are based on her own perspective, not a sexist viewpoint. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
