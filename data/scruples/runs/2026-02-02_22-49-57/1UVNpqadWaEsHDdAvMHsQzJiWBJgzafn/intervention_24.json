Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend discussing bodily functions and preferences.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked that she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because it's uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship and the appropriateness of their reactions. The boyfriend initially made a joke that could be seen as dismissive of her experience with periods. The author's response is based on her personal preferences and observations about male genitalia, which she finds inconvenient. \n\nIs the author being sexist by not wanting a penis? Sexism involves prejudice against someone based on their sex. The author is expressing her own preference, not making a generalized negative statement about men. She's stating her discomfort with male anatomy, which is a personal opinion. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, especially after he made a joke about her period. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might be about the criticism of his body or the perceived lack of appreciation for his anatomy. However, the author is not attacking his masculinity or making harmful generalizations. She's expressing her own feelings, which are valid. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate openly, even if topics are sensitive. The boyfriend's initial comment was likely flippant, which could have been hurtful. The author's response is a direct but honest reaction to his comment. The boyfriend's taking offense might be an overreaction, especially since he initiated the conversation with a joke about her period, which isn't respectful either.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own feelings without attacking him, while the boyfriend's behavior included the initial dismissive comment and then getting upset at her honest response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
