Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple having a conversation where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't, giving reasons about discomfort and maintenance. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods, which are a natural part of the female body. His comment about wishing to have a penis could be seen as minimizing the challenges women face, like menstruation. The author's response is about the physical discomfort and maintenance of male genitalia, which is a valid point. She's pointing out that having different biology has its own inconveniences.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction is key here. He's offended by her statement and calls her sexist. But the author's comments are based on observations and experiences, not a generalization or insult towards men. She's not saying all men are uncomfortable; she's talking about her own perspective. If the boyfriend is getting upset about her honest opinion, that might indicate an issue with his own sensitivity. Also, he previously made a derogatory comment about vaginas and periods, which the author is now addressing. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's comments are a response to his initial remark. She's expressing her personal feelings and observations, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he might be more sensitive about his own gender's issues than he is about hers. The fact that he called her sexist without understanding her reasoning could mean he's not engaging in a healthy dialogue. \n\nIn terms of sexism, the author isn't making a broad statement about all men. She's discussing her own perspective on male anatomy. So, she's not being sexist here. The boyfriend's initial comment about periods being something to be glad he doesn't have to deal with is more problematic because it trivializes a natural bodily function. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to a comment that was dismissive of her experience and pointing out the other side of the coin. The boyfriend's reaction is misplaced because he's taking her honest feedback as an attack rather than a valid discussion point.\n"
