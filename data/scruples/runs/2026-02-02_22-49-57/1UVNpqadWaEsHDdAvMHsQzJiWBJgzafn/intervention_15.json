Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with having male genitalia, which leads to an argument with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and wished he had a penis. The author responded that she doesn't really want a penis, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then got offended, called her sexist, and left. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to express her honest feelings and the boyfriend's reaction. The author is stating her preferences based on her observations, which seems like a valid personal opinion. The boyfriend's comment about trashing vaginas and periods was the initial provocation. The author is responding to his statement, which was dismissive of her experience. \n\nI should also consider if the author's comments were sexist. She's making a personal choice based on her observations of his habits, not making a broad judgment against all men or their bodies. Her comments are about her own preferences, not a generalized negative view of male genitalia. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. If he felt called out for his earlier comments about periods and vaginas, he might be deflecting by accusing her of sexism. The author is defending her own perspective, which is a legitimate right. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's articulating her feelings, and the boyfriend's offense seems more about his own defensiveness rather than a valid response to sexism.\n"
