Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then implying the author might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't want male genitalia because they seem uncomfortable and messy, and the boyfriend gets upset, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as minimizing the experience of having periods, which is a natural biological process. Then he made a joke about the author possibly wishing she had a penis, which she took as a serious question. Her response about not wanting male genitalia is based on her observations of his own behavior, like scratching or adjusting, which she finds annoying. \n\nThe boyfriend then reacts with anger, saying she's sexist. This is where things get tricky. The author is expressing a personal preference based on her own observations and comfort. It's important to note that she isn't making a general statement about all people but is expressing her own feelings in the relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be taking her personal opinion as an attack on his gender, which might be a misunderstanding. He might be conflating her personal preference with a broader sexist viewpoint. However, the author is simply stating her own boundaries and preferences in their relationship. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's initial comment about periods could be seen as dismissive or trivializing. The author's response is a legitimate expression of her feelings, and it's her right to communicate her boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction to her response as sexist might be an overreaction, especially since she's not making a generalization about all people with vaginas. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's responding to a comment that was likely inappropriate herself, and her response is a personal preference in a relationship context. The boyfriend's offense might stem from a misunderstanding or defensiveness. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
