Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend comments on not having to deal with periods and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" and explains that having male genitals seems uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, says she's being sexist, and storms off. The author argues that the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods moments before.\n\nNow, considering the context. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about periods and then made a remark implying that having a vagina is worse than having a penis. The author's response is a valid personal opinion about her body. She's expressing discomfort with male genitalia, which is her personal preference. The boyfriend interpreting this as sexism seems like a misunderstanding. The user is asking if the author is wrong for expressing her honest opinion here.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, both partners might be reacting from their own perspectives. The boyfriend might feel that by not wanting to have a penis, the author is devaluing men's bodies, hence calling it sexist. But the author is just stating her personal discomfort, not making a broad judgment. The boyfriend's initial comments about periods and wishing he had a penis set the tone for the conversation. The author isn't in the wrong for responding honestly to his comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be projection or defensiveness. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
