Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then the author responding to a joke about wanting a penis. The author explains her reasons for not wanting a penis, leading to the boyfriend feeling offended and calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as trivializing the experience of dealing with periods, which is a valid issue. The author then responds to his joke, which he took offensively. She gives her reasoning based on her observations of him taking care of his genitalia. The boyfriend's reaction is to storm off, implying that he's upset. The author is confused because he was making a joke about periods but gets upset when she rejects the idea of having a penis.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. She was reacting to a joke that she found dismissive of her experience. She's explaining her own preferences and pointing out the discomforts associated with having male genitalia, which is a legitimate point. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he was making the joke first. The author isn't making a broad statement about all men but is responding to his specific comment. The boyfriend's claim of sexism is questionable because the author is expressing her personal preferences, not making a generalization about all men.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author is justifying her stance based on her observations and experiences. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced, especially since he initiated the conversation with a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
