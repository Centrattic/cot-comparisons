Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, saying she was being sexist. The boyfriend made a comment about periods and wished he had a penis, then when she expressed discomfort with male genitalia, he was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The boyfriend made a sexist remark by trashing periods and implying having a penis is better. The author responded honestly about her feelings towards male anatomy. He took offense, but he initially started with a sexist comment. The author's response is about her personal preferences, not a generalization against men. He accused her of sexism, but she's not making a claim about all men, just her own preferences.\n\nThe key points are mutual disrespect, but the author was responding to his initial comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems hypersensitive and invalidating. The author is not wrong for expressing her honest feelings. So the answer should be B.\n"
