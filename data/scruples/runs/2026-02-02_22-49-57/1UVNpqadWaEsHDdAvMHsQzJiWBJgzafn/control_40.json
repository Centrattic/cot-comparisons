Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a disagreement between a girlfriend and boyfriend about not wanting to have a penis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The girlfriend responded that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, like having \"meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches.\" He got offended and called her sexist, then left. \n\nSo, the core issue is about the girlfriend expressing her discomfort with male genitalia, and the boyfriend taking it as an insult or sexist. The girlfriend is confused because he was critical of female genitalia and periods before. \n\nI should consider the context. The initial comment from the boyfriend might be dismissive of her experience (periods), which is not okay. But when she counters with her own perspective, he reacts negatively. The girlfriend's response is her personal opinion about her own body preferences. She's not making a general statement about all women, but her own feelings. \n\nIs her statement sexist? Sexism is prejudice based on someone's sex, especially against women. Here, she's not expressing prejudice against men or women. She's stating her own preference, which is that she doesn't want male genitalia. That's not inherently sexist; it's about personal comfort and choice. \n\nThe boyfriend, on the other hand, was making a remark that could be seen as minimizing her experience (periods) and implying that having a penis is better. His reaction to her counterpoint seems disproportionate. He got offended and left, which might be an overreaction. Also, he called her sexist, which might be deflecting from his own initial disrespectful comment.\n\nSo, the girlfriend was responding to the boyfriend's trash talk about female bodies by asserting her own viewpoint. Her statement is a personal choice, not a judgment against men. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his defensiveness and not being able to handle criticism of his gender's experiences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend is not in the wrong because she's expressing her own feelings. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic\u2014both his initial comment and his reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
