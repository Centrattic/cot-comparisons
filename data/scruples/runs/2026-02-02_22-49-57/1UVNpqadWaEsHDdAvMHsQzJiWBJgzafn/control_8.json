Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple arguing over the boyfriend's comment and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a joke about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't really want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissive of her experience with periods. Then the author is honest about her feelings towards not wanting a penis. His reaction is to call her sexist and get angry. \n\nThe key points here are mutual disrespect. The boyfriend's initial comment trivializes her monthly discomfort, which is a valid issue. The author's response is a personal opinion about her body, which is her right. But he takes offense, maybe because he feels she's making a judgment about his anatomy. However, he started by making a joke that could be hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether expressing a personal preference about one's own body is wrong. The author isn't attacking his gender or making a generalization, just stating her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about taking offense to criticism of male anatomy, even if it's just a personal opinion. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods before this, so there's a history of him making negative comments. The author is responding to his comment, which might be a defense of her own experience. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is expressing her genuine feelings and observations. It's a matter of personal preference and body autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction is more about defensiveness over his anatomy being criticized, even if it's a personal opinion. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and her own experiences. The boyfriend's comments were the initial problem, and his reaction is disproportionate.\n"
