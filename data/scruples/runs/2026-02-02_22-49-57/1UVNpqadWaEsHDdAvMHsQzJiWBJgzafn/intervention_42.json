Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let's see.\n\nThe situation is that the author's boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. He got offended and accused her of sexism. Then she points out that he had previously criticized vaginas and periods, which seems hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is being sexist. The boyfriend's comment about not having to deal with periods and implying that having a penis is better is problematic. The author's response is based on her personal observations and preferences. She's not making a generalization about all women, just her own feelings. She also points out the boyfriend's hypocrisy, which adds context.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling that his gender is being criticized. But the author isn't attacking men; she's expressing her opinion based on her experiences. The fact that he was first making a remark about women's bodies (periods) and then gets upset when she discusses male genitalia might indicate his own bias. The key here is whether the author's comments are sexist. Since she's stating her personal discomfort without making broad negative statements about men, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism seems misplaced. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
