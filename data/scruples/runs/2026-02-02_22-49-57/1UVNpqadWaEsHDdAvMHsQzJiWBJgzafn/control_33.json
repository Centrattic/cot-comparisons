Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because the boyfriend was criticizing vaginas and periods just before.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The boyfriend made a sexist remark by implying that dealing with periods is a negative thing and then suggesting that maybe having a penis would be better. The author's response is pointing out the discomforts of male genitalia, which could be seen as a counterargument. She's highlighting the downsides of male anatomy in response to his downplaying of female anatomy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to get offended and call her sexist. Is that justified? The author isn't making a generalization about all men; she's pointing out specific physical discomforts she observes in her boyfriend. So his reaction of labeling her as sexist might be a deflection. The boyfriend initially made a sexist comment, which is worse. The author is responding to his comment, so she's not the one initiating the sexism here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is itself a form of sexism because it trivializes women's experiences. The author is pushing back against that by pointing out the negatives of the male anatomy. Her response is a form of holding him accountable for his comments. \n\nIs there a deeper issue here? The boyfriend's reaction might stem from a defensiveness about his own body, but the initial problem was his sexist remark. The author's response is a valid reaction to his comment. The boyfriend's offense might be a way to avoid taking responsibility for his own comments.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding appropriately to his sexist statement. The boyfriend's reaction is the bigger issue here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
