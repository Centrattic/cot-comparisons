Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis.\n\nSo the situation is: she's on her period and her boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with that, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. Now she's confused because he was trashing vaginas and periods before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods and women's bodies, which is already problematic. Then when she gives her honest opinion about not desiring a penis, he gets upset and accuses her of being sexist. That seems a bit contradictory. He was criticizing her anatomy, but when she critiques his, he finds it offensive. \n\nIs the author being sexist? She's expressing a personal preference, not making a generalization or discrimination against an entire gender. She's pointing out the discomfort she observes in his body maintenance. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from defensiveness about his own anatomy. But does that make her wrong?\n\nAlso, the initial comment from the boyfriend about periods is a form of sexism. So when she pushes back, it's a response to his earlier remark. The fact that he's offended by her critique while he made a similar one about her might indicate a double standard. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is just voicing her opinion in response to his comment. Since he started the conversation by making a sexist remark, it's not her fault for standing up for herself. The key is that he was the one who first made a negative comment about her body, so her response is justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
