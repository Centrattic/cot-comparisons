Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" and then explained that she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. She mentions things like scratching and adjusting, which made her boyfriend offended, calling it sexist. Now he's upset and left to think about why it's upsetting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as trivializing her period, which is a valid bodily experience. Then he made a flip comment about her wishing she had a penis. The author is responding to his comment, which could be viewed as a bit dismissive or making light of her experience. \n\nWhen she says she doesn't want a penis, he takes offense. But why? The author's reasoning is based on her observation of the discomfort and maintenance involved with male genitalia. She's pointing out the downsides based on her observations. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was making a generalization about women wanting to avoid periods by having a penis. \n\nIs her response sexist? The term \"sexist\" is usually used to describe prejudice based on gender. The author isn't making a generalization that devalues one gender over another. Instead, she's expressing a personal preference based on her perception of physical discomfort. She did not make a value judgment about men or women, but rather stated her individual experience and feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, perhaps because he was already making a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience. When she pushed back, he might feel that she's now making negative comments about his body, hence calling it sexist. But the author is not attacking his gender; she's pointing out specific aspects that she finds uncomfortable. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend initiated the conversation with a comment that could be seen as undermining her experience. The author is responding truthfully to his question, not making a sexist statement. If anything, the boyfriend's initial comment was making a value judgment by implying that having a period is bad and that having a penis is better. The author is countering that by highlighting the downsides of male genitalia, which is a valid perspective. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's responding to his comment with her own honest opinion, backed by her observations. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be a deflection from his initial dismissive comment. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
