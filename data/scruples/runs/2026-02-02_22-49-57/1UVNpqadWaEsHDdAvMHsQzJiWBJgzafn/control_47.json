Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. So, first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and leaves in a huff. The author is confused because earlier he was criticizing periods, which she points out was okay.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial comment by the boyfriend, her response, his reaction, and the previous context where he was trashing vaginas and periods. The question is whether the author was wrong in her response.\n\nFirst, I should consider if the boyfriend's initial comment was inappropriate. He was making a dismissive or possibly sexist remark about her period and implying that having a penis would be better. The author's response is to state her preference not to have a penis because of discomfort. Is that a valid response? She's expressing her own feelings, which is her right. However, the boyfriend took it as sexist. Is there a double standard here?\n\nThe boyfriend was making a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. By responding that she doesn't want a penis, she's pointing out the potential downsides of male anatomy. But maybe he felt she was generalizing or making a stereotype about male genitalia? However, she's stating her personal dislike, not making a broad statement about all women.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensiveness when his own gender's traits are criticized, even if the author is just expressing her personal preferences. The fact that he had previously criticized her periods might indicate he has a history of making comments that are dismissive of her experience. The author is trying to call him out on that by pointing out the other side, but he takes offense instead of reflecting on his own comments.\n\nIs there a difference between being sexist and expressing a personal preference? The author isn't making a judgment about all people's anatomy, just her own. So she's not being sexist in her response. The boyfriend's comment about periods could be more problematic because it's a personal experience and he's dismissing it. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of storming off and saying to think about why what she said was upsetting might indicate that he's not open to discussing his own behavior. The author's response was a direct reaction to his initial comment, which was perhaps more sexist. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is defending her own feelings, which is valid. The boyfriend's behavior seems more like deflection or double standards. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. \n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The term \"sexist\" is a strong accusation. The author isn't making a generalization about all men or women, just stating her personal preference. So calling her sexist might be incorrect. The boyfriend's behavior in trashing vaginas and periods is the more concerning part. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
