Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. Let's look at the context.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a dick. The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist, then storms off.\n\nHmm. The boyfriend's initial comments are a bit dismissive and maybe even a bit disrespectful towards periods, which are a natural part of life. Then he makes a joke about her wishing for a penis, which is a bit flip. The author is honest about her feelings, pointing out the practical discomforts of male anatomy. The boyfriend reacts by calling her sexist, which seems contradictory because he was criticizing her body and its functions earlier.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, the author is expressing her bodily autonomy and preferences. She's not making a judgment about others but stating her own view. The boyfriend's reaction could be defensiveness because his own body or identity is being discussed, but his initial comments were more dismissive. \n\nIt seems like the boyfriend is the one being sexist by dismissing her period and making a joke about her anatomy. The author is just being honest about her perspective, which isn't inherently sexist. She's not saying that men are better or worse, just that she doesn't want that anatomy. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
