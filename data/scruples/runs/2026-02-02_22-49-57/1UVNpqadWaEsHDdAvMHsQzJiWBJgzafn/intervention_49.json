Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is a bit complex because it involves a relationship dynamic and differing perspectives on a sensitive topic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a woman who told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and joked about her wishing she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. He got offended and called her sexist. The author is confused because he had previously made negative comments about vaginas and periods, which she didn't call sexist, but now he's upset about her comment.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether her response was sexist or inconsiderate. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive or trivializing of her period and female anatomy. The author's response is a personal opinion about not wanting male genitalia, based on her observations of his behavior (like scratching or adjusting). He's taken offense, calling her sexist, which she finds hypocritical because he made similar comments earlier.\n\nNow, considering the definitions of sexism. Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on sex, typically against women. But in this case, the author is expressing her personal preference about anatomy, not making a negative generalization about all men or all people with male genitalia. She's not saying that having a penis is bad in a general sense, but that she personally finds it uncomfortable. The boyfriend's comment was a jab at periods and female anatomy, which could be seen as sexist because it devalues her experience.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author's comment is a critique of male anatomy, which he perceives as sexist. However, the author is not making a broad statement about men as a group, but sharing her personal view. Unless she made a generalized negative statement about men or their anatomy, it's more of a personal preference rather than sexism.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comment trivializing her period is problematic. Periods are a natural biological process, and making light of them can be seen as dismissive of women's health. The author's response is a direct, honest answer to his comment, which was itself a bit rude or insensitive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author's statement was a personal opinion without negative generalizations, then she might not be in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about defensiveness or feeling attacked, even if the author's comment was a direct response to his own. The key is whether her statement was sexist. Since she's not making a broad claim about all men, but expressing her own view, it's more of a personal preference. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's comment was the initial issue, and the author's response was a legitimate expression of her feelings."
