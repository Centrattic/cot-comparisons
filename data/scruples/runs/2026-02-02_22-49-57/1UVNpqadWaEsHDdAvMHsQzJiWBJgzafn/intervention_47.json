Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and she doesn't want that. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist, then got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her response was inappropriate. Her boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissive of her experience with menstruation, which is a sensitive topic. Then he made a jab about her not wanting a penis. The author's response is based on her observations and personal discomfort with certain aspects of male genitalia. She mentions things like scratching, rearranging, and discomfort, which are valid observations.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to label her as sexist. That's a strong accusation. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. In this case, the author is expressing a preference or opinion about her own body, not making a generalized negative statement about all men or their genitalia. She's talking about her own perspective and what she finds uncomfortable. So, it's more about personal preference rather than a sexist view.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about being glad he doesn't deal with periods and the comment about wishing he had a dick could be seen as minimizing the challenges women face with menstruation. The author is pushing back against that by expressing her own perspective, which seems reasonable. Her response is a direct but honest reaction to his comment, highlighting the other side of the coin\u2014male genitalia's maintenance and discomfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's getting upset and calling her sexist might be a deflection. He was already criticizing her experience, and she's pointing out that his side isn't all that better. His reaction of storming off and asking her to think about why she's upsetting him seems more about being defensive than a valid response to her statement.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author was responding to a comment that could be seen as dismissive. Her response is a personal opinion expressing her own views, which isn't inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly invalidating of her feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
