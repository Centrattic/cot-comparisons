Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after expressing her feelings about not wanting a penis to her boyfriend. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied that she might wish she had a penis. She responded that she didn't really want one, explaining that she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a dismissive or perhaps insensitive comment about her period, which is a sensitive topic for many. Then he made a joke or a comment implying that having a penis would be better, which she found trivializing. She expressed her genuine reasons for not wanting a penis, which were based on her observations and discomfort with male genitalia. He took offense, which seems a bit contradictory given his earlier comments.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and understanding in a relationship. The author was responding honestly to his comments. His reaction might stem from feeling that his male identity is being criticized, but her comments were about her personal preferences and experiences, not about his worth. He criticized her for being sexist, which could be a case of him deflecting his own sexism by accusing her of the same. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is important. The author addressed his initial comment (about periods) and then explained her stance on not wanting a penis, which is a personal choice. His reaction seems more about defensiveness than a constructive dialogue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation with a potentially dismissive remark. The author's response was a legitimate expression of her perspective, and his taking offense might be misplaced. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
