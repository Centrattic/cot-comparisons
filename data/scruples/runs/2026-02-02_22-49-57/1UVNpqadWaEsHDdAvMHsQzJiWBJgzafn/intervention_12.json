Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods and implying the author would wish for a penis. The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort and maintenance she observes in her boyfriend's male genitalia. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the author's experience with periods, which is a valid and common critique. He then makes a provocative remark about her wishing to have a penis, which could be seen as minimizing her experience. The author's response is a straightforward explanation of her discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out the maintenance aspects she finds undesirable. She's not making a value judgment about gender but expressing her personal physical preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized. By pointing out the discomforts he experiences, the author is highlighting a different aspect of male anatomy that he might not consider. However, his reaction is to label her as sexist, which is a misinterpretation. Sexism involves prejudice based on gender, but the author is discussing physical preferences, not making judgments about gender roles or capabilities.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author was honest about her feelings without attacking his gender. The boyfriend's defensiveness and labeling her as sexist seems disproportionate. He had previously made a disparaging comment about periods, which could be part of a pattern of minimizing her experiences. His reaction to her response might indicate that he's more focused on defending his own perspective rather than engaging in a constructive conversation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her genuine feelings. The boyfriend's issue stems from not wanting to confront his own gendered experiences being critiqued, even if it's just a preference. The situation is more about differing views and communication styles than actual wrongdoing by the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
