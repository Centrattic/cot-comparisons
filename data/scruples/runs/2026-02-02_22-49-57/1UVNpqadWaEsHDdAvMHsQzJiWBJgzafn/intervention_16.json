Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then saying something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't really want a penis, explaining discomfort with male genitalia. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, the author is defending her perspective, which is that having male genitalia seems uncomfortable and inconvenient. The boyfriend is upset, but he also made a comment trashing vaginas and periods. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is expressing her genuine feelings about not wanting male anatomy, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend, however, starts by making a joke that's dismissive of women's experiences (periods) and then gets defensive when confronted with the author's valid reasons for preferring female anatomy. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment might be seen as minimizing the challenges women face with their reproductive systems. Then, when the author states her preference, he labels her as sexist, which is a classic deflective move. The author isn't making a judgment about men but is explaining her own comfort and observations. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about feeling attacked in his masculinity rather than addressing her points.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is asserting her autonomy and her honest feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation with a derogatory remark. The author isn't wrong for pointing out the discomforts she observes in male genitalia, as that's her perspective. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
