Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend comments on periods and then the author responds about not wanting male genitalia. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive or even mocking of the author's experience with her period. Then, when the author states her preference not having a penis, he gets offended and accuses her of sexism. The key points here are mutual respect and the context of the conversation.\n\nThe author's response is a personal preference based on observations of her boyfriend's hygiene habits. She's expressing her opinion, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction, getting mad and storming off, might indicate he felt attacked, but his initial remarks were also critical of her body. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. Considering that people have different body image perceptions and preferences, her statement is her personal opinion. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be a deflection, as the author isn't making a broad statement about all men but expressing her own feelings. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for stating her preference. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially given his earlier comments. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
