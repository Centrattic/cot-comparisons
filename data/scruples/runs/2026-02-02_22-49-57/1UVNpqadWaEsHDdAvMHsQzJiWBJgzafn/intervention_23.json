Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of an \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation involves the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, and then the author responding that they don't want a penis. The boyfriend gets offended and calls the author sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The boyfriend starts by making a derogatory comment about periods and implies that having a penis is better. The author responds by expressing discomfort with male genitalia, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is to take offense and label the author as sexist.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in communication. The boyfriend's initial comment is dismissive of the author's experience with periods, which is a valid female experience. The author then shares their honest feelings about not wanting a penis, which is a personal opinion based on their observations. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that the author is making a generalization or judgment about his body, but the author is stating their own preference, not making a broad statement about all men.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is expressing their own feelings and observations. They didn't make a personal attack but rather shared their perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about defensiveness rather than the author's right to have that opinion. The boyfriend's initial trashing of periods and female anatomy might have set a tone of disrespect, leading to the argument. The author's response is within their right to express their own body image and preferences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
