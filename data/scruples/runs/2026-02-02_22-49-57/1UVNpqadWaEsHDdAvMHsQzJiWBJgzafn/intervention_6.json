Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, then saying the author might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't, citing discomfort with male genitalia. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend made a dismissive or trite comment about periods and then posed a hypothetical about having a penis. The author gave her honest opinion about the discomfort of male genitalia, which the boyfriend took as sexist. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response was wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods could be seen as minimizing her experience. Then, the hypothetical about a penis might be leading towards equating not having a period with being male. The author's response is based on her observations and personal feelings about male genitalia, which she finds uncomfortable. \n\nIs her response sexist? The author isn't making a generalization about all men or their abilities; she's expressing a personal preference based on her observations. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. He called periods a problem and then reacted negatively to criticism of male anatomy. \n\nThe concept of \"reverse sexism\" is sometimes used in arguments where someone claims their experiences are dismissed. Here, the author is pointing out the discomfort of male genitalia, which could be seen as a valid perspective. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized, but his initial comments about periods set a tone of trivializing her experience. \n\nIn terms of being sexist, the author isn't making a harmful generalization about gender roles or capabilities. She's sharing her personal view on a physical difference. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about defensiveness than a legitimate sexist accusation. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. Her response was a honest expression of her feelings, and the boyfriend's behavior started by dismissing her experience with periods. The author's stance isn't sexist; it's a personal preference based on observations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
