Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a person who shared a story on AITA) is in the wrong after expressing discomfort with having a penis and being called sexist by their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment that he was glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked about the author wishing they had a penis. The author responds that they don't want a penis because they find male genitalia uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend then gets offended and calls her sexist. The author argues that the boyfriend was first being negative about vaginas and periods, so they don't see why their comment was worse.\n\nSo, the main issues here are free speech, mutual respect in a relationship, and what constitutes sexism. The author is sharing their honest feelings about their body and preferences. They're not making a blanket statement about all women but expressing their personal view. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling devalued, but the author is just stating their opinion based on their observations (like the boyfriend checking his genitalia). \n\nThe boyfriend initiating the conversation by criticizing periods and vaginas seems more problematic. The author is responding to his comment, which was dismissive of her physical experiences. The key point is that the author isn't attacking men or their bodies in a general sense but is explaining their personal discomfort. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be misplaced because the author isn't making a gender-based generalization. Instead, they're discussing their own preferences and observations. \n\nIn relationships, it's important both partners feel heard, but also that they don't take offense where there isn't an intention to harm. The author isn't in the wrong if they were honest about their feelings, especially when the boyfriend started the conversation with his own disparaging remarks. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
