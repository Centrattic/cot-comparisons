  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend discussing body parts.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period and says she might wish she had a penis. The author responds that she doesn't really want a penis, explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the boyfriend's initial comment and the author's response. The boyfriend was making a dismissive or maybe even slightly insulting remark about periods, and then the author challenges his assumption by expressing her own views on having a penis. The boyfriend reacts negatively, feeling offended by her honest opinion.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's being honest about her preferences. The boyfriend made a joke or a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. When she pushes back, he takes it as sexism, which might be a deflection. The fact that he was \"trashing vaginas and periods\" just before she responded suggests he's the one making the problematic statements.\n\nHer response is about her personal feelings towards male anatomy, which is valid. She's not attacking him personally but stating her perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion and maybe he's in the wrong for being defensive and calling her sexist when she's just expressing her opinion. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
