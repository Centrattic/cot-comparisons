Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. The boyfriend was making a joke about not having to deal with periods, and when she expressed discomfort with male genitalia, he reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend made a comment implying that having a penis is better because he doesn't have to deal with periods. The author's response is a genuine expression of her discomfort with male anatomy. She's stating her personal preference and observations, not making a derogatory statement about men or their bodies. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling criticized, but the author wasn't attacking him personally. She's explaining her own feelings without making a generalized negative statement about all men. Being offended by someone expressing their personal preferences could be an issue here. Also, the boyfriend's earlier comments about trashing vaginas and periods might have set a tone of casual sexism, which the author is now challenging.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not in the wrong because she's responding honestly to his comment. The boyfriend's taking offense might be misplaced if he's not considering her perspective. The key here is that expressing one's own preferences and bodily discomfort isn't sexist. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
