I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had a disagreement about surprise visits, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When you're in a partnership, especially with someone's family, setting boundaries is important. The author expressed their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a reasonable request. They mentioned wanting personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. That's about respecting their own space and needs.\n\nThe partner's family seems to see this as being too opinionated, but the author is just stating their preferences. It's not about being aggressive unless the way they expressed it was harsh. The author said they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare time they spoke up. That suggests they were trying to be polite but had to set a boundary.\n\nThe partner is defending her family's habits, but maybe she hasn't considered the author's perspective. The key here is shared living space. The author's house is a joint space, so their input should matter. It's about mutual respect. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asserting their need for privacy and control over their home environment.\n\nI don't see any evidence that the author overstepped. They're not banning all visits, just expressing a preference for planned ones. The family's reaction seems to stem from not wanting to change their habits, which is their own issue. The author is in the right to set these boundaries. So, the answer should be B.\n"
