I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and partner's family came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. They discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike, saying they like some days to themselves and don't want the house in a mess. The partner and family are upset, thinking it's not fair and labeling the author as aggressive for not usual expressing this.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's right to their own preferences and the partner's family's expectations. The author is sharing their house, so it's reasonable to have boundaries. The partner might be caught between her family's social norms and her partner's differing ones. The author's response was straightforward, not overly aggressive, just stating their need for personal space. The family might not be used to such openness, so the author's \"biting their tongue\" previously might have led to this sudden expression being seen as harsh. But is that the author's fault? Probably not. They have a right to their privacy. The divide is more about differing values than the author being wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
