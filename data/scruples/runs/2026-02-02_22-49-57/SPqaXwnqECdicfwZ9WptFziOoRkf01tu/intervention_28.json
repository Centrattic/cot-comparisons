I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is wrong for not liking unexpected guests.\n\nThe situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends surprise each other at home. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author disagrees, saying they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The author also mentions not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced. This caused a divide, with the partner thinking it's unfair and the author's own house. The partner's parents labeled the author as aggressively opinionated because they usually don't share their opinions around them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main issue: boundaries in a shared living space. The author is expressing discomfort with unexpected guests, which could be about personal space and privacy. The partner's family sees it as a positive surprise, but the author doesn't. The key here is whether the author overstepped by expressing their dislike.\n\nThe author's points are about personal needs and the state of the home. They didn't make a demand but stated their preference. The partner's family might have different social norms, expecting more openness to guests. However, the author is part of the household now, so their input should be considered.\n\nThe partner is caught in the middle, feeling her family's expectations are being challenged. The author's statement that the house is \"just as much theirs as hers\" is a valid point about shared ownership and mutual respect. The author isn't being aggressive but setting boundaries. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not being used to someone else's preferences in the home.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs, especially in their own home. The issue is more about differing expectations. The partner's family might need to adjust to the author's boundaries. So the answer is B (No).\n"
