I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family came back from a trip and had a meal. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they might have things to do and need some alone time, and also mentioned not wanting the house to look messy if someone shows up. This led to a divide, with the partner and parents feeling it's unfair and labeling the author as being aggressive.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong here? The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The author's main points are about personal boundaries and needing space. They mentioned that the house is as much theirs as the partner's, which is a valid point. People have different social preferences\u2014some enjoy spontaneous visits, others prefer notice. The author communicated their discomfort, which is reasonable. However, the partner's family might have different expectations, possibly rooted in their own cultural or family norms.\n\nBut is the author wrong for not liking unscheduled guests? Probably not. It's about personal space and communication. The issue arises when the author's preferences clash with the partner's family's habits. The author isn't being aggressive; they're expressing their needs. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding or respecting those boundaries. However, since the partner is caught between her family and her partner, there's a relational dynamic here.\n\nI think the author is justified in expressing their feelings. The wrong here might be more on the partner's family for not respecting the author's boundaries. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, just set a boundary, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
