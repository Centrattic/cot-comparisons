I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family are used to showing up unannounced, but the author doesn't like that. They had a disagreement, the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's partner's parents labeled them as aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries in relationships. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected visitors, especially since they might have things to do or need alone time. The partner and her family see it as a surprise, but the author is against it, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. They expressed their opinion, which seems reasonable. The partner's family has their own habits, but the author is part of the relationship now. The house is shared, so both sides should have input. The author isn't necessarily being aggressive; they're setting boundaries. The problem arises when the partner and her family don't respect that.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they clearly communicated their feelings in a respectful way, then no. The issue here is more about differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy and respecting their own needs. The partner's family might be in the wrong for not respecting the new boundary. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
