I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about not liking unexpected guests in their home, which led to a conflict with the partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland and had a nice dinner. The topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The partner's family now thinks the author is being aggressive, while the author stands by their opinion, emphasizing that the house is shared.\n\nNow, considering social norms and boundaries. It's common for people to have different comfort levels with unexpected visitors. The author is asserting their right to privacy in their own home, which is a valid point. The partner's family might be used to a more open style of visiting without notice, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries. \n\nThe key here is the concept of shared space. If the author is living with their partner, the house is indeed their shared space. The author has the right to express their preferences about how the space is used. The partner might feel that the family's tradition or habit is being disrupted, but the author is also entitled to their needs. \n\nThe author's response was direct but not hostile. They mentioned wanting personal time and house readiness, which are reasonable concerns. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a misinterpretation. The author wasn't being hostile; they were stating their preferences clearly. \n\nPossible angles to consider: cultural differences in visiting norms, the importance of communication in relationships, and mutual respect. The author could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing it with the partner first before the dinner, but their response during the dinner was still valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their discomfort and setting boundaries in their shared home. It's important for all parties to respect each other's needs.\n"
