I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family enjoy surprising each other at home, but the author doesn't like it. They expressed their dislike, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they have their own space and boundaries. They mentioned needing time to themselves and not wanting the house in disarray if someone shows up unannounced. That seems reasonable. People do have the right to their personal space and preferences.\n\nOn the other side, the partner and her family see these surprise visits as a nice tradition. The partner is upset that the author is objecting, and the author is being labeled as aggressive. The key here is whether expressing a boundary is considered being in the wrong.\n\nIn many cases, setting boundaries is healthy. The author didn't act out aggressively but stated their preferences. The problem might be more about differing expectations between the author and their partner's family. The author's house is shared, so they have a right to input on who enters it. The partner's family might not have realized the impact of their actions.\n\nBut the partner is taking the author's stance as unfair. The divide here could be because the partner isn't respecting the author's need for personal space. The author isn't wrong for expressing their feelings; the issue might be communication or mutual understanding.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their space, which is valid. The conflict stems from differing views on social interactions, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
