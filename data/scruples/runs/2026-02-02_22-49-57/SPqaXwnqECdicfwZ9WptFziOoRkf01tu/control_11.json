I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a divide with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, their partner, and her family returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. They discussed how the partner's parents and their friends often show up unannounced. The partner and sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author explained they prefer some privacy and having a day to themselves, which led to conflict. The partner now thinks it's unfair, and the author's expressing their opinion made them seem aggressive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. The author is stating their preferences, which is reasonable. They mentioned that it's their house too, so having a say over unexpected guests makes sense. However, the way the author expressed their feelings might have come across as harsh, especially if they usually keep their opinions to themselves. The partner and family might feel disrespected or ignored if the author didn't communicate this before. But the author's right to privacy and autonomy in their own home is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner's family might see unannounced visits as normal, so the author's sudden objection could be a culture clash. However, the author isn't wrong for having different expectations. The key here is communication. The author did express their feelings, albeit maybe not in the best way. The partner's family might need to adjust, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
