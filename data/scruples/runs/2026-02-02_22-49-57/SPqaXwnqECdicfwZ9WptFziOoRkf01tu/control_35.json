I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The scenario involves the author's partner and her family who are used to visiting each other without notice. The author expressed their discomfort, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is living in a house that's shared with their partner, so it's a shared space. The partner's family has a habit of showing up unannounced, which the author finds intrusive. The author explained their reasons\u2014needing personal time and maintaining the house's condition. The partner is upset that the author isn't on board with the family's social norms, and the author is being criticized as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries, especially in a shared living space. Everyone has the right to personal space and time. The partner's family might be used to their own way of doing things, but the author isn't obligated to conform if it makes them uncomfortable. The key point is communication and mutual respect. The author did express their feelings calmly, which is appropriate. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations since it's a shared home now. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their privacy and the house's state. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
