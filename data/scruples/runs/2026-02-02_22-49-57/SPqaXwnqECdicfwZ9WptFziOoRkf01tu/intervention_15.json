I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had a disagreement about surprise visits. The partner's family thinks it's okay to drop by without notice, but the author doesn't like it because they value their personal time and space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a household, so their home is shared. When the partner's family shows up unannounced, it's an invasion of the author's personal space. The author's main points are about having things to do and needing a day to themselves, and keeping the house presentable. Those are valid concerns. \n\nThe partner is defending the family's behavior, saying it's unfair, but the author is asserting their right to the home. The partner's family even labeled the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a deflection. The author had been holding back their opinions before, which is common in relationships to avoid conflict, but now they've expressed their feelings. \n\nI should think about boundaries. It's reasonable for the author to set boundaries about their home and personal time. The partner's family might not realize how their actions affect others. The key here is mutual respect. If the author's partner is saying it's unfair, maybe the partner isn't considering the author's perspective. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were just back from a trip and had a planned meal adds to the tension. The author wanted to enjoy that time without interruptions. The partner's family's habit of surprising each other is a cultural or family norm, but it shouldn't override another person's comfort. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for expressing their dislike. They have a right to their space and needs. The partner and her family should adapt to respect the author's boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
