I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just got back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends sometimes show up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and they don't want the house to be messy if someone drops by. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair that her family can't just show up, and the author is being called aggressively opinionated by her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting boundaries about their personal space and time, which is a common issue in relationships. The partner's family seems to have a different cultural or family norm where unexpected visits are a nice surprise. However, the author is clear that this isn't their preference. The key points here are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe author did express their feelings, even if it was after usually biting their tongue. They mentioned they have things to do and need personal days. That's reasonable. The partner's family might not have realized that this was an issue before, so the author is asserting their needs now. The partner is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's boundaries.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? If the house is shared, then it's the author's right to have boundaries. The partner's family might need to adjust, just as the author might need to adjust to other aspects of the partner's family's habits. The author isn't saying they can't have guests ever, just that they don't want unannounced visits. It's about respecting each other's preferences. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The issue might be more about the partner and her family not respecting those boundaries once they're communicated. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
