I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends drop by each other's houses as surprises. The partner and her sister like the idea, but the author doesn't. The author explained that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do and need some alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced. This led to a conflict where the partner says it's not fair, and the author's partner's family now sees them as being too opinionated.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries. The author is asserting their right to have their space and time, which is a common issue in relationships. The partner's family is used to surprise visits, which might be a cultural or family norm for them. The author is pushing back, which the partner and family are interpreting as being aggressive, even though the author usually holds back their opinions.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a valid point about personal space and privacy. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially if unexpected guests disrupt their routine or stress them out. On the other hand, the partner's family might see this as being rude or uncooperative. But the author is the one living in the house, so it's their space too. They have a right to not want strangers (even relatives) showing up uninvited.\n\nThe partner's reaction is problematic because they're defending their family's behavior without considering the author's perspective. The family labeling the author as aggressively opinionated seems unfair if the author is just stating their needs calmly. The author's approach was to explain their stance, not to attack. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting healthy boundaries. The issue might be that the partner hasn't communicated effectively about this topic before, leading to the current conflict. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
