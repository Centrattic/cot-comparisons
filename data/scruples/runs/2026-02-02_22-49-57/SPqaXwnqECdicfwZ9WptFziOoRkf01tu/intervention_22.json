I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused some conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, the author had a pre-booked fancy meal after a holiday, and they were discussing how the partner's parents and friends often show up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with that, saying they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people drop by. The partner's family is upset, calling the author aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author is setting boundaries about their personal space and time. They live in the house with their partner, so it's their home too. The partner's family might not respect that the author has different preferences. The partner is taking their family's side, which complicates things.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. In general, people have the right to set boundaries in their own home. The author didn't say it's never okay, just that they don't like it. The partner's family might see it as negative, but the author is being honest about their feelings. The key here is mutual respect and understanding different perspectives. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're explaining their own needs. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about their own expectations versus the author's boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to have their preferences respected. The answer should be B.\n"
