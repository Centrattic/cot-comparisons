I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author didn't like the idea, explaining they might have things to do or need alone time. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author's opinion caused a divide. The partner says it's unfair, and the author says it's their house too. The partner's family labeled the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is reasonable. The author is stating their preference for not liking unexpected guests, which is a valid personal boundary. They mentioned having their own plans and needing personal space. Setting boundaries is generally acceptable. However, the conflict arises because the author's partner and her family view this as restrictive. The key point is whether the author overstepped by expressing their preference, especially in the context of the partner's family expecting to visit without notice.\n\nThe author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs as hers\" is important. If the house is shared, then both parties have a right to set rules about guests. The author's objection isn't about denying guests entirely but about prior notice. The partner's family might feel that the author is being too rigid, but the author is justified in wanting to manage their space. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair if the author calmly expressed their view. The problem might be more about differing social norms and expectations rather than the author being wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries. It's reasonable to expect that guests should be invited, especially in a shared space. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations. The author's response was appropriate, and the conflict stems from differing perspectives rather than a clear wrongdoing. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
