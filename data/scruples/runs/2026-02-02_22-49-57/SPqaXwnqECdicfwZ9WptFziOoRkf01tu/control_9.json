I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault.\n\nThe scenario is about unexpected guests. The person (author) and their partner's family just came back from Iceland. They had a pre-booked meal at a fancy restaurant. The author doesn't like surprise visits, explaining they might have things to do and need personal time. The partner's family thinks it's a nice surprise, but the author is against it. The partner is now saying it's unfair, and the author's being seen as aggressive for finally speaking up.\n\nFirst, consider boundaries. The author is expressing a valid need for personal space and time, which is reasonable. No one should be expected to drop everything for others. The author's house is shared, so both partners have equal claim to its use. The partner's family might not realize the impact of unannounced visits, especially after a trip where rest is needed.\n\nCommunication style is another angle. The author mentions they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare expression of opinion. The partner and family might perceive this as aggressive because they're not used to it. However, the author has the right to set boundaries in their own home.\n\nThe partner's family's perspective is that they view unannounced visits as a positive. But the author's discomfort is legitimate. The key here is mutual respect. The partner should acknowledge the author's feelings and mediate, not take sides against the author. The author isn't wrong for having boundaries; they're asserting their needs, which is healthy in a relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their personal space and the shared home, which is valid. The partner and family need to respect those boundaries.\n"
