I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner and her family often have surprise visits, which the author doesn't like. They had a conflict after discussing this during a meal after a trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with the partner, and they share a house. The partner's family has a habit of showing up unannounced, which the author is uncomfortable with. The author expressed their concerns calmly, explaining that they need personal time and want the house to be presentable. The partner's family reacted negatively, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's right to personal space and autonomy in their own home versus the partner's family's tradition of surprise visits. The author is part of the household, so their feelings about unexpected guests should be respected. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective, especially since the author usually holds back their opinions. The author's response was straightforward and reasonable, not aggressive.\n\nIn relationships, especially when merging with a partner's family, mutual respect is crucial. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're setting boundaries. The partner's family's reaction might stem from a lack of communication or understanding. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain their privacy and control over their home environment. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
