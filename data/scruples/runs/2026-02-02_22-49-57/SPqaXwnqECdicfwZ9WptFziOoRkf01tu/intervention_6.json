I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disagreement about unexpected guests. The writer, their partner, and her family had just returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. The partner's parents and friends drop by unannounced, and the writer expressed their dislike for this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer is not in favor of surprise visits because they might have things to do or need alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if guests show up. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, while the writer feels it's an intrusion. The partner is upset because the writer didn't want the family to drop by, and the writer is labeled as aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and mutual respect. When someone is in a relationship, especially living together, it's important to respect each other's preferences. The writer is stating their preference clearly without attacking the partner's family. They're not saying the family is wrong but that their own needs matter. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the writer is wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nThe partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but fairness can be subjective. The writer's house is also their home, so they have the right to set rules. The writer's issue isn't with the partner's family in general but with the unannounced visits. The key here is whether expressing a personal boundary is wrong. Generally, it's not; communication is essential in relationships to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nThe writer might need to discuss this with their partner to find a compromise, but the initial action of stating their preference isn't in the wrong. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, but the writer isn't at fault for having different expectations. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
