I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They and their partner's family just got back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends drop by unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do or need alone time, and they don't want the house to be messy. This caused a conflict because the partner thinks it's unfair and the family now thinks the author is being aggressive.\n\nSo, the main issue is about unexpected guests and boundaries. The author is a partner in a relationship, sharing a house with their partner. They're saying that they have their own needs and that others should respect their space. The partner's family is used to dropping by, but the author is uncomfortable with that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a right to set boundaries. In a shared living situation, especially in a marriage or long-term partnership, both individuals should have input on how the home is managed. The author isn't saying they never want guests over, just that unannounced visits are an issue. They mentioned they might have things to do and need alone time, which is a valid personal need. \n\nThe partner's family might see this as being rude or too rigid, but the author is asserting their right to privacy and autonomy in their own home. The partner is taking the family's side, which could indicate that they haven't considered the author's perspective enough. \n\nThe divide seems to stem from differing cultural or family norms. The partner's family is used to being spontaneous, while the author prefers planning. The key here is that the author is being honest about their preferences, which is reasonable. The partner's family is now labeling the author as aggressive, which might be a defense mechanism because they feel their usual behavior is being challenged. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort. Everyone has different boundaries, and it's important to communicate them. The root of the problem might be that the partner isn't mediating between her family's habits and her partner's needs. The author is justified in stating that the house is shared and that they have a right to their own space. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
