I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They returned from a trip and had a nice meal discussing the partner's family's habit of showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, stating they need personal time and that the house might not be ready. This caused a conflict, with the partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is sharing a home with their partner, so their preferences matter. The partner's family's behavior might be seen as intrusive. The author had to bite their tongue before, which built up tension. Expressing their opinion now is a boundary setting. \n\nCultural differences might play a role. If the partner's family is from a culture where drop-ins are common, there could be a clash. However, the author has a right to their personal space and time. The partner's family's reaction seems dismissive of the author's needs. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to have boundaries and the partner's family not respecting those. The author didn't act out of aggression but was stating their needs. The partner's family's labeling is a deflection. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their boundaries in a shared living situation. The answer should be B.\n"
