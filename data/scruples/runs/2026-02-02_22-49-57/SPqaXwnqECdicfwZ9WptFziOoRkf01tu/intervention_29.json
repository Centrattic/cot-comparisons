I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The person wrote that they don't like unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family. The partner's family thinks it's okay to show up unannounced, but the author is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect in relationships and boundaries. The author lives in the same house as their partner, so it's reasonable for them to express their discomfort about unannounced visits. They mentioned they might have things to do or need alone time, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe partner's family might view this as being too controlling, but the author isn't preventing guests entirely; they're just wanting a say in who comes over. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but now expressed them could be seen as a necessary step when the issue is significant. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to indicate that they didn't consider the author's perspective. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is about shared space and ownership, which is a legitimate point. The family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding of their need for boundaries.\n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their shared living space. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
