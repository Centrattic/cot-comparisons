I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The scenario involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to dropping by unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author shares a home with their partner, so their living space should be a shared space. The author's concern about needing personal time and not wanting to be interrupted is valid. People have different boundaries, and it's reasonable for the author to set them. \n\nThe partner is upset because the author is now not allowing family to drop by, which they see as a change from the author usually keeping quiet. The partner's family feels labeled as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a misunderstanding. The author is asserting their right to control their own space, which is a normal and healthy boundary.\n\nThe key points are: the author is setting boundaries in their shared home, which is their right. The partner and her family might not have considered the author's perspective before. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're communicating their needs. The conflict arises from differing expectations about personal space and family interactions. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for expressing their needs. The partner and family might need to adjust their behavior to accommodate the author's preferences. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
