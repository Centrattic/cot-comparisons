I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland. They had a fancy dinner planned as a way to wrap up the trip. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends surprise each other by showing up unannounced at each other's houses. The author's partner and sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like it because they might have plans or need to get things done and sometimes want a day to themselves without people showing up. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone comes by. Now, there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just visit whenever, and the author is saying it's their house too. The partner's parents are calling the author \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually hold their tongue around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author is setting a boundary about unexpected guests in their own home. The partner's family might not have considered that the author might have different needs. The author's home is shared, so they have a right to set rules. However, the partner is pushing back because it's her family's tradition or something. The author is being straightforward about their feelings, which is reasonable. The partner's family might be used to having their way and not considering others' perspectives. The partner is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's needs. \n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? Maybe not. They're expressing their needs without being hostile, just stating their preferences. The partner's family might be overreacting by labeling the author as aggressive. The key here is that the author is asserting their own comfort in their shared home, which is valid. The partner needs to mediate here because it's her family and her partner. The author isn't wrong for expressing their feelings, especially since they're in a shared living space. The family's surprise visits are a cultural or family norm, but that doesn't mean they should override the author's preferences. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
