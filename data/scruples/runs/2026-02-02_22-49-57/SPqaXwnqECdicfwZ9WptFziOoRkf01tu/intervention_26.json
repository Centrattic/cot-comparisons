I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained they might have things to do, need a day to themselves, and that the house might not be ready for unexpected guests. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair her family can't just drop by. The author says it's their house too, and the family thinks the author is being aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know what I think. The answer should be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author expressed their discomfort with unexpected guests. They mentioned having tasks to do and needing alone time. They also said the house might not be in order if guests arrive unannounced. The partner's family is upset, calling the author aggressive for not biting their tongue.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're asserting their boundaries in their own home. It's reasonable to want control over when people visit, especially if they have plans or need personal time. The partner's family's expectation of surprise visits might be common in their culture or family, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nThe conflict arises from differing expectations. The partner is caught between her family's norms and her partner's preferences. The author isn't refusing all visitors, just unannounced ones. They're not being unreasonable by expressing their feelings. The family's reaction of labeling the author as aggressive seems unfair if the author was just stating their needs without being hostile.\n\nIn relationships, communication of boundaries is important. The author tried to communicate their stance, which is valid. The partner's family's pushback might stem from not respecting those boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting to maintain some control over their living space and time.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (no, the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the right to set boundaries, the context of the situation (post-travel, needing time to oneself), and the reasonable nature of the author's concerns.\n"
