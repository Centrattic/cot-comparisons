I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner and her family have this habit of showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort with this, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author lives in the same house as their partner, so it's reasonable for them to want control over their space. Unexpected guests can disrupt plans and personal time, which the author explained they need for getting things done or having a day to themselves. That seems valid.\n\nThen, the partner's side thinks it's a nice surprise, but the author's perspective is about respecting their space. The author clarified that the house is shared, so the family shouldn't assume they can drop by anytime. The partner's family is now calling the author \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a deflection from the actual issue of respecting boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did share their feelings, which is important. The problem arises when the partner's family isn't respecting those boundaries. The author isn't wrong for setting limits, especially in their own home. The partner's reaction suggests they might not have considered the author's need for personal space before. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
