I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had just come back from a trip and had a pre-booked meal. The discussion about surprise visits from the partner's parents and friends came up. The author expressed their dislike for unexpected guests, explaining they might need time to themselves and that the house should be presentable. The partner's family now thinks the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their feelings. It's reasonable for someone to want privacy and time alone. The partner's family's expectation of surprise visits might be a cultural or family norm, but the author has the right to set boundaries in a shared living space. The key point is that the author is asserting their space, which is valid. The partner's side is upset because they feel it's not fair, but they need to respect the author's perspective. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" seems harsh if the author was just expressing their opinion calmly. The author isn't wrong for having different social preferences. So the answer is B.\n"
