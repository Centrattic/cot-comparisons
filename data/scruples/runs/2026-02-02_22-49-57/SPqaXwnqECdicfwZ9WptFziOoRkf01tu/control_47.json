I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a nice dinner. At the dinner, they talked about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and sister like the surprise visits, but the author doesn't. They mentioned wanting personal time and privacy. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's being called aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal boundary. They even gave reasons: needing to get things done, wanting a day to themselves, and the house being messy. The partner's side is used to surprising each other, so this might be a cultural or family norm. \n\nThe author is asserting their right to the house as much as the partner. That's a key point. If you're in a relationship, especially sharing a home, both partners should have a say in how the space is used. The author didn't lash out but stated their feelings calmly. The partner's family is taking offense, thinking the author is being too opinionated, but the author was defending their personal space. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The author isn't being rude; they're setting boundaries. The partner's family's expectation of dropping by without notice might be the issue. The author's stance is about mutual respect and shared living space. The partner might need to mediate between her family's habits and her partner's preferences. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs in a shared home. The problem lies in the partner's family not respecting that boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
