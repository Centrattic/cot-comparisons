I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not liking unexpected guests. They went on a trip with their partner and her family, and after returning, they had a disagreement about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, saying they prefer having a day to themselves and not wanting the house to be messy. The partner and her family are upset, labeling the author as being too aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. It's common for people to have different preferences. The author owns the house too, so having autonomy over when guests come is valid. Expressing this shouldn't be a problem. The partner's family might not have considered the author's perspective, assuming it's as much their home. However, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. They just communicated their feelings, which is healthy. The family's reaction seems more about not respecting those boundaries rather than the author being at fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
