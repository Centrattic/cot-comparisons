I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a reservation at a fancy restaurant. During dinner, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need personal time. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author is now seen as being aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author expressed their feelings calmly, stating they prefer not to have unannounced guests. They also mentioned the house being messy, which is a valid concern. The partner's family is used to surprising each other, which might be their cultural or family norm. However, the author is part of the household now, so their preferences should be considered. The partner is caught in the middle, trying to balance both her family's habits and her partner's boundaries.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting their own boundaries? Probably not. It's reasonable to want personal space and time. The problem might be in how the partner's family is reacting, assuming the house is only \"theirs.\" The author is asserting that it's shared. The partner's family might not have considered that the author has different preferences.\n\nBut maybe the way the author communicated it was a bit abrupt? They said they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare occasion where they spoke up. The parents labeled them as aggressive, which might be a deflection if they're used to having their way. The author isn't wrong for expressing their needs, especially in a shared home. Boundaries are important, so B (no) makes sense here.\n"
