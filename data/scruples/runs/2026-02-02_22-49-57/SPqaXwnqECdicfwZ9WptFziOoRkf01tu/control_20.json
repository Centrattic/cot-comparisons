I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their partner's family expecting to drop by unannounced, and the author expressing discomfort with that. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do or need alone time. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. The partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's opinion is being seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is sharing their home with their partner's family, which is a valid concern. People have different boundaries, and it's reasonable to want some personal space. The author isn't being aggressive, they're stating their preferences. The partner's family might not have considered that the author's home isn't just their partner's\u2014it's a shared space. The author has a right to set boundaries about unexpected guests. The partner's reaction might stem from not understanding or respecting those boundaries. The divide arises because the expectations aren't aligned. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their needs. The partner's family's expectation of dropping by without notice isn't respectful of the author's need for privacy and personal time. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're asserting their right to have boundaries in their own home.\n"
