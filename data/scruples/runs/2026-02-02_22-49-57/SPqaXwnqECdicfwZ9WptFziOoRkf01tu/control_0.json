I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author and their partner, along with her family, returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner planned. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends sometimes surprise each other by showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like the idea, but the author doesn't. They expressed that they don't like it because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and also mentioned the house being in a state if people just drop by. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair that her family can't just visit whenever, while the author argues that the house is shared and they need boundaries. The partner's family now sees the author as too opinionated.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. The author is expressing their personal preference about not liking unexpected guests, which is their right. They mentioned having their own time and needing privacy, which are valid reasons. The partner's family, on the other hand, has their own social norms where surprise visits are common. The conflict arises because of differing expectations about personal space and boundaries.\n\nThe author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their preferences. The partner's family's reaction seems to be about their own discomfort with the author setting boundaries. The author is in a shared living space, so it's reasonable to expect that the partner's family should respect that space. The key point is that the author communicated their feelings calmly and gave reasons, which is appropriate. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding or deflection from their own need to adjust their behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs in a shared space, which is necessary for mutual respect. The partner's family needs to adapt, not the author. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
