I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which is causing a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from a trip. They had a planned meal at a fancy restaurant. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and want some alone time. The author also mentioned the house being in order if there's an unexpected visit. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair her family can't just visit whenever. The author's response was that the house is theirs, and they usually hold back their opinions, leading the in-laws to label them as aggressive.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries, communication, and differing expectations. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a valid personal boundary. However, the partner and her family see these visits as friendly and spontaneous. The author's response was direct, which might have come off as harsh, but they weren't overly aggressive. They had been holding back their opinions before, so this might explain the family's reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. It's reasonable to want privacy and control over when guests come. The problem might be in how the author communicated their feelings. Maybe they could have approached it more gently to avoid conflict. However, the partner's family's expectation of being able to drop by without notice might not consider others' feelings. The divide seems to stem from differing family norms. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for expressing their need for personal space. It's their home, and they have the right to set rules. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations. The author's statement about the house being theirs is valid, but the way it was said could have been smoother. However, the core issue is about respecting each other's preferences. Since the author was clear about their stance (after holding back), they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The partner's family might need to adapt. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in wanting control over their living space and expressing their boundaries, even if it caused tension.\n"
