I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner's family who are used to dropping by unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort during a meal after a trip, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is in a committed relationship, sharing a home. Expressing a need for personal space isn't unreasonable. People have different social norms, and it's important for both parties to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nThe partner's family is used to surprising each other, which shows their cultural or family norm. However, the author's home is a shared space, so their comfort should matter. The author didn't outright ban guests but communicated their preference, which is a reasonable approach. The partner's reaction might be due to not realizing how important this boundary is to the author.\n\nThe author labeled their home as \"just as much mine as it is hers,\" which is valid. When people live together, both should have input on household rules. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair, especially since the author usually holds back their opinions, making this a justified stand.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express their feelings calmly, mentioning needing time to themselves and not wanting the house messy. The partner's side might feel slighted, but that doesn't negate the author's valid needs. It's about mutual respect rather than right or wrong.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their boundaries in a shared living situation, which is necessary for their well-being. The partner's family's reaction is more about adjusting to new norms rather than the author being at fault. Answer B.\n"
