I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who have a habit of showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort with this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is living in a shared house, which is also the partner's family's home. The key point here is that the author is asserting their own boundaries. The partner and her family see showing up without notice as a nice surprise, but the author finds it inconvenient and intrusive. The author explained that they might have things to do or need personal time, and they don't want the house to be untidy when guests drop by.\n\nThe partner's family is upset, labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated.\" The partner is also upset, saying it's unfair they can't just visit whenever. The author's stance is that it's their home too, so there should be mutual respect for boundaries.\n\nNow, considering social norms and personal boundaries, it's reasonable for someone to want control over their living space. Everyone has the right to set boundaries about visitors. The author didn't act out of malice; they simply communicated their preferences. The partner's family's reaction suggests they aren't used to such boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nThe divide comes from differing expectations. The author's partner might not have realized the extent of their family's behavior's impact. The author's response was about setting limits, which is valid. The partner's family might be projecting their own habits as the norm, but that doesn't justify intruding on someone else's space without notice.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs and respecting their own living space. The conflict arises from clashing expectations, but the author's actions are justified in maintaining personal boundaries.\n"
