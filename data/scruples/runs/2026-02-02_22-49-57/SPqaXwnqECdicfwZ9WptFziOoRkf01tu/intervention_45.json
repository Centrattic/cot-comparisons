I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just returned from Iceland. They had a fancy dinner planned to end the trip. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends dropping by unannounced as a surprise. The partner and her sister like this, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do and need time to themselves, and also mentioned the house might not be clean if people show up without notice. This caused a conflict with the partner and family, who now think the author is being too opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is stating their discomfort with surprise guests, which is a valid personal boundary. People have different preferences regarding their personal space and time. The partner's family and sister seem to prefer spontaneity, but the author's response was about needing privacy and time alone. \n\nThe author's statement about the house not being in order if someone shows up unannounced is practical. It's reasonable for someone to want to manage their home environment as they see fit. The partner seems upset that the author is setting this boundary, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The partner may not have considered the author's perspective, but the author's right to express their feelings about their shared space isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe term \"aggressively opinionated\" from the partner's family might indicate that the author's communication style is perceived as harsh. However, the author mentioned they usually \"bite their tongue,\" implying that this was a rare instance where they shared their actual feelings. The partner's family's reaction could be more about the sudden expression of differing views rather than the content itself.\n\nIn shared living situations, both parties need to respect each other's comfort levels. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries; the issue may lie more with the partner and family not anticipating or respecting those boundaries. The author's actions were about asserting their own needs, which is a healthy part of a relationship.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
