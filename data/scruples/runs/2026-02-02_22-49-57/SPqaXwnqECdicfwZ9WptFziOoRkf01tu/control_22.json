I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The partner and her family have a tradition of showing up unannounced, but the author finds that intrusive. They had a pre-booked fancy dinner after a trip, and when the topic came up, the author expressed their discomfort. Now the partner is saying it's not fair, and the author's being called aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some families, dropping by unannounced is common and seen as friendly. But the author is part of a partnership now, so their home is shared. The author has a valid reason\u2014maybe needing personal space or time, or to keep the house tidy. The key point here is that the author is asserting their boundaries, which is important in a relationship. \n\nThe partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions. The author's response was straightforward but not hostile, just stating their preference. Being labeled as aggressive suggests a possible misunderstanding or resistance to changing family traditions. But the author isn't wrong for having boundaries. They have the right to their own space and preferences, especially in a shared home. \n\nThe divide might stem from unmet expectations. The partner and her family might see the author's stance as cold, while the author sees their own need for privacy. It's a conflict of values. Since the author communicated their feelings and the situation is their home, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
