I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story about not liking unexpected guests is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The key points are:\n\n1. The author and their partner returned from Iceland, had a planned meal, and discussed the partner's family showing up unannounced.\n2. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they might have things to do and need alone time. They also mentioned not wanting the house to look messy.\n3. The partner's family is upset, labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" and a divide has formed.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. The author is setting a boundary about their personal space and time, which is a valid concern. The partner's family considers it rude to not want unannounced visits. But respecting someone else's home and their need for privacy should be mutual. \n\nThe author didn't say they never want guests, just that they prefer not to have unexpected ones. The partner's family might not be respecting the author's living space, which is part of the shared home. The author's statement about the house being as much theirs as the partner's is a fair point. \n\nThe family's reaction might be more about their own expectations not being met rather than the author being in the wrong. The author's right to have personal time and space isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries.\n"
