I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy meal. During the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author explained they don't like that because they might have things to do and sometimes want a day to themselves. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's family now thinks they're being aggressive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal preference. They mentioned it's their home too, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author isn't comfortable with it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their needs. It's important in relationships to communicate your boundaries, especially regarding your personal space. The partner might not have considered the author's perspective, assuming that because they're a couple, the author should be okay with their family's traditions. However, the author's reaction is about respecting their own needs and the home they share. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but is now expressing them shows they're trying to be honest, which is necessary for a healthy relationship. The partner's family's reaction to labeling the author as aggressive seems dismissive of their legitimate concerns. So, the author isn't wrong here; they're standing up for their own preferences in a shared living space.\n"
