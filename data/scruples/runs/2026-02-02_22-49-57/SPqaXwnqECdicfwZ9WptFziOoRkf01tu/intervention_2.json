I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. So the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland. They had a fancy dinner where the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. They expressed their discomfort, mentioning they need time to themselves and don't want the house to be messy. Now there's a divide, and the partner is saying it's not fair that her family can't just drop by. The author is labeled as aggressive for not usually sharing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are communication and boundaries. The author is stating their preferences in their own home. Since it's their house too, they have the right to set boundaries. The partner's family's expectation to drop by without notice might not consider the author's needs. The author's response seems reasonable\u2014they're not against the idea but prefer to have control over their time and space. The partner's reaction is that it's unfair, but the author is asserting their share of the household. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If someone lives in a house, they should have the right to communicate their comfort levels. The problem might be more on the partner's side for not respecting the author's perspective. The author was upfront about their feelings, which is healthy communication. Being labeled as aggressive is a bit unfair because they\u2019re just stating their needs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid point about needing personal space and time, and it's reasonable to set boundaries in one's home. The partner's family's expectations might not align with the author's, but that doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their needs.\n"
