I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests during a post-trip meal, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they're not a fan of surprise visits because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also pointed out that the house might not always be presentable. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the author's boundaries are causing tension.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and shared living space. The author is part of a relationship, but the house is described as \"just as much my house as it hers.\" So, if they live together, the author has a right to set boundaries. However, if the house is only the partner's family home, maybe the dynamics are different. But the post says it's their house, implying they live together.\n\nThe partner is upset that the author is against the surprise visits, while the author is defending their need for personal space. The author's family is calling them \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a misunderstanding of their need for boundaries.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for wanting control over their home. Surprises can be nice, but they can also be stressful, especially when people aren't planning or respecting someone else's schedule. The author is setting a boundary, which is a reasonable thing to do in a shared home. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations if the author is living there too.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to set boundaries in their shared living space.\n"
