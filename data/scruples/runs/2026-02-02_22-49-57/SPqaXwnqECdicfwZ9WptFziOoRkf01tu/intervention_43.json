I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests in their home.\n\nFirst, the author shares a disagreement with their partner and her family about surprise visits. The author isn't against the idea entirely but points out that they might have things to do and value alone time. They also mention the state of the house, which is a valid concern for many people.\n\nThe partner and her family see these surprise visits as nice, but the author feels it's important to set boundaries. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author expressed their feelings calmly, explaining their reasons. They didn't attack the family's habits outright but made it clear that they have needs too. \n\nThe partner is upset because she feels it's unfair for her family not to visit, but the author is standing up for their share of the household. The author's home is a shared space, so having input on who comes in when makes sense. Being labeled as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from the partner feeling her family's traditions are being challenged, but the author's tone was measured. \n\nIt seems like a communication issue rather than the author being in the wrong. Everyone has different social needs, and setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The author is advocating for their personal space, which is reasonable. The real issue might be the partner not recognizing that the author's perspective is valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs and wanting to maintain their space in the home they share.\n"
