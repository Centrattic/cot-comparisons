I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests showing up at their house. The person's partner and her family are okay with it, but the author isn't. The author expressed their discomfort, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural differences. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is normal, but the author's issue is about personal space and time. They mentioned needing to do things or have a day to themselves. That's reasonable. The author also pointed out that it's their house too, which is a valid point because it's a shared space, so both parties have to respect each other's preferences.\n\nThe partner's family is labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually don't voice their opinions. But the author is finally expressing their genuine feelings. That might be causing friction, but it's not necessarily wrong. People do have a right to set boundaries, especially in a shared living space. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs.\n\nThe partner is defending her family's behavior, but maybe they haven't considered the author's perspective. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue might be that the partner's family didn't expect this stance, but it's not unjustified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their personal space and should be able to voice their preferences without being criticized.\n"
