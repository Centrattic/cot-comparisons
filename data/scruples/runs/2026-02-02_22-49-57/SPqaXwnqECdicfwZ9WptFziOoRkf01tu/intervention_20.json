I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expressing discomfort with unexpected guests, leading to tension with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner had just returned from a trip and had a nice meal planned. The topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up without notice came up. The author stated they don't like unexpected visitors because they might be busy or want alone time, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone drops by. This led to a conflict, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the parents labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nI need to consider boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their own boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do. Everyone has the right to personal space and to manage their own home. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common, but that doesn't invalidate the author's feelings. The key point is whether expressing a preference for not having unexpected guests is wrong. \n\nThe author didn't say anything aggressive; they explained their reasons calmly. The conflict arose because the partner and her family didn't anticipate this resistance. The author's stance is about mutual respect\u2014since it's their house as well, they have the right to set expectations. It's about balancing different family customs with individual needs. The partner's family might be in the wrong for not respecting the author's boundaries once they've been communicated. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for stating their preferences. They're advocating for their own comfort, which is valid. The real issue is the partner and her family not considering the author's perspective. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
