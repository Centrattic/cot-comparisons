I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need time to themselves and might have things to do. The partner and family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive. Now there's a divide because the author's house is also their partner's, and the family thinks the author is being aggressive for finally speaking up.\n\nSo, the main issue is about boundaries and differing social norms. The author is setting a boundary by not wanting unannounced visitors. The partner and family might not respect that boundary, thinking it's okay to drop by without notice. The author's argument is that it's their home too, so guests should be announced. The partner's family is upset that the author didn't keep quiet before, leading to the label of \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nFrom a typical perspective, when someone lives in a home, they have the right to set boundaries about visitors. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy and control over their space. The partner's family might not have considered the author's need for personal time and preparation for unexpected guests. The conflict arises because the author finally expressed their feelings, which the family wasn't expecting. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the conversation differently, perhaps with more sensitivity to the partner's feelings. But the core issue is about differing expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for stating their needs, especially since it's their home as well. The family's reaction might stem from not respecting that boundary. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
