I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. \n\nFirst, the author is sharing a situation where they, their partner, and her family returned from a trip. They had a pre-booked meal at a fancy restaurant to wrap up the holiday. During the meal, the conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author isn't a fan, explaining they might have things to do or need a day alone and that the house should be presentable. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the parents labeling the author as aggressive.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author expressed their discomfort with unexpected guests, stating their need for personal time and the importance of the house being in order. The partner and her family see this as a negative, while the author feels justified in their stance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their right to have their home and personal time respected. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries about unexpected guests, especially in their own home. The partner's family might have different social norms, but the author has every right to express their preferences. The author didn't act out aggressively beyond stating their opinion, so being labeled as aggressive seems unfair. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not understanding or respecting the author's boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that her family's traditions are being dismissed. However, the author is part of the household now, so their input should be considered. The conflict arises from clashing expectations. The author isn't wrong for wanting to establish boundaries; it's about mutual adjustment. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their preferences and setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
