I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and her family came back from Iceland. They had a fancy dinner planned, and during the conversation, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed disapproval, saying they don't like it because they might have things to do or need some alone time. The partner and her family think it's a nice surprise, but the author's comments caused a divide. The partner is now saying it's unfair for the family not to be able to show up whenever, and the author's partner's family is calling them \"aggressively opinionated.\" The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, dropping by unannounced is common and seen as friendly. However, in others, it's considered disrespectful to not call first. The author's partner's family might be coming from the former perspective, while the author is from the latter. The author is sharing their house with their partner's family, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner, on the other hand, might feel that her family is part of their household since it's her house as well.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author expressed their feelings, which led to conflict. But the partner's family might not be used to having their unannounced visits questioned. The author's partner is in the middle, trying to balance both sides. The author's stance is about needing personal space and not wanting to be disturbed, which is a valid need. However, the way the author communicated this could be seen as dismissive of the partner's family's customs. \n\nIs the author wrong for not liking unexpected guests? Well, everyone has different preferences. The author isn't wrong for having their own feelings. However, the conflict arises because the partner's family is used to a different norm. The problem might be more about the partner's family's expectations versus the author's boundaries. The author is standing up for their space, which is reasonable. The partner's family might be overreacting because they're not used to having their habits challenged.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because everyone has the right to set boundaries in their home. The author is advocating for their own needs, which is appropriate, even if it causes tension. The partner's family's reaction might be due to a cultural difference or lack of understanding of the author's perspective.\n"
