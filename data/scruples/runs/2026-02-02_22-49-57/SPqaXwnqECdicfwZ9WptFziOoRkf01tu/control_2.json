I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, especially since they had a pre-booked meal after a trip. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author lives in a shared home with their partner's family, so boundaries are important. The partner's family is used to dropping by without notice, but the author prefers having control over their time and space. The author's main points are about needing personal time and not wanting unexpected visits that might disrupt their plans or chores. \n\nThe partner is mediating between her parents' expectations and her partner's preferences. The author's response was direct but not aggressive, just stating their needs. The family took offense, calling the author \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a misunderstanding. The key here is whether the author overstepped by asserting their boundaries or if the family is being unreasonable by not respecting those boundaries.\n\nIn many relationships, communication about personal space and expectations is crucial. The author isn't being hostile but is advocating for their own comfort. The family's expectation of surprise visits might be more about their own social habits than considering others' needs. The author's stance is reasonable because it's their home too, and boundaries should be mutual. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their need for privacy and control over their schedule. The answer should be B.\n"
