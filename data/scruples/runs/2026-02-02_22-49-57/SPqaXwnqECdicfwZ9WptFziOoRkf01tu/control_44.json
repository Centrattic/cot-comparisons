I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They just got back from a trip and had a planned meal. The discussion arose about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed that they don't like this because they might have things to do and need some alone time. The partner's family is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author is now seen as aggressive for speaking up.\n\nFirst, the key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is stating their preferences, which is a normal thing to do. They mentioned that the house is as much theirs as the partner's, which is valid because if they live together, both should have input on how the home is managed. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common, but that doesn't override the author's right to set boundaries. The author hasn't done anything wrong by expressing their discomfort. The partner's family's reaction seems to stem from not respecting the author's perspective, which is their issue, not the author's. The author is in the right for asserting their needs, especially when it comes to their own space and time. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
