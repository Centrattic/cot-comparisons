I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not liking unexpected guests. They had a disagreement with their partner's family about unannounced visits.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and partner had a pre-booked dinner after a trip. The topic came up when discussing the partner's parents and friends showing up without notice. The author expressed discomfort, mentioning wanting personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. The partner and family see it as a nice surprise, but the author feels it's intrusive.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author is in a relationship with their partner, and they share a home. The argument is about respecting personal space and preferences. The author made their feelings known, which is reasonable. The partner's family might not realize the impact of their actions, especially if they're used to a different way of doing things. \n\nThe partner is defending her family, but the author is asserting their own needs. The key here is mutual respect. If the author lives in the same house as the partner, they have a right to set boundaries. The family might be used to a more open lifestyle, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting privacy. \n\nThe family labeling the author as aggressive could be a misunderstanding. The author was expressing their opinion, which is valid. The issue is more about differing expectations rather than right or wrong. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking balance. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They communicated their needs, and it's important for the partner's family to respect that. The conflict arises from a clash in social norms, but the author isn't at fault for wanting personal space.\n"
