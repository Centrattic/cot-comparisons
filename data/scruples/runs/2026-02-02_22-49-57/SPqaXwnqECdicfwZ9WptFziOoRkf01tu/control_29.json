I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves them not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person is sharing their home with their partner's family, and the partner's parents and friends drop by as surprises. The person doesn't like this because they might be busy or need alone time, and they also don't want the house to be messy when unexpected guests come. The partner is upset, thinking it's unfair, and the family now sees the author as too opinionated.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for expressing their discomfort. In terms of rights, people should be able to set boundaries in their home. It's common to have different social preferences. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The partner's family might have different expectations, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is asserting their space and needs, which is reasonable. The partner's family's surprise visits could be seen as intrusive, especially if not discussed beforehand. The author's response was to express their viewpoint, which is valid. The partner's family's reaction suggests they didn't consider the author's perspective. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their own needs and boundaries in their shared home.\n"
