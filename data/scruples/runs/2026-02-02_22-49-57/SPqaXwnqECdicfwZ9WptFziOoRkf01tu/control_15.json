I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them disagreeing with their partner's family about unexpected guests.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author and their partner had a pre-booked meal after returning from Iceland. The topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced came up. The author expressed disapproval, stating they don't like surprises because they might have things to do and need alone time. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the author's house is a shared space, so they feel it's their right to have control over their time and space.\n\nThe key points here are the author's boundaries versus the partner's family's expectations. The author is asserting their need for personal space and time, which is a common boundary. The partner is defending her family's behavior, possibly not recognizing the author's legitimate need for privacy. The author's response was direct but not aggressive, and the family is now labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated,\" which might be a deflection or misunderstanding.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here unless there's a specific agreement about guests. Socially, it's about mutual respect. The author is entitled to their preferences. The conflict arises from differing values: spontaneous visits vs. planned time. The author isn't being unreasonable by expressing their discomfort. The family's reaction could be due to not considering the author's perspective. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is valid if they live there. The main issue is communication and respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries.\n"
