I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland. They had a booked fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the dinner, the conversation turned to the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced as surprises. The partner and her sister like this, but the author didn't. The author explained they prefer having a day to themselves without unexpected visitors and don't want the house to be messy if people come suddenly. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's opinion has led to being labeled as aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is expressing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a valid personal boundary. The partner's family seems to have different expectations. The author didn't overreact; they provided reasonable reasons like needing personal time and not wanting the house to be in disarray. The partner's family might be used to a different social norm where surprise visits are common, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for having their own preferences. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not necessarily from the author being in the wrong. The author is standing up for their space in a shared home, which is their right. The partner's family's reaction seems more about their own discomfort with the author's honesty than the author's fault. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
