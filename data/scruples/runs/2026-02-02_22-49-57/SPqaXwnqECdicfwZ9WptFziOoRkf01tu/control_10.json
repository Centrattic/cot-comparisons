I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves their partner's family dropping by unannounced. The key points here are communication and boundaries.\n\nThe author expressed their discomfort with surprise visits, explaining that they might have tasks or need personal time. They also mentioned the house state, which is a valid concern. The partner's family sees these visits as nice surprises, but the author clearly states it's their house too and they should respect that.\n\nIn relationships, especially with in-laws or extended family, setting boundaries is important. The author tried to communicate their feelings, which is reasonable. The partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from not respecting those boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting space; it's about mutual respect. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
