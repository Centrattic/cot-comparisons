I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland. They had a booked fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the dinner, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced at each other's houses. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author explained that they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and don't want the house to look messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is saying it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author's been labeled as aggressive by the partner's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. The author is setting a boundary about unexpected guests, which is a personal space issue. The partner's family might have different social norms where dropping by without notice is considered friendly. The author's response was to express their dislike and explain their reasons, which is reasonable. However, the partner is now taking the author's side in the argument, maybe not seeing the other perspective. \n\nBut the author is in a committed relationship with the partner, and the house is shared. So the author has every right to express that their space and personal time matter. The issue arises when the partner's family is upset because they feel their usual social habits are being criticized. The author's statement about the house being in a state might come off as critical of their hosting, which could explain the parents' reaction. However, the author is just stating their preference, not attacking anyone. \n\nThe partner is caught in the middle, trying to balance both sides. The author's response might not have been aggressive, but the partner's family might not be used to someone setting such boundaries. In relationships, it's important to communicate needs clearly. The author did communicate their feelings, which is right. The conflict is more about differing expectations rather than the author being wrong. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their personal space and to express that without being labeled aggressive. The partner and her family need to respect the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
