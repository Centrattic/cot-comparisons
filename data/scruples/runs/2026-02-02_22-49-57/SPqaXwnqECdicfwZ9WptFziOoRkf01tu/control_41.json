I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who have a tradition of showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's stance is reasonable. The key points are: the author wasn't against the idea of surprises entirely but mentioned needing personal space and time to get things done. They also mentioned the state of the house. These are valid concerns because unexpected guests can disrupt someone's schedule and personal time, and not everyone is comfortable with surprise visits.\n\nThe partner's family might see this as being overly cautious or unwelcoming, but the author's right to set boundaries in their own home is important. The partner's reaction suggests she might not fully understand her partner's perspective, possibly leading her to side with her family. However, the author didn't say they were against all social interactions; they just wanted to set limits. \n\nThe author's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from surprise or discomfort with the author expressing their opinion, especially if they usually hold back. But expressing a legitimate concern isn't aggression. \n\nIn relationships, especially when merging with another family, setting boundaries is crucial. The author isn't wrong for asserting their needs in their own home. The conflict arises from differing social norms and expectations. The author isn't at fault for not liking unexpected guests; they have a right to their space and preferences. So the answer is B.\n"
