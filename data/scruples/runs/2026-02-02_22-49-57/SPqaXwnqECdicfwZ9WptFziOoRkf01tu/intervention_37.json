I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The key points are that they were discussing the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced as a \"nice surprise,\" but the author expressed their dislike for that. The partner and family don't agree, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author lives with their partner, so their home is shared. The author's concern about needing personal space and time to get things done is valid. It's reasonable to want some control over one's living space and schedule. Expressing this shouldn't be considered aggressive unless the way it was communicated was hostile. The author mentioned they usually bite their tongue, so this was a rare moment of expressing their opinion.\n\nThe partner's family might feel their traditions or social habits are being challenged. But the author has every right to set boundaries, especially in their shared home. The partner's response that it's unfair suggests a lack of understanding from the family side. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is a reasonable assertion of ownership and personal space.\n\nThere's no indication the author acted out of malice or without cause. They simply communicated their needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The family's reaction of labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might stem from discomfort with the new boundary rather than the content of the message. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their personal time and space. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
