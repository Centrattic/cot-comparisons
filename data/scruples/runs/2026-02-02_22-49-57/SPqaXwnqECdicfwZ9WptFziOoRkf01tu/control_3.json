I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner came back from a trip and had a planned meal. During the conversation, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. They also mentioned the house might not be in order for unexpected visits. Now, the partner's family is upset, saying the author is being aggressive for sharing their opinion.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: the author is sharing their legitimate feelings about needing privacy and space. They didn't want to burst into the conversation but finally spoke up. The partner's family isn't respecting their boundaries, which is a problem. The author owns the house as well, so it's reasonable to set rules about visitors. The partner's family is labeling the author as aggressive for stating their preferences, which isn't fair if the author is respectful.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. It's important for all parties to communicate and find a middle ground. The partner and family might need to adjust their expectations, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
