I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner's family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner had a disagreement about surprise visits. The author expressed their discomfort, explaining that they might have things to do or need alone time. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The partner is upset because the author didn't like their family's habit, and the author is defending their own space.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is not, but they're asking for confirmation. Let's break it down. \n\nExpressing personal boundaries is generally acceptable. The author mentioned that the house is \"just as much theirs as it is hers,\" which is a valid point. People have different preferences about social interactions, and it's reasonable to want some control over one's living space. The partner's family might not realize that the author has different needs or that their behavior is intrusive. \n\nHowever, the way the author communicated their feelings could be a factor. They said they usually bite their tongue, which suggests they might not have addressed this before. The partner feels that it's unfair now to bring it up, but the author's perspective is about respecting their space. There's a conflict between family traditions and individual boundaries. \n\nThe label of \"aggressively opinionated\" from the partner's family might be a misunderstanding. The author's response was about setting a boundary, not being aggressive. Unless the author was hostile, which isn't indicated here, their stance is justified. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set personal boundaries in their home. The partner and her family need to respect that. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
