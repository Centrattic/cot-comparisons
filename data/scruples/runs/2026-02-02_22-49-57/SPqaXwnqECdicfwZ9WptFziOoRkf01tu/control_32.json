I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who frequently drop by unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort with this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are about needing personal space and time to themselves, and the issue of the house being in a certain state when guests show up. They mentioned the house is shared, so they feel it's important that their preferences are considered. The partner's family sees it as a nice surprise, but the author isn't a fan. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect in a shared living situation. Both sides have valid points. The family might see unannounced visits as friendly, but the author has a right to their own space and privacy. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their boundaries. The partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair since they're just expressing their feelings. \n\nIn relationships, especially with extended family, communication is key. The author tried to communicate their feelings, which is the right approach. The partner's side not respecting that could be the real issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs in a shared home.\n"
