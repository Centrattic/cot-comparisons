I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy meal. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author expressed discomfort, mentioning needing time to themselves and not wanting the house to look messy. This caused a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's partner's family labeled them as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to agree or disagree. \n\nKey points here: The author is sharing their genuine feelings about needing personal space and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to want privacy, especially if you're not used to the family's habits. The partner and family seem to not respect the author's boundaries, expecting the same level of openness. \n\nThe author's response was to explain their perspective, not to attack. They mentioned their needs without being confrontational. The partner and her family's reaction\u2014labeling them as aggressive\u2014seems unfair. The author is asserting their own home's boundaries, which is valid. \n\nNo one is in the wrong for having different expectations. The problem here is more about differing values and communication. The author isn't wrong for expressing their discomfort. The partner's family might be wrong for not respecting that. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
