I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They're in a relationship with their partner, and there's a conflict between their preferences and the partner's family's habits. The partner's family and parents just show up unannounced, which the author doesn't like. The author expressed their feelings, saying they need personal time and don't want the house messy. The partner is upset, thinking it's unfair, and the author's being seen as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When you're in a relationship, especially living together, you have shared space and shared family. The author is asserting their personal boundaries, which is important. People have different comfort levels with social interactions. Not wanting surprise guests isn't unreasonable. The author explained their reasons: needing to do things, having a day to themselves, and not wanting the house messy. Those are valid concerns. \n\nBut the partner's family sees it as a nice surprise. However, if the author's partner expects them to host or be available, that's a different angle. The key here is mutual respect. The author tried to communicate their feelings without being aggressive, just stating their preferences. The partner and her family might not be respecting those boundaries, leading to conflict.\n\nThe partner is defending her family, saying it's unfair. But the author is part of the household, so their needs should be considered. The author didn't say they can't come over at all, just not without notice. That seems reasonable. The parents labeling the author as aggressive might be a defense mechanism to protect their own behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The partner and her family might need to adjust. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
