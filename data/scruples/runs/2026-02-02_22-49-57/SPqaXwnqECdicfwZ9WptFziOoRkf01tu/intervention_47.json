I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo the author, their partner, and the partner's family came back from Iceland. They had a fancy dinner planned, and during the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and friends often show up unannounced. The author didn't like that idea, explaining they might have things to do and sometimes want a day to themselves. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people drop by. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair, and the author's point of being more reserved in sharing opinions has led to being labeled as aggressive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and shared living space. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits. It's their home too, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might have different social norms, expecting flexibility, but the author is asserting their own needs. The partner is caught between two sides, feeling that the family can't just show up whenever, but also feeling that the author is being too strict. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting their boundaries. Everyone has the right to personal space and privacy. The partner's family might not realize that the author's home is also their space. The author didn't say it's completely off-limits, just that they might need time to themselves and not want to be interrupted. The partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but the author's stance is about mutual respect for each other's needs. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're standing up for their own needs in a shared living situation. The partner and family might need to adjust their expectations. The author isn't being aggressive; they're just communicating their preferences clearly now, which is important for healthy relationships.\n"
