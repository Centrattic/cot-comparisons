I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who are okay with showing up unannounced. The author expressed their dislike for this, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared household, so their feelings about unannounced visits are valid. Everyone has a right to personal space and time, so the author's stance isn't unreasonable. The partner's family might be used to a different dynamic, but that doesn't make the author wrong for setting boundaries. The key here is mutual respect. The author is asserting their space, which is important in any shared living situation. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that family traditions are being challenged, but the author has a right to their own preferences. The accusation of being \"aggressively opinionated\" could be a defense mechanism from the partner's family. Overall, the author isn't being unreasonable; they're communicating their needs. So the answer is B.\n"
