I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and her family. After a trip to Iceland, they had a meal at a fancy restaurant. They discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced as a surprise.\n\nThe partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author expressed that they might have things to do and prefer some alone time, also mentioning the house might not be tidy. Now there's a divide because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the author's family labels them as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, consider boundaries in relationships. When two people live together or in a committed relationship, they should respect each other's preferences. The author is asserting their right to have space and control over their home. It's reasonable to want to prepare for guests and not be caught off guard with unfinished tasks or needing alone time.\n\nThe partner's family might see dropping by without notice as a sign of closeness and spontaneity, which is common in some cultures or families. However, the author's concerns are valid. No one should feel pressured to allow unexpected visitors if it disrupts their routine or personal time. The author isn't being hostile; they're setting boundaries. The partner's reaction and the family's labeling the author as aggressive suggests they're not respecting the author's needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for wanting to control their living environment. They expressed their feelings calmly, pointing out the potential for unfinished tasks and the need for personal days. The partner's side might need to adjust their expectations to respect their partner's boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
