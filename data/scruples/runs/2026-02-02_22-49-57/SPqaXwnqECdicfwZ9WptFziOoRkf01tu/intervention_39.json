I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which has caused a conflict with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked nice meal. During this meal, the topic of the partner's parents and friends showing up unexpectedly came up. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't. The author explained they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves, and that they wouldn't want the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair, and the author's opinion causing them to be labeled as \"aggressively opinionated.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points are the author's right to privacy and personal space in their home, and the partner's family's expectation of being able to drop by. The author is sharing their genuine feelings, which is reasonable. The partner's family might be used to a certain dynamic, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set boundaries. \n\nThe argument is about differing values: some people enjoy spontaneous visits, while others prefer to plan. The author isn't being aggressive; they're expressing their preference. The partner's family might feel disrespected, but that's their interpretation. The author is in a shared home, so they have a right to input. The partner is caught in the middle, trying to balance both sides. \n\nThe author's statement about the house being theirs as much as the partner's is valid. If the partner's family is unannounced, it's a matter of respecting the household's rules. The author's stance isn't unreasonable. The family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a reaction to the author finally speaking up after usually holding back. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries, which is healthy. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but that doesn't make the author the asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
