I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests.\n\nSo, the setup is that the author, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up as surprises. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. The author explained that they don't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes need a day to themselves. They also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if people show up unannounced. This led to a divide, with the partner feeling it's unfair and the author's partner's family labeling them as aggressively opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal boundaries and shared living spaces. The author is expressing discomfort with unexpected guests. They have a valid reason: needing personal time and not wanting their home to be unprepared. It's their house as much as their partner's, so they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nThe partner's family seems to have different social norms where showing up unannounced is considered a nice surprise. However, the author isn't the one showing up unannounced; they're the host here. The conflict arises from clashing expectations. The author isn't being inconsiderate by stating their preferences. In fact, they're trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable in a relationship. \n\nThe partner and her family's reaction, labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated,\" seems unfair. Expressing a preference isn't aggression unless done confrontationally. The author mentioned they usually bite their tongue, which suggests they've been holding back, so this isn't an out-of-nowhere complaint. \n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. The author is asserting their space, which is justified. The partner's side isn't respecting the author's need for privacy and preparation. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're standing up for their own needs in a shared living situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
