I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland. They had a fancy dinner planned to wrap up the trip. During the meal, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced at each other's houses. The partner and her sister like these surprises, but the author doesn't. They expressed that they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and also mentioned the house being messy. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair that her family can't just drop by. The author emphasized that the house is as much theirs as the partner's, and they're being labeled as aggressive by the partner's parents because they usually don't share their opinions.\n\nSo the main issue here is about boundaries and differing opinions on unannounced visits. The author is defending their need for personal space and time, which seems reasonable. The partner and her family value spontaneity and surprise visits, but the author is uncomfortable with that. The author's response was to state their preference, which is a valid way to set boundaries. However, the partner is taking it as unfair, implying that the author is being restrictive. The key here is mutual respect. If the author's partner and her family consider the house as a shared space, they should respect the author's boundaries. The author is not wrong for expressing their feelings, especially if they were previously holding back. The partner's family's criticism of the author's \"aggressiveness\" might be an overreaction, as the author is just stating their needs. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their personal space and their feelings should be respected.\n"
