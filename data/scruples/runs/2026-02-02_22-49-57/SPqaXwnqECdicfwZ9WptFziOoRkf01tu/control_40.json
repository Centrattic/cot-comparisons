I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. The main conflict arises from the author expressing discomfort with surprise visits from the partner's parents and their friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural differences. In some cultures, dropping by without notice is common, seen as a gesture of closeness. However, the author is clearly stating their boundaries, which is important for personal space and autonomy. The partner's family seems to view this as a problem, suggesting they might not respect those boundaries. \n\nThe author's main points are about needing personal time and not wanting unannounced visits. They also mention the state of the house, which is a valid concern. The partner is taking the family's side, implying the author is being unreasonable. But the author is asserting their own needs, which is not inherently wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. They expressed their feelings without aggression, as far as the description goes. The partner's family labels them as \"aggressively opinionated,\" but the author was just stating their preferences. The house being shared means both parties should respect each other's preferences. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The issue lies in the partner's family not respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
