I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests.\n\nThe author's partner and her family like to surprise each other by showing up unannounced. The author doesn't like this because they might be busy or need alone time. The partner's family is now upset, thinking the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to want to have their own space and time. The author is expressing that they need privacy, which is a valid concern. The partner's family might not realize that their actions are crossing a boundary the author has set.\n\nThe author mentioned that they usually keep their opinions to themselves, so this was a rare instance where they spoke up. That suggests they're trying to communicate their needs, which is important for healthy relationships. The partner is taking it as a problem because her family can't just come over, but the author is standing up for their own needs.\n\nThe author's statement about the house being their home as well is key. It's about shared space and mutual respect. The family's reaction of labeling the author as aggressive seems unfair if the author is just asserting their rights in a shared living space.\n\nI think the author is in the right here. They're setting boundaries and expressing their needs, which is necessary for a balanced relationship. The partner and her family need to adjust to the author's preferences. So the answer should be B.\n"
