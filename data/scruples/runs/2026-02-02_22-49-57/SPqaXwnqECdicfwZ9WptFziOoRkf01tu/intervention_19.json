I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed disliking this because they might have things to do or want alone time. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author is firm about it. Now there's tension because the author's house is supposed to be shared, and the family feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is setting a boundary about uninvited guests, which is about personal space and time. The partner's family might not be used to respecting that boundary, especially if they're from a culture where surprise visits are common. The author's point about the house being \"just as much theirs as the partner's\" is valid because shared living spaces require mutual agreement on rules.\n\nThe author usually holds back their opinions around the in-laws, but when they do express their views, they're labeled as aggressive. That's a problem because it dismisses their valid concerns. The partner is caught in the middle, feeling that her family's traditions are being challenged. However, the author has a right to set boundaries in their shared home. The key issue is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since they explained their reasons (personal time, not wanting the house to be messy), it's justified. The partner's family's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's perspective or having different social norms. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. They have a right to their personal space and preferences in a shared living situation. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but the author's position is reasonable and not aggressive if communicated respectfully. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
