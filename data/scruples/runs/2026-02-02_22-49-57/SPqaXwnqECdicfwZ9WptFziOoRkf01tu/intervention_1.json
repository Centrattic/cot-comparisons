I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think it's nice to surprise each other, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and need alone time. The partner is upset because she thinks her family shouldn't be restricted, and the author is defending their space as it's their home too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. Everyone has the right to their personal space and privacy. The author is expressing their discomfort, which is valid. The partner's family might not realize that these surprise visits are intrusive. The author's point about the house being theirs is important too. If they're sharing a home, all residents should have a say in who comes over and when.\n\nThe partner's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's need for privacy. The author usually holds back their opinions but now expressed them, which the in-laws perceive as being aggressive. That's a common issue when long-held boundaries suddenly get voiced. It's not aggression; it's self-advocacy.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is reasonable: having a day to oneself and not wanting the house in disarray if guests show up unannounced. Those are practical concerns. The partner's side might need to adjust their expectations when living with someone else who has different preferences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs in a shared living situation. The real issue might be communication between the partners about these differences. The answer should be B.\n"
