I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think it's okay to show up unannounced, but the author doesn't like that. They had a disagreement after coming back from Iceland, where they had a planned meal. The author expressed their discomfort, and now there's a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they value their personal space, don't like surprises, and want to have control over their home. They mentioned that sometimes they need a day to themselves and that the house might not be ready for guests. That seems reasonable. People have different boundaries, and it's valid to want to set them, especially in one's own home.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family see unexpected visits as a nice surprise. Maybe they come from a culture or family dynamic where that's considered normal. The partner is upset that the author is now setting boundaries, thinking it's unfair. The parents even labeled the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually don't voice their opinions around them. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their right to have their home be a space where they can control who's there. It's not about being in the wrong, but about differing expectations. The author hasn't acted out aggressively beyond expressing their opinion, which is their right. The family's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected or not used to having their habits questioned. \n\nThe divide comes from not aligning on social norms. The author is standing up for their needs, which is a healthy thing. The partner and family need to adjust their expectations. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
