I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are okay with surprise visits. The author expressed discomfort with this, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, cohabitation often involves merging different family dynamics. The author is asserting their right to personal space and control over their home. That seems reasonable. People have different boundaries, and the author isn't wrong for having them. The partner's family might feel entitled because they've always done it that way, but the author's home is now shared, so their boundaries should be respected.\n\nThe author's partner seems to take the side of her family, which might be causing the divide. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being aggressive; they're setting clear, valid boundaries. The partner's family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a misunderstanding. The author's right to have a day to themselves and a tidy home isn't unreasonable. So, the answer should be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
