I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to dropping by unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's partner's family has a habit of surprising each other. The author communicated their dislike for this, explaining they need personal time and that the house should be presentable. The partner feels it's unfair, and the author's family now sees them as too opinionated. The author is labeled as aggressive for not usually sharing their views.\n\nNow, thinking about boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries about their personal space and time. The author is part of a shared home, so their input matters. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author's feelings are invalid. The divide comes from differing expectations.\n\nThe author's response was direct but not hostile. They explained their reasons, which is fair. The partner's family's reaction suggests they weren't expecting that stance. The author isn't wrong for asserting their needs, especially since it's their home too. The issue is more about miscommunication or unmet expectations rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing their preferences. It's a matter of differing values and the need for mutual understanding.\n"
