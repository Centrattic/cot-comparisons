I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the meal, they discussed how the partner's parents and their friends just show up unannounced at each other's houses as a surprise. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do and sometimes want a day to themselves. The author mentioned that they don't want the house to be messy if people drop by. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair that her family can't just show up whenever, and the author's being called aggressively opinionated by the partner's parents.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and how the opinions were expressed. The author is sharing their discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a personal preference. The partner's family seems to have a different cultural or familial norm where showing up unannounced is acceptable. The conflict arises because the author's preference is clashing with the partner's family's habits. \n\nThe author's partner is defending her family's behavior, saying it's unfair to restrict them. The author, on the other hand, is asserting that the house is shared and that they need control over their space. The partner's family is taking offense at the author's directness, labeling him as aggressive. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, everyone has the right to set boundaries in their home. The author is just expressing their need for personal space and time, which is reasonable. However, the way it was communicated might have been a factor. The author mentioned that they usually bite their tongue, so this time they spoke up. The partner and family might not be used to hearing the author's perspective, leading to the conflict. \n\nBut the core issue is about the right to control one's living space. If the author is a cohabitant, it's entirely valid to expect guests to be announced. The partner's family might not realize that this is a shared home now. The partner is caught between her family's traditions and her partner's boundaries. The author isn't necessarily wrong for stating their preferences, especially if the guests are coming to their home uninvited. However, the way it's presented and the family's reaction might indicate a need for better communication or understanding both sides. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for having this opinion. They have a right to their space. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior since it's now a shared home. The partner might need to mediate here to balance both perspectives. The author's statement about the house being theirs as well is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
