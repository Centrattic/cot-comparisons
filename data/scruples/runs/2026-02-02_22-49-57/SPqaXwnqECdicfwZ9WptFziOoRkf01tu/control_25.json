I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests, which caused a conflict with their partner and her family. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author expresses discomfort with surprise visits, mentioning that they might have things to do and need alone time. They also mention that the house isn't always presentable. The partner and her family see the surprise visits as a nice gesture, but the author disagrees. This led to a divide where the partner feels it's unfair, and the family labels the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries and communication. The author is asserting their right to privacy and personal space in their own home. They're not just being rude without reason; they have valid concerns about their schedule and the state of their home. The partner and family, on the other hand, have different social norms regarding unexpected visits. \n\nThe author didn't just lash out; they explained their reasoning. However, the issue is that the partner and family aren't respecting those boundaries. The author is standing up for their space, which is a normal and healthy thing. The partner's reaction suggests that they might not have communicated these expectations earlier, leading to sudden conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If you consider that expressing a preference for not having surprise guests is a reasonable boundary, then no. Everyone has the right to their personal space and privacy. The problem isn't the author's stance but the partner's family not respecting that boundary. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or family tradition here. The partner's family might be used to this kind of thing, so the conflict arises from differing expectations. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're just setting limits. The partner might need to mediate between both sides, but the author isn't the one at fault here. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their legitimate preferences in their own home.\n"
