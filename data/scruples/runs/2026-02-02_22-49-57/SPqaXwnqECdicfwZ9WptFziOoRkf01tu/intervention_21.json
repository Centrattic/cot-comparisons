I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner's family often shows up unannounced, and the author expressed disapproval. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author's point is that it's their house too. The author usually holds back but now spoke up, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When you live with someone, especially their family, you have to respect each other's space. The author is setting a boundary by not wanting unannounced visits. That's reasonable. People have different needs for personal space and time. The partner's family might see it as a cultural or familial norm to drop by, but the author is asserting their right to privacy in their own home.\n\nThe partner is taking the side of her family, which could be a sign of imbalance. The author is correct in pointing out that the house belongs to both of them. If guests are coming without notice, it's a valid concern because it affects the author's ability to manage their time and space. The author's reaction is about maintaining boundaries, which is healthy. The partner's family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" is a deflection, perhaps because they feel guilty about overstepping.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is setting reasonable boundaries, the partner is not respecting those by siding with family, and the author is in the right to defend their space. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
