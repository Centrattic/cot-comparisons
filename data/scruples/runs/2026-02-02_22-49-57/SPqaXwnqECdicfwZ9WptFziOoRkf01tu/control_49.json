I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family think it's nice to show up unannounced, but the author doesn't like that. The author expressed their discomfort, mentioning that they might have things to do and need some alone time. The partner and family are upset, saying it's not fair and that the author is being too aggressive.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is in a relationship with their partner, who has family traditions of dropping by. The author's home is shared with the partner, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might see it as a cultural norm or a friendly gesture, but the author's feelings are valid too. \n\nThe author didn't say anything aggressive initially; they just stated their preferences. The conflict arises because the partner is defending her family's actions without considering the author's need for personal space. The author's house being \"as much theirs as hers\" is important. If the family keeps showing up without notice, it's a boundary issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their personal time and space. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior if the author's needs are to be respected. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
