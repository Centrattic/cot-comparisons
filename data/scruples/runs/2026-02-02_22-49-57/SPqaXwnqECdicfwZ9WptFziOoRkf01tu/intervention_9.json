I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are used to surprise visits. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their feelings about needing personal space and not wanting unannounced visits. They mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions but this time voiced their concern. The partner's family is taking it as being overly opinionated, but the author is standing up for their own needs.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author isn't saying the family's actions are wrong, just that they prefer not to have surprise guests. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries in their own home. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for expressing their preference.\n\nAlso, the author emphasized that the house is shared, implying they have a right to set rules. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not from the author acting inconsiderately. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs, which is important in a relationship.\n"
