I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author's partner and her family usually have friends drop by unannounced, but the author doesn't like it. They had a disagreement after a meal when discussing this. The author's partner is upset, thinking it's unfair, and the partner's parents think the author is being aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. When two people are in a relationship, especially cohabiting, they should respect each other's preferences. The author is expressing their discomfort with unscheduled visits, which is reasonable. The partner and her family might see it as normal, but the author has a valid reason\u2014needing personal time and space.\n\nThe author mentioned they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, which suggests they might have been trying to avoid conflict. By finally expressing their feelings, they're asserting their own needs, which is healthy. The partner's family's reaction of labeling the author as aggressive might be a deflection or not understanding the importance of personal boundaries.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, having different expectations doesn't inherently make someone wrong. The key is whether the author's stance is reasonable. The author's request for privacy and advance notice is a common need. The partner's family's surprise visits could be seen as intrusive. The author isn't rejecting the partner's culture entirely but is asking for mutual respect. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their needs in a shared living situation. The answer should be B.\n"
