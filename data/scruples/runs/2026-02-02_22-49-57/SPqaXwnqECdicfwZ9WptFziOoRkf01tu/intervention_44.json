I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves them disagreeing with their partner's family about unexpected guests.\n\nFirst, the author, their partner, and her family came back from a trip and had a meal. During the meal, they discussed the family's habit of showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister liked it, but the author didn't. He explained he prefers some alone time and not wanting the house to be messy. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair, and the author's partner's family now think he's being aggressive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are personal boundaries and communication. The author is expressing his discomfort with unexpected guests, which is a reasonable request. He's not saying they can never come over, just that he wants to be prepared and have some time to himself. It's about mutual respect for each other's preferences.\n\nThe partner's family might be used to their own dynamics, but moving in together (assuming they live together) means both families have to adjust. The author isn't being hostile; he's clearly stating his needs. The family's reaction to labeling him as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like they're not respecting his boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate needs and expectations. The author did that, even if he usually holds back. The partner's family might need to adjust, and the partner should mediate to ensure both sides are heard. So, the author isn't in the wrong. He's advocating for his personal space, which is valid.\n"
