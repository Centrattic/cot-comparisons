I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had a discussion after a trip about the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with this, explaining they need personal time and don't want the house to be messy. The partner and family are upset, feeling it's unfair, and the author is now seen as too opinionated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared home, so their feelings about unexpected guests are valid. Everyone has different preferences about personal space and privacy. The author isn't wrong for wanting to control their environment. However, the way the conflict arose might matter. Did they communicate their feelings respectfully? The user says they \"just said\" they weren't a fan, which sounds straightforward but maybe could have been handled more tactfully, especially if the partner's family is used to a different norm.\n\nThe partner's family might feel excluded or that their traditions are being challenged. The author's statement about the house being \"just as much theirs\" is important because it's a shared living space. Respecting each other's boundaries is key here. The partner might feel that the author is overreacting, but the author isn't wrong for having those boundaries. The family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misunderstanding or defensiveness from the family's side. \n\nIn relationships, especially with in-laws, communication styles and cultural differences can play a role. The author might need to find a middle ground, like discussing a policy for guests, but they aren't wrong for expressing their discomfort. There's no indication the author is being unreasonable; they just want their space respected. The partner's family might not be considering the author's perspective, leading to conflict. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
