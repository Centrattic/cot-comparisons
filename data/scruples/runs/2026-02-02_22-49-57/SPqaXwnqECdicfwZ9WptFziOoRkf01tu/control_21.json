I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that after a trip, they had dinner and discussed the partner's parents' habit of showing up unannounced. The author expressed discomfort with that, mentioning needing personal time and not wanting the house to be messy. The partner and her family are upset, saying it's unfair and that the author is being aggressive for finally speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess boundaries. The house is shared, so the author has a right to set boundaries. People have different comfort levels with spontaneity. The partner's family might see it as friendly surprise, but others might find it intrusive. The author isn't forbidding guests entirely, just expressing a preference. They even mentioned not usually sharing opinions, so it's not like they're being confrontational. The family's reaction seems harsh. The key points are mutual respect and communication. Since the house is shared, both sides should respect each other's preferences. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
