I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland. They had a pre-booked fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and their friends showing up unexpectedly. The partner and sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it because they might have things to do, want alone time, or not want the house messy. The partner is upset, saying it's not fair, and the author is labeled as aggressive for finally sharing their opinion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. \n\nFrom what I see, the author is expressing a legitimate concern about personal space and autonomy. They mentioned wanting alone time and being prepared for unexpected guests. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially regarding one's home. The partner's family's expectation to drop by without notice might be a cultural or generational difference. The author's house is shared with the partner, so they have a right to voice their preferences. The partner's reaction and the parents' labeling the author as aggressive suggests a lack of understanding of the author's needs.\n\nI don't see the author overstepping. They're asserting their feelings respectfully. The issue is more about differing expectations. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
