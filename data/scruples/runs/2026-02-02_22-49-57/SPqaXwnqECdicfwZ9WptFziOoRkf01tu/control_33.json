I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about unexpected guests. The author, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a fancy dinner. They discussed the partner's parents and their friends dropping by as a surprise. The author didn't like that idea, explained they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and mentioned not wanting the house messy. Now there's a conflict because the partner thinks it's unfair, and the partner's parents think the author is too aggressive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Hmm. First, the author is expressing their boundaries. They have a right to want privacy and not have unexpected guests. The partner's family's behavior is about showing up without notice, which can be intrusive. The author's response was to share their feelings, which is reasonable. The partner is defending her family, but the author is part of the household now. The house shouldn't just be the partner's family's space. The author's comment about the house being as much theirs is valid. The partner's family might not consider that. The author wasn't aggressive; they were stating their preferences. The parents labeling them as aggressively opinionated seems unfair. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
