I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation is that the author, their partner, and her family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. The author didn't like the idea of unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need alone time, and mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now the partner's family is upset, calling the author aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author is sharing their home, which they consider their own as much as the partner's. The partner's family has a culture of showing up unexpectedly, which the author finds inconvenient. The author expressed their discomfort in a calm way, explaining their reasons. The partner is now defending her family's habits, leading to a conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in terms of personal boundaries, it's reasonable for someone to want control over their space and time. The author didn't act out, just expressed their opinion. The partner's family might be used to different norms, but that doesn't make the author's stance invalid. The key here is mutual respect. The author has the right to set boundaries in a shared living space. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author was respectful in their communication. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
