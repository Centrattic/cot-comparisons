I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about unexpected guests. The author's partner and her family like to drop by each other's houses as a surprise, but the author doesn't like that. After a trip, they discussed it, and the author expressed their dislike, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a partner in a relationship, sharing a house with their partner's family. They're saying it's not just the partner's home anymore but theirs too. The author's concern is valid because unexpected guests can disrupt plans and make someone uncomfortable. The partner's side might see it as a cultural or family tradition, like maybe being more social or spontaneous.\n\nThe author's response was to state their opinion, which is reasonable. They didn't attack the family but explained their reasons. The partner's family labeled them as aggressive, which might be a defensive reaction. The partner is defending her family's habits but also needs to acknowledge her partner's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting their right to have space in their own home, which is a basic need. The partner's family might not have considered that perspective before. The fact that the author usually holds their tongue but now spoke up shows they're trying to communicate their needs, which is healthy in a relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The partner's family might feel disrespected, but the author has the right to their own space. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
