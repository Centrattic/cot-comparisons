      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they and their partner just came back from Iceland, and they had a fancy dinner planned. During the meal, the partner and her sister mentioned how their parents and friends drop by each other's houses unannounced. The author said they don't like that because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset because she thinks it's not fair that her family can't just drop by, and the author is being called aggressive for expressing their opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is expressing their dislike for unexpected guests. They provided reasons: needing to do things, wanting some alone time, and not wanting the house to be in a state (probably messy or unprepared). The partner's family has a different norm, where dropping by without notice is seen as a nice surprise. The author is now labeled as being aggressive, even though they usually don't voice their opinions around the family.\n\nSo, the main issue is about boundaries and differing social norms. The author has a right to their own space and time. When someone has a pre-booked meal and is coming back from a trip, they might need rest or privacy. The partner's family, however, might not be used to setting up appointments or giving prior notice for visits. The author's response was straightforward but maybe a bit direct, especially since they mentioned the house being messy, which can come off as a critique of the family's habits.\n\nThe partner is mediating between her family's expectations and the author's preferences. The author's statement about the house being their home as well is valid because if they live there, it's their space too. But maybe the way it was said could be seen as a bit confrontational, especially if the family is used to being more flexible and the author's comments feel like they're imposing new rules. The partner's family might feel their way of life is being criticized, leading to the \"aggressively opinionated\" label.\n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong for having these feelings. It's reasonable to want to set boundaries after a trip, especially if they have plans or need downtime. The partner's family might need to adjust their behavior, and the author should feel comfortable expressing their needs. The fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but this time didn't might have caused the tension, but that doesn't make them wrong. They are asserting their right to privacy and personal space, which is important in a relationship. The partner's family should respect that, even if it's different from their usual practices.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their preferences and the house is shared, so both parties need to find a middle ground. The family shouldn't expect unannounced visits if the other person finds it intrusive. The author's honesty, though it caused a divide, is justified.\n"
