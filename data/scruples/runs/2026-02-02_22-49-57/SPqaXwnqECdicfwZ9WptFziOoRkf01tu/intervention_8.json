I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author, their partner, and her family just returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy dinner to wrap up the trip. During this dinner, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced at each other's houses. The partner and her sister thought it's a nice surprise, but the author expressed their dislike. The author mentioned they might have things to do, need personal days, and the house might not be presentable. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair that her family can't just drop by, and the author retorting that it's their house too. The partner's parents labeled the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" because they usually don't voice opinions around her family. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the unexpected guests and the author's response. The author's partner and her family see surprise visits as a positive, but the author has different preferences. The author was honest about their feelings in a situation where they might not usually express them. The main conflict is between the partner's family's social norms and the author's personal boundaries.\n\nThe author's house is shared with their partner, so the right to privacy and to have space is valid. The partner's family visiting without notice could disrupt the author's plans or personal time. The author's response seems reasonable, emphasizing the importance of prior notice and the fact that it's not just the partner's home. The partner's family might feel insulted because the author didn't agree with their usual practice, but the author has the right to set boundaries in their own home.\n\nThe partner is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's discomfort. The author wasn't overly aggressive but expressed their viewpoint. Being called \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misinterpretation, as the author was just stating their preferences. The author's approach could be seen as assertive, which is healthy for setting boundaries. \n\nI think the author is justified in wanting to control who enters their home and when. The partner's family should respect that. The answer should be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
