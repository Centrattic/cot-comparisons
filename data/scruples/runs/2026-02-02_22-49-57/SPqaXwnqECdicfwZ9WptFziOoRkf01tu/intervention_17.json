I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author expressing dislike for unexpected guests in their home, which is shared with their partner and her family. The partner and her family seem to expect that guests can drop by without notice, but the author finds this intrusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a household, so their home is a shared space. When someone expresses a preference about their personal space, especially a valid one like needing privacy or time to themselves, it's reasonable. The author isn't saying people can't visit ever, just that unexpected visits without notice are a problem. They even gave examples of why this is an issue\u2014like needing to get things done or wanting a day to themselves. Also, the comment about the house being in a state is about respecting their own home, which is a common concern.\n\nThe partner's family is upset because they consider these surprise visits as nice gestures. However, the author's right to set boundaries in their home is important. The partner is caught in the middle, trying to balance both her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author's response was direct but not aggressive\u2014they explained their reasons calmly. The fact that they usually hold back their opinions but finally spoke up doesn't make them wrong. It's about mutual respect in a shared living situation. The family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair if they were just stating their boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they have a valid point about personal space and boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
