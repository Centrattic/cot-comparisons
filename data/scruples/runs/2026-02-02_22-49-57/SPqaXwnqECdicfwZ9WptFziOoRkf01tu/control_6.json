I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not liking unexpected guests at their home, which is shared with their partner and her family.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author, their partner, and the partner's family returned from Iceland. They had a meal at a fancy restaurant, and during the meal, the topic came up about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced as surprises. The partner and her sister like this, but the author doesn't. The author explained they might have things to do and need some alone time, plus they don't want the house to be messy if someone shows up. Now, the partner is upset, saying it's unfair that the family can't just drop by. The author says this is their house too, and they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, leading to being labeled as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key here is about boundaries in a shared living space. The author is expressing their discomfort with unannounced visits, which is a valid concern. People have different social preferences; some like spontaneity, others prefer planning. The author's partner seems to align with the family's preference, but the author is standing their ground by stating their own needs. \n\nThe author's statement about the house being as much theirs as the partner's is a strong point. If they live together, both should have input on house rules. The author isn't being aggressive by expressing their opinion; rather, they're setting boundaries. The partner's family might not have considered the other person's perspective, assuming that their way is the only way. \n\nThe author's approach seems reasonable. They didn't act out or forbid the family outright but expressed their feelings calmly. The conflict arises because the partner and her family didn't expect the author to have different preferences. The author isn't wrong for wanting to have control over their home environment. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to have boundaries in their home, which is a healthy and necessary thing in any living arrangement. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations and communicate better with the author to find a middle ground. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
