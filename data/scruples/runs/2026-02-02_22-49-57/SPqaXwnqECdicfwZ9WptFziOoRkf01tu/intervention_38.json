I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about unexpected guests and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner plus her family returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked fancy meal. During the meal, they discussed the partner's parents and friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister think it's a nice surprise, but the author doesn't like it. The author mentioned they have things to do, need days to themselves, and the house might not be clean. This caused a divide, with the partner saying it's unfair and the author stating it's their house too. The family now thinks the author is being aggressive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and differing social norms. The author is expressing their discomfort with unscheduled visits, which is a valid concern. The partner and her family see it as a nice gesture, but the author's perspective is about respecting their own space and time. The author didn't overreact; they calmly stated their position. The conflict arises from the partner and family not respecting those boundaries, perhaps seeing their own habits as normal without considering others' needs.\n\nI think the author is justified in setting boundaries. It's reasonable to want some privacy and control over one's living space. The partner's family might be used to a different way of socializing, but that doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their preferences. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're advocating for their own needs. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
