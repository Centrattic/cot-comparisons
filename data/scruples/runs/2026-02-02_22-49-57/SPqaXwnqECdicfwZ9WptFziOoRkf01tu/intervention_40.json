I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not liking unexpected guests in their home, which is causing tension with their partner and her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple and the partner's family just returned from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal. During the meal, the topic of surprise visits came up. The author expressed discomfort with unexpected guests, explaining they might have things to do and need alone time. The partner and her family see it as a nice surprise, but the author thinks the house is also theirs and shouldn't be in disarray if people show up unannounced. Now there's a divide, and the partner's family labels the author as aggressively opinionated.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants validation. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's main points: They don't like surprises, they need personal time, and they're concerned about the house state. These are valid personal boundaries. The partner and her family see it as a nice gesture, but the author is asserting their own space. The conflict arises from differing values\u2014some see spontaneity as positive, others see it as a disruption.\n\nIs expressing a preference about one's own home a wrong? The house is shared between the couple. If the partner's family is visiting without notice, that's an issue. The author is standing up for their space, which is reasonable. The partner might be in the middle, trying to balance both sides.\n\nThe partner's family feeling \"aggressively opinionated\" might be because they're used to being accommodating and now the author isn't. But the author is stating their boundaries, which is not wrong. They're not being aggressive, just expressing a different view. The problem is more on the partner's side for not mediating or understanding the author's perspective.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're asserting their rights in their own home, which is justifiable. The conflict is more about differing expectations and the partner's family not respecting those boundaries.\n"
