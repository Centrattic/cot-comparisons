I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author, their partner, and the partner's family. They had a conflict after discussing how the partner's parents and friends visit each other's homes unannounced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author made it clear they don't like surprises and want some alone time. They mentioned needing to do things or have a day to themselves, which is a valid need for personal space. The partner, however, sees her family's unannounced visits as nice surprises. \n\nThe key point here is about mutual respect. The author is asserting their own boundaries by stating that the house is shared and they don't want to be disturbed without notice. The partner's family is upset because they feel the author is being too strict. But the author isn't saying they can never have guests; they're just advocating for advance notice and respecting their own time. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to communicate their needs. The author didn't act out aggressively but calmly expressed their preferences. The partner's family might not be used to having their habits challenged, leading to the label of \"aggressively opinionated,\" but the author's stance is about setting healthy boundaries. \n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the author. They're standing up for their personal space, which is a reasonable expectation. The partner might need to mediate to find a compromise, like giving a heads-up before visiting. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
