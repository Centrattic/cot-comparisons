I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about unexpected guests. The author is with their partner and her family after a trip. They had a fancy dinner planned, and during the conversation, the author expressed that they don't like unexpected guests. The partner and her sister think it's nice, but the author feels it's intrusive because they might have things to do or need a day to themselves. The author also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up unannounced.\n\nNow, the partner's family feels that the author is being too rigid or aggressive because they usually don't voice their opinions. The main conflict is about boundaries in a shared living space. The author is asserting their right to privacy and personal space, which is a valid need. However, the partner's family sees this as a negative reaction to their usual behavior. \n\nIs the author wrong for not liking surprise visits? Well, it's about personal preferences and boundaries. Since the author is sharing a home with their partner's family, they have the right to set boundaries. The issue is whether the way they expressed it was appropriate. The author did explain their reasons calmly, so it's more about differing expectations rather than being in the wrong. The family might not have considered the author's perspective before, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for having a preference, especially since they've been holding back their opinions. They have a right to their space. The partner's family might need to adjust their habits if they live together. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
