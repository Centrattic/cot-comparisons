I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner's family who are used to dropping by unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. The author is part of a shared home, so they have a right to set boundaries. The partner's family might have different social norms, but that doesn't mean the author should tolerate discomfort. The author explained their reasons calmly, which is reasonable.\n\nThe partner is taking the family's side, saying it's not fair. But the author is asserting their own needs, which is valid. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their preferences. The family labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems like a deflection from their own behavior.\n\nAlso, the author usually holds back their opinions but this time felt it necessary. That suggests they're trying to be considerate but now need to be honest. Their concern about the house being in disarray is practical too. So, I think the author is justified in their stance. They're not in the wrong for setting healthy boundaries.\n"
