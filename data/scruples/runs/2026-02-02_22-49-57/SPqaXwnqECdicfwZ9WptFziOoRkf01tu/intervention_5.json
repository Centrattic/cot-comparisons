I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. The situation involves the author's partner and her family, who are okay with showing up unannounced. The author expressed their discomfort, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. It's common for couples to have different comfort levels with social interactions. The author mentioned that they usually hold back their opinions around the partner's family, so this might be the first time they voiced their feelings. The partner's family now sees the author as aggressive, but maybe that's because they're used to not hearing that perspective before.\n\nThe author's house is shared, so they have a right to set boundaries about guests. The partner is defending her family's behavior, which could mean there's a cultural or family norm they're following. However, the author's need for personal space and preparation time is valid. It's about mutual respect: the partner's family should respect the author's wishes, and the author should also consider the partner's feelings.\n\nThe key points are the right to set boundaries and the communication style. The author expressed their feelings without aggression, just stating their preferences. The partner's family might be resistant to change, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's about finding a middle ground where both sides' needs are met. Since the author isn't being hostile but is standing up for their own needs, they're probably not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
