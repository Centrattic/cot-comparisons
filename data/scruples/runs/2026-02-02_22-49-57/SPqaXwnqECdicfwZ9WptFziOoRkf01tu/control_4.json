I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not liking unexpected guests. They had a discussion with their partner and her family about surprising each other at home. The author expressed their discomfort, mentioning they might have things to do or need a day to themselves and that the house might not be ready. The partner's family is upset, labeling the author as aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common boundaries in relationships. It's reasonable for someone to want privacy in their own home. The author isn't against socializing entirely but has valid reasons for not liking surprises\u2014personal time, preparation, etc. The partner's family seems to have different expectations, but that doesn't negate the author's feelings.\n\nNext, the author's communication style. They did express their opinion calmly, stating their needs without being confrontational. The partner and her family might feel it's rude to say no, but the author is asserting their own space, which is a healthy boundary. The term \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a misinterpretation from the family, possibly because they're used to different social norms.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author usually holds back their opinions but this time shared their feelings shows they were careful. It's about mutual respect. The house is shared, so both sides should respect each other's preferences. The partner's family shouldn't assume they can always drop by without notice, especially if it's a shared living space.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has the right to set boundaries. The partner's family might need to adjust their expectations. The key here is that both parties need to find a middle ground, but the author isn't wrong for standing up for their needs. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
