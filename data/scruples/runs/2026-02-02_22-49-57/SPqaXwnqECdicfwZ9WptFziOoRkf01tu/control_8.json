I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is at fault here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, their partner, and the partner's family just came back from Iceland and had a pre-booked meal at a fancy restaurant. While there, they talked about the partner's parents and their friends showing up unannounced. The partner and her sister like these surprise visits, but the user doesn't. The user explained they don't like unexpected guests because they might have things to do or need some alone time, and also mentioned not wanting the house to be messy if someone shows up. This caused a rift because the partner thinks her family shouldn't be restricted, and the user's family now sees him as being aggressive. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common boundaries in relationships, especially when it comes to personal space and visiting friends/family. In many relationships, both partners should have a say in how their shared living space is managed. The user is asserting their own needs, which is a valid thing. It's not unreasonable to want some control over when guests come over, especially if it's a private home. The partner's family might be used to being able to drop by, but that doesn't mean the user has to accept that as the norm. The user's concern about the house being in a state (messy) is a practical issue too.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner and her family might feel that the user is overreacting or not being accommodating. However, the user did express their feelings calmly, explaining their reasons. They didn't say they hate the partner's family or refuse them entirely, just that they don't like unexpected visits. The fact that the user usually holds their tongue and only spoke up because they were uncomfortable adds to the argument that they were justified in expressing their feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the right to personal space, communication of expectations, and mutual respect. The user is standing up for their own needs in a respectful way, which is important in any relationship. The partner and her family might need to adjust their expectations, but the user isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. The label of \"aggressively opinionated\" seems harsh given the user's explanation was about their personal preferences and practical concerns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to have some control over their home and personal time. The answer should be B (No).\n"
