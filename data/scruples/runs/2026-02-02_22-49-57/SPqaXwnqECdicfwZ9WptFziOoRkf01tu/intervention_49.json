I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's partner and her family who like to drop by unannounced, but the author doesn't like that. The author expressed their discomfort, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author has a right to their personal space and preferences. They mentioned they might have things to do and need alone time, which is valid. The partner's family might have their own cultural or social norms around visiting, but that doesn't negate the author's feelings.\n\nThe author's response was to explain their stance without being aggressive, saying they usually hold their opinions but this time they had to speak up. The partner is upset, feeling it's unfair, but the author is asserting their home as shared. It's important to note that shared ownership implies mutual respect for each other's comfort levels.\n\nThe family labeling the author as \"aggressively opinionated\" might be a defense mechanism if they feel their usual behavior is being challenged. However, the author isn't being aggressive; they're stating their needs. The key here is whether expressing one's boundaries is considered wrong. In most cases, setting boundaries isn't the issue\u2014it's about clear communication and mutual respect.\n\nI think the author is justified in expressing their discomfort. The real issue might be the partner and her family not respecting those boundaries previously. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their needs, especially in a shared living space. So the answer should be B.\n"
