I just said I wasnt really a fan of it as I might have things that I'm doing/needing to get done and that some times I like a day to myself not having to worry about people bothering me. Finished it by saying that I wouldn't want the house to be in a state if people show up unannounced. \n\nThis has since caused a divide because my partner is basically saying that its not fair that her family cant just show up whenever to which I replied that she and her family need to realise that this is just as much my house as it hers. \nAnd because I usually bite my tongue around her family and dont share my opinion I've instantly been labelled as aggressively opinionated by her parents. \n\nSo AITA? \n\nP.s If you have any other questions please feel free to ask. I'm not sure what else to include. \n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not liking unexpected guests. Their partner's family and parents just came back from Iceland, had a nice meal planned, and during that conversation, they mentioned not being a fan of surprise visits. The partner thinks it's a nice thing, but the author doesn't. Now there's a divide because the partner's family is upset and thinks the author is being aggressive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author expressed their dislike for unexpected guests, which is their right. They explained that they might need alone time or have tasks to do. The partner's family seems to have a different norm where showing up unannounced is seen as a nice surprise. But the author is a cohabitant, so they have the right to their space and privacy. The partner is defending her family's behavior, but maybe not considering the author's perspective. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did communicate their feelings, which is important. The partner's family might not have considered that perspective before. The author isn't wrong for having their own preferences, especially in their own home. The partner's family's reaction of labeling them as \"aggressively opinionated\" seems unfair, because expressing a boundary isn't aggression. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong. They're advocating for their needs, which is necessary in a relationship. The partner and her family need to adjust their behavior to respect the author's boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
