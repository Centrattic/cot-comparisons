I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a paid dominatrix session where the author didn't pay after the domme ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, the author set up a session with clear parameters: he specified a medium level of ballbusting, and they agreed on a safe word system using a ball in his hand. When the domme went beyond his limits and he dropped the ball (the safe word), she didn't stop, causing him significant pain and injury. He then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to a dispute.\n\nThe domme argues that she pushed his limits, which is part of the role, and he broke her equipment, costing her money. His friend, another domme, says he should have paid anyway. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, the author paid a deposit, agreed on terms, and the domme failed to adhere to the agreed-upon safe word protocol. This is a breach of contract. However, the domme might claim she was following the dynamics of the role, where a sub might pretend to safeword but not mean it. But in this case, the author clearly dropped the ball, and she didn't stop, leading to injury. That's a serious safety issue.\n\nLegally, if there's a contract (even verbal) to provide a service under certain conditions, and the service provider didn't follow those conditions, the client might have grounds to withhold payment. The injury could also be a factor in legal terms, but since it's a consensual adult activity, that complicates things. Ethically, the domme's responsibility is to respect the safe word, so her failure to do so could make her at fault. The author's refusal to pay could be justified if the service wasn't delivered as agreed. However, the deposit might still need to be considered. \n\nBut the domme's argument is that the author broke her equipment, which is a separate issue. However, the breakage might have been a result of her continued force after the safe word. The author's friend, being another domme, might have a different perspective, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word, leading to injury, and thus the service wasn't delivered properly. The author has a valid reason to withhold the remaining payment.\n"
