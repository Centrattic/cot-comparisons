I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme (dominant) in a BDSM context. The key points here are the use of a safe word and the aftermath of the session.\n\nFirst, the author and the Domme agreed on a safe word system: holding a ball in hand, and dropping it would signal the Domme to stop. However, during the session, the Domme continued despite the safe word being triggered. The author ended up in severe pain, had to break restraints, and went to the hospital. The Domme then demanded payment and threatened to spread negative information if the author didn't pay.\n\nNow, the author didn't pay because the Domme ignored the safe word, which is a critical safety measure in BDSM. The Domme, on the other hand, argues that she provided the service and is owed payment, and that the broken restraints caused her loss. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong because the Domme breached the agreed-upon safety terms, leading to harm. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service was not performed as agreed. However, in the context of the BDSM community, there might be different norms. The friend, who is also a Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying, implying that payment is expected regardless of the incident. \n\nBut the main issue here is the violation of the safe word protocol. The Domme's failure to adhere to the agreed safety measures could constitute negligence, especially if it led to injury. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as a response to this breach. However, the author might have a legal obligation to pay if the payment terms were part of a contract, but since this is a private arrangement and not a formal contract, it's more about mutual agreement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the Domme failed to follow the safety protocols they both agreed on, which led to harm. The author's refusal to pay is a result of the Domme's negligence. So the answer is B: No.\n"
