I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme (a dominant partner in a BDSM context), where the writer didn't pay the agreed amount after the Domme ignored their safe word and caused significant injury.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer set up a session, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a maximum of medium-level ballbusting. The Domme used restraints and a ball gag, and the safe word was holding a ball, which if dropped meant she should stop. However, after the writer dropped the ball (indicating they wanted to stop), the Domme continued for three more powerful kicks, leading to injury. The writer then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to the Domme threatening to report them in the community.\n\nThe main question is whether the writer is at fault. The Domme ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental part of consent and safety in BDSM practices. Even if the Domme claimed she was pushing the writer's limits, the safe word is supposed to be respected regardless. The writer ended up injured, which is a serious consequence. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, especially since she continued after the safe word was triggered.\n\nThe writer's friend, who is also a Domme, said the writer was in the wrong for not paying and breaking the restraints. However, the writer's friend's opinion might be influenced by the dynamics of the Dominant/submissive relationship, possibly prioritizing the payment and equipment over the safety and well-being of the sub.\n\nLegally, the situation might be more complex. If the Domme caused harm through negligence, the writer might have a case, but that's a different angle. Ethically, the Domme failed to respect the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a breach of trust and safety. The writer's refusal to pay could be justified as they were injured due to the Domme's disregard for the safe word, which she was supposed to uphold.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once a session is agreed upon, the payment is expected regardless of the outcome, but this is a paid service. However, the service here was not delivered as contracted, especially since the Domme violated the terms of the agreement (safe word). The injury adds another layer, making it not just about the service not being completed but about potential harm caused by the provider.\n\nIn summary, the writer's refusal to pay seems justified because the Domme breached the agreed terms and caused harm. The writer's actions (not paying, going to the hospital) were in response to the Domme's negligence. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
