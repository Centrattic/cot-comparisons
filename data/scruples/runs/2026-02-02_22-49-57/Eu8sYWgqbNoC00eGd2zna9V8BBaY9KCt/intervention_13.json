I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word. The key points are: he set up a session for $350, gave a $50 deposit, agreed to medium power ballbusting, but she ended up doing much harder kicks and even after he dropped the safe word (a ball), she kept going. He then broke the restraints and didn't pay, leading to the Domme threatening to report him in the community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of safe words in BDSM. Safe words are agreed-upon signals to stop the activity immediately when the sub is in pain or wants to end the session. Ignoring a safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety. The Domme's actions here seem to disregard that agreement, which could lead to physical harm. The user dropped the ball, which was their safe word signal, but she didn't stop. That's a problem because the Domme is responsible for respecting the boundaries set by the sub.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He didn't pay the remaining $300 because he felt she violated the safe word. The Domme is upset about the payment and the broken restraints. The user's friend, another Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying, arguing that pushing limits is part of the role. But pushing beyond agreed limits is a big no-no in BDSM. It's about consent and respecting limits. If the Domme went beyond what was agreed, then the sub isn't obligated to pay for the service that was outside the original contract.\n\nAlso, the user went to the hospital after the incident, which shows the severity of the situation. The Domme's reaction of yelling and threatening to damage his reputation seems more about her not getting paid rather than the sub's well-being. In a proper BDSM relationship, the Domme's primary responsibility is the sub's safety. If she compromised that, the sub has a right to refuse payment and report her for misconduct.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme failed to respect the agreed boundaries, leading to physical harm, and the author acted in his own interest to seek medical help and not pay for a session that was dangerous and non-consensual beyond the agreed terms.\n"
