I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme (dominant) where the submissive (the author) felt the domme ignored his safe word and caused harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreed-upon terms. The author set a safe word system using a ball. When he dropped the ball (the safe word), the domme didn't stop, which is a violation of their agreement. The safe word is supposed to be a clear stop signal, and ignoring it is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nThe domme was supposed to stop immediately upon the safe word being triggered. The fact that she continued for three more powerful kicks after he dropped the ball is a major issue. The author's limits were clearly stated as medium power max, but she exceeded that. This could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on the laws in their area.\n\nThe domme then started yelling at the author for breaking a restraint, which seems like an excuse to shift blame. The author wasn't paying because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols and caused harm. The friend, who's also a domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying, but that might be from a different perspective where the agreement is strictly financial, not considering the safety violation.\n\nLegally and ethically, the domme has a responsibility to stop when the safe word is used. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not rendered as agreed, and there was potential harm. The domme's threats to blacken the author's name in the community might be an attempt to coerce payment despite the violation.\n\nSo, the author wasn't wrong for not paying because the domme broke the agreement and endangered his safety. The answer should be B (No).\n"
