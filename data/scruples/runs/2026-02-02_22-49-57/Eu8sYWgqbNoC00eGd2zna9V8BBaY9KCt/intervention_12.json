I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session between a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) and a submissive. The key points here are the use of a safe word and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the writer set up a session with a Domme, paid a deposit, and discussed their limits. The safe word was dropping a ball in their hand. When the Domme ignored the safe word and continued after the writer dropped the ball, leading to injury, the writer refused to pay the remaining amount and left. The Domme then threatened to report the writer to the community for not paying.\n\nThe main issue here is the violation of the safe word. In BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. If a Domme ignores the safe word, they're not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a serious breach. The writer's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, leading to harm. However, some might argue that the contract was made, and the writer still received the service (even if it was harmful), so payment is expected. But since the service involved a breach of safety protocols, it's a gray area. The friend (another Domme) says the writer is in the wrong, thinking the Domme was just pushing limits, but if the safe word was ignored, that's a red flag. The writer's health was compromised, so refusing payment for a session where safety was violated might be reasonable. The Domme's threats to report the writer could be a tactic to collect payment, but it doesn't excuse her actions. So the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
