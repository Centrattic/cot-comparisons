I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who provided a service, but the client didn't pay after the session because the domme ignored his safe word, leading to injury and a hospital visit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the agreement. The client paid a $50 deposit and agreed to pay $350 total. The domme didn't ask for the money upfront, which is a bit out of the ordinary, but the client was expected to pay the remaining $300 at the end. The client's main argument is that the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocol by continuing the session after he dropped the safe word (the ball). This led to severe pain and injury, necessitating a hospital visit. \n\nBDSM practices require clear communication and adherence to safety words. The safe word system is a fundamental part of consent and safety in such activities. If the domme ignored the safe word, which was a clear signal to stop, she breached the agreed-upon boundaries. Even in a consensual power exchange, the safety of the sub (client) is paramount. The domme's actions here went beyond the client's stated limits, leading to harm, which invalidates the consensual nature of the activity. \n\nThe client's friend, who is also a domme, argues that the client should pay because the domme pushed his limits, which is part of the role. However, pushing limits doesn't mean ignoring explicit signals to stop. The client's physical reaction (dropping the ball, almost passing out) was a direct request to stop, and the domme's continued actions made the situation unsafe. \n\nBreaking the restraint could be seen as an accident due to the client's distress, and the client's refusal to pay is justified because the service delivered was harmful and didn't meet the agreed terms. The domme's demand for payment after causing injury and ignoring the safe word is questionable. \n\nAdditionally, the client's decision to seek medical attention shows he took appropriate action for his safety. The domme's threat to report the client for non-payment and not paying attention to the client's well-being is also concerning. \n\nIn terms of contractual obligations, if the service was not fulfilled as agreed (i.e., the client was harmed instead of receiving a consensual session within his limits), the client isn't obligated to pay the remaining amount. The client's priority was his health and safety, which are valid reasons to refuse payment in this context. \n\nSo, the domme's actions were negligent, and the client's refusal to pay is justified. The client is not in the wrong because the domme failed to uphold the safety agreement, leading to harm. The answer should be B (No)."
