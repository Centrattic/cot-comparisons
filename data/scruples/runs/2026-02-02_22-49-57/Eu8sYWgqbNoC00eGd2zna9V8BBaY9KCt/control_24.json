I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. They discussed limits, specifying medium max power. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the Domme agreed to. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, causing severe pain. The author dropped the ball (safe word), but the Domme continued, leading to the author breaking a restraint and heading to the hospital.\n\nNow, the key points here. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange or fetish activity. Its purpose is to ensure the sub's safety and to signal when they need to stop. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a breach of the agreed-upon safety measures. The author's right to stop the activity when in pain is paramount. \n\nThe Domme then claims that pushing limits is part of the job, but if the author had communicated the need to stop and the Domme didn't, that's a problem. The fact that the author had to break restraints to stop the session suggests the Domme wasn't responsive. Also, the author wasn't responsible for the equipment breaking; the Domme's actions led to that. \n\nThe friend, another Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying. But if the Domme violated the safe word, the author isn't obligated to pay. The service wasn't performed as agreed because the safety protocol was ignored. The author's priority here is their health, so not paying the remaining $300 makes sense. \n\nThe Domme then threatened to report the author for non-payment, which is retaliatory and unethical. The author's decision to seek medical help was necessary, and withholding payment in this case is justified. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to follow the established safety rules, endangering the author's health. The author has the right to refuse payment when the terms of the service (including safety) were not met.\n"
