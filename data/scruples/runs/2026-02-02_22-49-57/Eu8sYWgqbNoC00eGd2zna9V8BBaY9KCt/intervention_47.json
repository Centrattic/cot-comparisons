I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme not respecting a safe word during a session, leading to injury and the client not paying. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person paid a deposit, set up a session with clear limits, including a safe word (dropping a ball). The Domme exceeded the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and then expected payment despite the client's injury. The client refused to pay, leading to accusations of being in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the client is obligated to pay despite the Domme's failure to follow agreed-upon safety protocols. In consensual activities, especially those involving power dynamics, agreed terms and safety measures are crucial. The Domme's actions went beyond what was consented to, which could be considered a violation of the terms. The client's refusal to pay could be justified because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon limits and caused harm. The broken restraint might be the client's fault if they struggled, but the primary issue is the Domme's disregard for the safe word. \n\nHowever, the friend, who's also a domme, argues the client should pay, suggesting that pushing limits is part of the role. But that overlooks the fact that the client clearly stated their limits and the safe word was ignored. The client's health and safety should take precedence over payment. The Domme's responsibility is to ensure the session stays within the agreed boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, the client isn't in the wrong for not paying because the service provided was outside the agreed terms and caused harm. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word is a major breach, and the client is justified in seeking medical attention and withholding payment due to the violation of their boundaries.\n"
