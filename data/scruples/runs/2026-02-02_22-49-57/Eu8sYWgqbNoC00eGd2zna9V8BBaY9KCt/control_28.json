I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person arranged a session with a domme for $350. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. However, during the session, the domme went beyond the agreed-upon intensity, leading to the person dropping the ball but her continuing. He ended up in severe pain, broke a restraint, and didn't pay the remaining $300. The domme is now threatening to report him for non-payment, and his friend, who's also a domme, says he should have paid despite the issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safe word being ignored, the physical harm caused, and the refusal to pay. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, consensual activities, especially in kink or BDSM, require clear communication and adherence to agreed-upon limits. The safe word is a critical part of that, and if the domme ignored it, she breached the agreed terms. The person's decision not to pay could be seen as a response to her violating the safety agreement, which is a legitimate reason. However, some might argue that the service was provided, and payment is expected regardless of the outcome. \n\nBut the domme's actions led to physical harm, which is a serious issue. The person had a valid reason to stop the session, and the domme's failure to respect the safe word could be considered negligence or even assault. In that case, not paying makes sense because the service wasn't performed as agreed and caused harm. \n\nAlso, the friend's opinion that he should pay might be biased, as she's part of the domme community and might prioritize community norms over the individual's experience. However, in consensual power exchange, the sub has the right to enforce boundaries. \n\nLegally, if a service is performed without following the agreed terms, the recipient isn't obligated to pay. Plus, the person sought medical attention, which indicates that the situation was serious. The domme's retaliation for not paying and threatening to damage his reputation in the community adds another layer, suggesting possible coercion. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word protocol, caused harm, and the refusal to pay is a direct result of that breach. The answer should be B.\n"
