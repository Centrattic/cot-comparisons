I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key elements. The author and the Domme agreed on a session with specific terms, including a safe word. The safe word was a ball in the hand, and if dropped, the Domme should stop immediately. However, during the session, the Domme continued even after the safe word was triggered, causing significant pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300, citing the breach of safety protocols.\n\nThe Domme's side, according to the friend, is that the author should have paid because the Domme pushed their limits as part of the role. But the author argues that the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, leading to harm. \n\nLegal and ethical considerations come into play here. Contracts (even informal ones) require both parties to adhere to agreed terms. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange, especially in activities involving physical domination. By ignoring the safe word, the Domme may have breached the agreed-upon safety measures, which could be considered a violation of the terms of the service. \n\nAdditionally, the author suffered physical injury, which might absolve them from paying if there was a breach of the contract's essential terms. However, the Domme might counter that the injury was a result of the activity itself, which carries inherent risks. But if the safe word was explicitly agreed upon and ignored, that's a different matter. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying is subjective, but the core issue is whether the Domme's actions justified the author's refusal to pay. Since the Domme didn't follow the safety agreement, the author might have a valid reason to not pay, as the service was not performed as contracted. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal responsibility. The author set their own limits and could have potentially escalated the situation. But the key is the Domme's failure to adhere to the agreed-upon safe word. In consensual activities, respecting the safe word is paramount. \n\nIn conclusion, the Domme's actions likely breached the agreement, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not paying. The safe word was ignored, leading to harm, which is a fundamental violation. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
