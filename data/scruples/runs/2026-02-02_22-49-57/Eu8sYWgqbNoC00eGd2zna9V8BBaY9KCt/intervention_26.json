I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who paid a domme for a session involving ballbusting. They set up a safe word system using a ball in their hand, and if they dropped it, the domme should stop immediately. But during the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, causing severe pain, and even after the safe word was triggered (the ball was dropped), she didn't stop and kept hitting. The author ended up breaking the restraints and covering themselves, then left without paying, and the domme is upset about not being paid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a prior agreement with the domme about their limits and a safe word. The domme didn't follow through when the safe word was triggered, leading to injury and the author going to the hospital. The domme is now threatening to report them for not paying and damaging her equipment, but the author is withholding payment because the domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety in BDSM: The safe word system is crucial. If a safe word is used, the person in control (the domme) should stop immediately. The author's safe word was dropping the ball, which they did, but the domme didn't stop. That's a major breach of trust and safety. \n\nThe domme's actions caused the author to be hurt, leading to a hospital visit. Even if the author had initially agreed to \"medium power max,\" the domme exceeded that, so she might have crossed the line into non-consensual harm. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as justified if the service provided was not in line with the agreed-upon terms. The domme's response of threatening to tell the community and not accepting payment after the fact might be her way of holding the author accountable, but if she didn't honor the safe word, that's a problem.\n\nThe friend, who's a domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying. But maybe she's not considering the violation of the safe word. The author's friend might think pushing limits is part of the experience, but that's different from ignoring a safe word. The author's health and safety are paramount, so not paying because the domme didn't follow the agreed rules makes sense.\n\nAlso, the author didn't pay upfront, just a deposit. The rest was supposed to be paid after the session. But since the session wasn't completed properly and caused harm, the author might have a right to withhold payment. The domme's equipment being damaged was a result of the author's injury from her not stopping, so the domme's loss is due to her own negligence.\n\nIn terms of\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d23\u4efb: In some places, disputes over services might be handled through small claims court, but if the domme didn't provide the service as agreed (i.e., not respecting the safe word leading to injury), the author might have a valid reason to not pay. However, it's a bit of a legal gray area depending on local laws and how the agreement was made.\n\nMoral and ethical standpoint: The domme's failure to stop when the safe word was triggered is a serious issue. The author's priority was their safety and health, which is understandable. The domme's threat to harm the author's reputation in the community if they don't pay seems unethical, especially after causing injury.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to injury and thus the author not paying. The domme's responsibility is to ensure the session stays within the agreed limits, and she failed at that. The author's right to withhold payment in this case is justified.\n"
