I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session where the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word, leading to the author not paying and facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of a safe word in consensual power dynamics. Safe words are crucial for setting boundaries and ensuring that activities stop if someone is in too much pain or discomfort. The author set up a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal the domme to stop. However, the domme continued after the safe word was triggered, which is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The author paid a deposit, but the domme didn't ask for the full payment upfront. The author decided not to pay the remaining $300 because the domme violated the safety agreement. The domme is now threatening to report the author for non-payment. \n\nThe author's friend, another domme, thinks the author is wrong for not paying. She argues that the domme was within her right to push limits and that the author should pay despite the incident. But the key issue here is the violation of the safe word. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a major violation of the agreed terms. The author has a valid reason to not proceed with payment because the service was not delivered as contracted. The author's health and safety were compromised, which is a significant factor.\n\nAlso, the domme's response\u2014yelling, threatening to inform the community, and not offering a resolution\u2014suggests that she's more concerned with her financial loss than the client's well-being. The author's decision to seek medical attention and not pay is justified because the domme didn't adhere to the agreed safety protocols, making the session non-consensual and dangerous.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme breached the safety agreement, and the author is within their rights to withhold payment under those circumstances. The domme's actions were unethical and unsafe, so the author's refusal to pay is justified.\n"
