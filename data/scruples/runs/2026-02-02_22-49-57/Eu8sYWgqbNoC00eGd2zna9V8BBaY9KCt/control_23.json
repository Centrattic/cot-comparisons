I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. He set clear limits\u2014medium power max for ballbusting. The safe word was dropping a ball, which he did, but she kept going. The Domme didn't stop, causing him severe pain and injury. Then he didn't pay the remaining $300 and left, got medical help.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nHe agreed to the terms, paid a deposit, and the session happened. The Domme didn't follow his safe word, which was a crucial part of their agreement. The safe word is supposed to be a hard stop. She ignored it, causing him harm. He didn't complete payment because she breached the agreement. \n\nThe friend says he's an asshole for not paying, but maybe the friend is missing that the Domme failed her duty. The service wasn't delivered properly; she didn't respect his boundaries, leading to injury. In that case, the author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was performed negligently. Also, the broken restraints might be her responsibility if they broke due to her actions. \n\nSo, the key points: the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, caused harm, and he didn't pay because of that breach. Legally, if you don't deliver the service as contracted, the other party isn't obligated to pay. Ethically, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his safety over payment when the terms weren't followed. The friend's argument that he should pay despite the breach seems one-sided. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
