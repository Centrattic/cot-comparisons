I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (dominant) and a sub (the author). They agreed on a session with a safe word. The author agreed to a medium level of ballbusting. The Domme ended up going harder than agreed, he used the safe word (dropped the ball), but she didn't stop. He then broke free, went to the hospital, and refused to pay her. The friend, another Domme, says he should have paid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the consent and safety protocols. The safe word is a crucial part of any consensual power exchange, especially in activities like this. If the Domme ignored the safe word (the dropped ball) after the author signaled to stop, that's a violation of their agreed-upon terms. The author's action of dropping the ball was the agreed safe word, so the Domme should have stopped immediately. Not doing so is a breach of trust and could be considered assault, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The author paid a deposit and was supposed to pay the remaining $300. But since the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms and caused harm, the author might argue that the service wasn't delivered as promised. However, in some contexts, once the session starts, the payment is expected regardless of the outcome. But if the Domme was negligent or violated the terms, the author might not be obligated to pay.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author is in the wrong because she \"pushed his limits,\" but that's not how consent works. The Domme should have respected the pre-established limits. Pushing beyond them is not part of the agreement and could be illegal. Also, the Domme's reaction of threatening to expose the author for not paying after the incident is problematic. The author's priority was his health, so not paying her is justified.\n\nLegal aspects: If there was a breach of the safe word protocol leading to injury, the author could have a case against the Domme. However, in some places, BDSM activities are considered consensual unless there's actual harm. But if the safe word was ignored, leading to injury, that could be a legal issue.\n\nEthically, the Domme violated the agreed-upon terms, putting the author in harm's way. The author had the right to stop the session and seek medical help. Refusing to pay in this case is understandable because the service was not delivered as agreed. The broken restraint was likely due to the excessive force, so the Domme is at fault for not adhering to the agreed limits.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The Domme's actions were the issue, and the author prioritized his safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
