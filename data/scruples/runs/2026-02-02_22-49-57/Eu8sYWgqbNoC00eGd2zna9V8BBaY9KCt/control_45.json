I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who was paid a deposit but then ignored the safe word during a session, leading to injury. The author didn't pay the remaining fee and is now being criticized by a friend who's also a domme.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The safe word was supposed to be a ball in hand; dropping it meant stopping immediately. The Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing harm. The author didn't pay the rest of the fee and is facing backlash.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, BDSM activities can be legally murky. If the Domme caused harm through negligence, the author might have a case, but it's complicated. However, the contract here is verbal and based on prior arrangements. The deposit was paid, and the session was agreed upon. The friend argues that pushing limits is part of the role, but that doesn't excuse ignoring the safe word.\n\nEthically, the safe word is fundamental in consensual power exchange. Ignoring it breaches trust and safety. The Domme's actions led to harm, so the author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't delivered safely as agreed. The broken restraints might be considered the Domme's responsibility if she used excessive force beyond agreed limits.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of payment for services rendered. Even if the service was flawed, the author might still owe the money. But since the safe word was ignored, the author might argue that the service was not performed as contracted. The friend's criticism might stem from a different understanding of consent and responsibility within the community.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures. The author's priority was their health, and the payment issue could be a matter of contractual dispute. The answer is B (No).\n"
