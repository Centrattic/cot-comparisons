I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who the author paid a deposit for a session. The author has a safe word arrangement, but the Domme ignored it during the session, leading to injury and the author not paying the remaining amount. The friend of the author, who is also a Domme, says the author is in the wrong for not paying and breaking equipment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The safe word is a crucial part of any consensual BDSM activity. The author set clear limits\u2014medium power max. The Domme went beyond that, leading to the author dropping the safe word (a ball) which she ignored, continuing to hit him. This resulted in injury. The author then didn't pay the remaining $300, which is significant. The Domme is now threatening to report him to the community for non-payment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is obligated to pay despite the Domme violating the agreed-upon safe word and causing harm. In consensual activities, especially in BDSM, the safe word is supposed to be respected. If the Domme didn't honor the safe word and caused harm beyond agreed limits, the responsibility lies with her. The author didn't consent to the level of force used, so the transaction might be void because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The deposit could be a separate issue, but the remaining payment is for the service, which wasn't properly provided. Also, the author's health and safety should take precedence. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might be from a different perspective, but the core of the problem is the breach of agreed terms by the Domme. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they were not given the service they paid for and were harmed in the process. The answer should be B.\n"
