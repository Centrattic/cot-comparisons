I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they paid a deposit for a domination session, set clear limits with the Domme, and had a safeword agreement where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. But during the session, the Domme kicked them way beyond their stated medium limit, even after they dropped the ball. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and the Domme is upset because they broke her restraints and didn't pay.\n\nFirst, the key points are about consent and the safeword. The author specified their limits upfront, and the Domme agreed. The safeword is supposed to be respected, so when the author dropped the ball as instructed, the Domme should have stopped immediately. But she didn't, which led to the author being injured. The author then left without paying because they felt the Domme violated their agreement. The friend, who's also a Domme, says the author should have paid regardless, but that seems wrong because the Domme didn't follow the agreement. The restraints breaking might be a result of the injury, which the Domme caused by not respecting the safeword. So the author's refusal to pay could be justified as a consequence of the Domme's actions. The Domme even threatened to report them for not paying, which might be a power play. Legally, maybe the author isn't obligated to pay if the service was not provided as agreed. Ethically, the Domme broke the trust and the agreed-upon safety measures, which is a serious issue. The author's health and safety are more important than the financial aspect here. So, the answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
