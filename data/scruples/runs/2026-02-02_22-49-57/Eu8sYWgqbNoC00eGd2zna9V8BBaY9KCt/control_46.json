I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is in their early 20s and into ballbusting, which they clarify is part of a light to medium max kink. They hired a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) for $350, with a $50 deposit. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which the author found unusual. They set up a safe word system where holding a ball means continue, but if they drop it, she should stop immediately, ungag, and check their status. During the session, the Domme started with kicks that were hard, leading to significant pain. At 20 minutes, she stepped back and kicked them even harder than the agreed \"medium power max.\" The author dropped the ball (the safe word signal), but the Domme didn't stop, instead gave three more powerful kicks. They almost passed out, couldn't breathe, broke a restraint, and had to cover themselves. The Domme then yelled at the author for breaking her equipment and demanded payment. The author refused, went to the hospital, and found out their testicles doubled in size but nothing was damaged. Then a friend (another Domme) says the author is an asshole for not paying and that the Domme was just pushing their limits as a good Domme would.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying after the Domme ignored their safe word and caused them harm. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consensual BDSM. Safe words are crucial in such activities to ensure that the submissive can stop the session at any time. The author established a safe word system with the Domme, and when they used it (dropping the ball), the Domme was supposed to stop immediately. However, she did not. Instead, she continued with more intense actions, leading to the author experiencing severe pain and physical injury. This is a clear violation of the agreed-upon boundaries, which are essential for safe, consensual play.\n\nThe Domme's actions here go beyond what was agreed. The author specified medium power max, and the Domme escalated to full-force kicks, which the author found dangerous and painful. The failure to stop upon the safe word being triggered is a serious breach of trust and the terms of their agreement. In BDSM, the dominant is expected to respect the submissive's limits and safe word signals. If the Domme didn't adhere to that, the author has a legitimate reason to not proceed with the full payment, especially since the session was conducted in a harmful manner.\n\nThe friend's argument that the author is an asshole for not paying because the Domme was just pushing their limits is problematic. Pushing limits is part of the dynamic, but only within the agreed-upon boundaries. If the Domme exceeded those without stopping when the safe word was used, she's not a good Domme. Also, the author's friend, as a Domme, should understand the importance of respecting safe words. The fact that the author's friend is defending the actions of the Domme in this case might not be entirely justified, especially since the author's health and safety were compromised.\n\nAnother angle is the legality and ethics of the situation. Even though BDSM is consensual, there are legal boundaries. If the Domme caused harm by ignoring the safe word, the author might have a right to withhold payment as a form of self-protection, especially if they sustaining injuries. However, the author's refusal to pay could lead to the Domme taking action in the community, which is a separate issue about how the Dominant is handling the situation.\n\nAlso, the author's immediate response to go to the hospital shows they prioritized their health, which is understandable. The Domme's reaction of yelling and demanding payment, while the author was in distress, reflects poorly on her as a Domme. A responsible Domme would have taken the safe word seriously and been concerned about the sub's well-being, not angry about the broken equipment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set clear limits and communicated the safe word system. The Domme's failure to adhere to that agreement is her fault. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a justified response to the Domme's violation of their safety, even if they typically pay for such services. The friend's judgment that the author is in the wrong seems misplaced because the key issue here is the Domme's actions, not the author's.\n\nHowever, sometimes in these situations, people argue that you should still pay for the service because it was agreed upon, regardless of the circumstances. But given that the Domme's actions were outside the agreed terms and caused harm, this argument is weaker. The service wasn't provided as negotiated, and the safety of the participant was compromised. \n\nIn summary, the Domme is at fault for not respecting the safe word and exceeding agreed-upon limits, which endangered the author's well-being. The author has a valid reason to not pay her and seek medical attention. The friend's opinion that the author is in the wrong is not taking into account the violation of the safe word and the resulting harm. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
