I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a paid dominatrix session where the author didn't pay the remaining $300 after the session. The key points are that the author had a safe word agreement (holding a ball in hand, dropping it to stop), but the Domme continued the activity even after he dropped the ball, which he said was the signal to stop. He ended up in the hospital, but no damage was found. His friend, another Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying and breaking the restraints.\n\nFirst, the safe word agreement: that's a standard practice in BDSM to ensure consent and safety. The author clearly communicated his limits (medium max) and the safe word. The Domme ignored it, which is a major red flag. Continuing after the safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety. \n\nThen, the payment issue. He paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. The Domme didn't ask for the money upfront, which is unusual. But the author didn't pay the remaining $300 because the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word. His friend, a Domme, says he should have paid regardless. But in that case, the Domme violated the terms they agreed on. The contract here is based on mutual consent and safety. If the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed limits and safe word, the service wasn't delivered properly. So, the author might not be obligated to pay the full amount. \n\nAlso, breaking the restraints was likely due to the pain, so it's understandable. The Domme's reaction to that seems inappropriate. She should have checked his status when he dropped the ball, not continued and then blamed him for breaking equipment. \n\nIn terms of legal grounds, depending on the jurisdiction, the author might be in the right not to pay if the Domme didn't follow the agreed rules, leading to harm. Ethically, the Domme's actions were wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong for withholding payment. The friend's argument that he should pay because the Domme pushed limits is flawed because pushing beyond agreed limits is a serious issue. The author's primary responsibility is his safety, and the Domme failed in that. So, answer B.\n"
