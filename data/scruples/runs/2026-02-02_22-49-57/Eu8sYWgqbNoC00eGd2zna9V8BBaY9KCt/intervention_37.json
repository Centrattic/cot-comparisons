I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant) in a consensual power exchange scenario where the person (submissive) didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The sub paid a deposit and agreed on a session with specific limits. They had a safe word setup using a ball\u2014drop it, and the Domme should stop. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, continued after the safe word was triggered, causing injury. The sub ended up in the hospital and refused to pay the remaining amount. The Domme is threatening to report the sub for non-payment, while a friend (also a Domme) is telling the sub they're wrong for not paying.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent, safety, and financial responsibility. The sub's argument is that the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to harm. The Domme's side is that she provided the service as per the agreement and is owed payment.\n\nIn consensual kink play, safety and communication are paramount. The safe word is a critical part of any negotiated scene. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a breach of the agreed terms. The sub's well-being should take priority over payment. The friend's perspective that the sub should pay regardless might come from a different viewpoint, possibly valuing the financial aspect over the violation of safety protocols.\n\nThe injury sustained is a red flag. Even if the play had limits, exceeding them to the point of causing physical harm (like doubling in size of the testicles) is a serious issue. Medical attention was needed, which the sub sought. The fact that the Domme kept going after the safe word was triggered shows a disregard for the sub's safety, which undermines the entire consent process.\n\nLegally, if there's a contract or agreed-upon terms where the Domme failed to uphold her part (safety), the sub might have grounds to withhold payment. However, legally, payment agreements can be tricky without a formal contract. Ethically, though, since the Domme breached the safety agreement, the sub's refusal to pay could be justified as self-protection.\n\nThe friend's judgment that the sub is an \"asshole\" might stem from traditional views where services paid in full regardless of outcome, but in kink communities, respecting boundaries and safety is usually a top priority. The sub's actions\u2014seeking medical help and refusing to pay due to the violation\u2014are in line with protecting their health.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to injury. The author's priority was their health, which is more important than the financial aspect in this case.\n"
