I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone who hired a domme for a session involving ballbusting, which is a type of BDSM activity. The user set up a session with a safeword system using a ball. They agreed on medium power, but the domme went beyond that, causing a lot of pain. The user dropped the ball (the safeword signal), but the domme kept going. Then the user ended up in the hospital and refused to pay, leading to the domme threatening to report him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they made. The user clearly stated their limits, including a safe word. The domme, however, ignored the safe word and went beyond the agreed-upon intensity. In BDSM, consent and following safe words are crucial. Ignoring a safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety. The user's primary responsibility is their own safety, so if the domme violated the agreed terms, the user isn't at fault for stopping the session and not paying.\n\nAlso, the domme asked for payment after the session, but the user refused because the domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms. The user ended up with injuries and had to go to the hospital. The domme's actions led to harm, so the user isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not provided as agreed and caused harm. The friend's opinion that the user should pay might be biased, as she's a domme herself, so her perspective might favor the domme community's norms.\n\nLegally, if the domme didn't follow the terms agreed upon, the user might not be liable for the full payment. Additionally, the user is within their rights to prioritize their health and safety. The domme's threat to report the user seems like an attempt to pressure payment despite the breach of contract and safety.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The domme violated the agreed-upon limits and safety protocols, leading to harm. The user's refusal to pay is justified in this context.\n"
