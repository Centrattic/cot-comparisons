I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid domme session where the sub (the author) felt that the domme ignored his safe word, leading to severe pain and subsequent refusal to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author set up a session with clear limits and a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which he did after she exceeded his agreed-upon limits. The domme continued for three more kicks despite the safeword being triggered. This led to injury concerns, and the author went to the hospital. The domme then demanded payment and threatened the community if he didn't pay, while the author's friend, a domme, is telling him he should have paid regardless.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is the violation of the agreed-upon safe word. In kink and BDSM communities, safe words are critical for consent and safety. If a domme ignores the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service provided was dangerous and not in line with their prior agreement. Additionally, the author was harmed, and the domme didn't stop when she should have, which is a major violation.\n\nThe domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, especially if she was aware of the safe word system and ignored it. The argument that the author should pay because the domme \"pushed limits\" is weak because pushing limits doesn't override the safe word. The author's friend's stance might be more about financial responsibility but misses the point of consent and safety.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of a contractual agreement. The author agreed to pay for the session, but if the domme didn't follow the agreed terms, the author might feel the contract was breached. In such cases, the client might not be obligated to pay for a service that wasn't delivered as per the terms.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because the domme failed to adhere to the safety agreements, leading to harm. The refusal to pay is a result of the domme's breach of the safe word protocol, which is a fundamental part of their agreed-upon terms.\n"
