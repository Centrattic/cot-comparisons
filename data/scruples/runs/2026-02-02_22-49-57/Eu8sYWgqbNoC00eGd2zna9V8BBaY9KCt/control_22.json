I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme (dominant in a BDSM context), where the author didn't pay because the domme ignored his safe word, leading to injury. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author agreed to a session, paid a $50 deposit, and set up a safe word system with a specific signal (dropping a ball). During the session, the domme allegedly exceeded his stated limits, ignored the safe word, caused injury, and then expected full payment. The author didn't pay and instead went to the hospital. The friend (also a domme) argues the author should have paid and is now calling him names.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. In many places, BDSM activities can be considered consensual if all parties are of age and have given informed consent. However, if there's a breach of agreed-upon limits, especially leading to harm, that could be a different story. The safe word system is a standard practice in BDSM to ensure safety. If the domme ignored the safe word, she may have violated the terms they agreed to. \n\nThe author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified if the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon protocol, leading to injury. However, the initial contract was for a session, and the terms weren't properly followed by the domme. The author isn't responsible for the domme's failure to adhere to the safe word, so not paying in this case might be reasonable. The friend's argument that the author should pay because the domme pushed limits is questionable because pushing beyond agreed limits is a breach of consent and the safe word system. \n\nAlso, the domme's reaction\u2014yelling, threatening to expose the author, and demanding payment despite the injury\u2014suggests she didn't prioritize the author's safety, which is a key part of a domme's role. The author's safety and health are paramount, so the decision not to pay in the context of receiving harm and non-compliance with the safe word might be ethically sound.\n\nIn terms of the deposit: the author paid $50 upfront. If the session was canceled or not completed as agreed, the handling of the deposit might depend on their agreement. But since the session went ahead but was problematic, the author's non-payment of the remaining $300 could be justified given the breach of terms by the domme.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The domme might claim she provided the service, so payment is due. However, if the service was not as agreed (exceeding limits, ignoring safe words), then it's not the full service as contracted. Also, the author's injury could be a factor in non-payment. Legally, this could vary by jurisdiction, but ethically, the domme's actions were in violation of the agreed-upon boundaries, making the author's non-payment understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme failed to follow the safe word protocol, caused harm, and then expected payment despite the breach. The author's priority was his health, which is the most important aspect.\n"
