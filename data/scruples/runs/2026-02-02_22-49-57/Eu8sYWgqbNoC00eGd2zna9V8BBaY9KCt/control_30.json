I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. They set up a paid session with a domme for ballbusting, which is a dominant/submissive fetish involving impact play. The author specified their limits as light to medium max. The domme didn't ask for the money upfront, but they paid a $50 deposit. They had a safe word system where holding a ball meant they were okay, and dropping it meant stop. \n\nSo during the session, the domme started with kicks, then kneeing, and finally a boot to the balls. The author said they were in a lot of pain and dropped the ball, which is their safe word. But the domme didn't stop, kept kicking for three more times. Then the author almost passed out, broke a restraint, and was yelled at by the domme for damaging her equipment. The domme then demanded the remaining $300, and when the author refused because she ignored the safe word, she threatened to tell the domme community they wouldn't pay.\n\nFirst, the key points are the agreed-upon limits and the safe word. The author communicated their max pain level was medium, but the domme went beyond that. The safe word was a specific signal (dropping a ball), and the domme didn't respond to it, which is a serious issue in any BDSM context. \n\nIn BDSM practices, consent and communication are paramount. The safe word system is a standard part of negotiations to ensure the sub can stop the activity if needed. If the domme didn't respect the safe word, that's a violation of the agreed terms. The author's priority is their safety and well-being. Since the domme disregarded the safe word and caused significant harm, the author isn't obligated to pay for a session that was conducted in a harmful and non-consensual manner after the safe word was triggered. \n\nHowever, the author did agree to the session and paid a deposit. The domme provided the initial time and then escalated beyond the agreed limits. The fact that the author said they were in a lot of pain and the domme continued despite the safe word suggests that the domme was negligent. The broken restraints might be a result of the author's reaction to the pain, which the domme's actions caused. The domme's response to damage the equipment and demand payment could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nThe friend who's a domme said the author is a huge asshole because they didn't pay and broke the equipment. But if the domme didn't follow the safe word, the author isn't responsible for the consequences of her failure to stop. Additionally, the author's injury (even if temporary) could be a result of the domme's actions, so the author's decision to not pay and seek medical help is justified. The domme's threat to the community might be a common tactic, but it doesn't negate her responsibility to adhere to the safe word. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, if the domme didn't respect the safe word and caused harm, the author has the right to refuse payment. The deposit might be a red herring because the main issue is the violation of the agreed-upon safety measures. The author isn't at fault for breaking the restraints in response to the domme's actions. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because the domme failed to honor the safe word and exceeded the agreed limits, leading to potential harm. The author's decision to prioritize their health and withhold payment is reasonable in this context.\n"
