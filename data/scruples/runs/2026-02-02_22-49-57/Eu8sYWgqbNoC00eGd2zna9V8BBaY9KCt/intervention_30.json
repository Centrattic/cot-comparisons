I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in their early 20s and into a specific kink involving ballbusting. They set up a session with a domme for $350, paid a $50 deposit. They discussed their limits: light to medium max. The domme agreed to restrain and ball gag them. The safeword was holding a ball in their hand, and if they dropped it, the domme would stop. Initially, it's okay, but after 10-20 minutes, the domme starts using harder kicks, leading to the author dropping the ball. However, the domme doesn't stop and continues, causing severe pain. The author breaks a restraint to cover themselves, and the domme stops, yelling about equipment damage. The author refuses to pay the remaining $300 and says they're going to the hospital. The domme threatens to spread the word if they don't pay. The author goes to the hospital, finds nothing damaged, and is recovering. Their friend, another domme, says they're an asshole for not paying because they broke equipment and the domme was pushing their limits.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to determine this based on the situation.\n\nFirst, consider the safeword agreement. The author clearly communicated their limits and had a safeword set up. Dropping the ball was the agreed-upon safeword, and the domme failed to honor it. That's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's health and well-being should be the priority, especially since they were in a vulnerable position (restrained and gaged). The domme's actions led to the author needing to go to the hospital, which indicates potential harm. \n\nNext, the author not paying the remaining $300. The domme didn't provide the service as agreed because she ignored the safeword. The author was injured and had to leave abruptly. In a service agreement, if the service isn't delivered properly, the client isn't obligated to pay the full amount. The deposit of $50 might be considered a non-refundable payment, but the remaining $300 was for a session that was compromised due to the domme's negligence.\n\nThe friend's argument is that the domme was pushing limits, which is common in BDSM, but the key here is that the safeword was not respected. Pushing limits is one thing, but ignoring a clear safeword is a major issue. The author's safety should have been the domme's top priority. The domme's continuation after the safeword was triggered shows a disregard for the client's well-being.\n\nEquipment damage: The author broke a restraint during the session. However, this was a direct result of the domme's actions that caused the author to be in pain and thrashing. The domme could be at fault here for not controlling the situation properly. If the equipment broke due to the session's intensity, the responsibility might lie with the domme for not using appropriate gear or for exceeding the agreed-upon limits.\n\nThreats from the domme about not paying and spreading the word. That's a red flag. The author was in a vulnerable position and the domme is now threatening them, which adds to the justification of the author not paying and seeking medical help.\n\nThe author's response was to prioritize their health, which is the correct approach. They didn't pay for a service that was not completed properly and that resulted in injury. The domme's actions were negligent, so the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay after the fact.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
