I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored his safe word during a session.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the safe word system is. In BDSM, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. The person here used a ball in their hand as a safe word mechanism. When the ball was dropped, the domme should have stopped immediately. However, she continued kicking even after he dropped the ball, leading to significant pain and injury. \n\nThe setup was that he agreed to medium power max, but she escalated beyond that. She also restrained and gagged him, which might have impaired his ability to communicate effectively. The aftermath involved him breaking the restraints and her being upset about the equipment damage and payment.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The domme's role is to ensure the sub's safety, which she failed to do. By ignoring the safe word and exceeding agreed limits, she violated the boundaries. The user's refusal to pay is a response to her negligence and the resulting harm. \n\nNow, considering the friend's opinion that he's an asshole for not paying, that's a common scenario where someone in the community might prioritize financial obligations over safety violations. However, the primary duty in any consensual activity, especially in BDSM, is the safety and well-being of all participants. \n\nIn legal terms, if the domme acted negligently and caused harm, the user might have a valid reason to not pay and possibly seek compensation for medical expenses. However, since this is within the context of an AITA and not a legal case, the community's standards are more about ethical and moral judgment. \n\nThe domme's actions breached the trust and safety, which are fundamental in such activities. The user's decision to prioritize his health over payment is justified because the domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety measures. \n\nAdditionally, the domme threatening to damage his reputation for non-payment could be seen as an attempt to pressure him despite her own wrongdoing. This adds to the argument that she's in the wrong, and the user's refusal to pay is a legitimate response to her actions.\n"
