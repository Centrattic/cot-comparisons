I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme and a sub who had a session where the sub's safe word was ignored, leading to injury and not paying for the session.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sub paid a deposit, set up a safe word (dropping a ball), but the Domme ignored the safe word and continued to kick him beyond his agreed limits. The sub ended up in the hospital. He didn't pay the remaining balance and is being criticized by a friend who's also a Domme for not paying and breaking the restraints.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is at fault. The Domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word, and caused harm. The sub's responsibility to pay is typically part of any service agreement, but in this case, the service wasn't delivered as agreed and caused harm. The Domme also threatened to harm the sub's reputation in the community, which is aggressive.\n\nIn consensual role-play, the Domme is supposed to respect the sub's limits and safe words. If she ignored the safe word and caused injury, that's a breach of their agreement. The sub's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not performed as agreed and he was harmed. The friend's argument that the Domme pushed limits is incorrect because the sub had clearly stated his limits, which were exceeded. Also, the broken restraints might be the Domme's fault if she was too rough, so the sub isn't necessarily responsible for that cost.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed terms, ignored the safe word, and caused harm. The sub has the right to withhold payment for a service that was not delivered properly and caused injury. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
