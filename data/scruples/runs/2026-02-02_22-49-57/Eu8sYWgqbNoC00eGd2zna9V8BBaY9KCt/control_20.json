I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a BDSM session where the Domme kept going beyond the agreed limits even after the safe word was triggered, leading to significant injury.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and safe words in BDSM. Safe words are crucial for communication and stopping the scene immediately. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a major violation of agreed-upon boundaries. The author didn't pay because the Domme didn't adhere to their negotiated terms, which could be a valid reason. However, the friend of the author, who is also a domme, is saying the author should've paid anyway, which is a conflicting point. \n\nThe key points here are: the Domme breached the agreed-upon limits, ignored the safe word, caused physical harm, and the author wasn't responsible for breaking the restraints (which were part of the session setup). The Domme is expecting payment despite not following the safety protocols. Legally, in many places, payment for services rendered is expected, but the service here was not provided as agreed. The author could argue that the session was unsafe and the Domme is liable for the harm caused. However, legal nuances vary, and without a contract, it's tricky. \n\nEthically, the author isn't at fault for not paying when their safety was compromised. Also, the Domme's actions may have caused unnecessary harm, so the author is justified in withholding payment. The friend's assertion that the author is an asshole might be based on the domme community's norms, which might emphasize payment regardless, but that doesn't override the ethical issue here. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated their boundaries and didn't provide the agreed-upon service, leading to injury. The author isn't responsible for the broken restraints as they were part of the session's setup. The Domme's threats of reporting the non-payment are questionable if she didn't uphold her end of the agreement.\n"
