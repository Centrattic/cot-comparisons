I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who paid a domme for a session, agreed on limits, used a safe word (dropping a ball), but the domme ignored the safe word and continued causing pain, leading to injury. The author didn't pay the remaining fee, and the domme is threatening to tell others. The friend, who's also a domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and domme set clear limits (medium power max). The author used a safe word (dropping the ball) which the domme ignored. The domme continued causing pain, leading to the author needing medical attention. The author didn't pay the remaining $300, and the domme is upset about the broken restraints and non-payment.\n\nIn BDSM, safety and consent are paramount. The safe word is a critical part of the agreement. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a violation of the agreed-upon boundaries. The author had a right to expect that the safe word would stop the activity immediately. The domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits, which is a breach of trust and safety. \n\nThe author's decision not to pay might be justified because the service was not delivered as agreed and caused harm. The domme didn't follow the safety protocols, which could be considered negligence. The broken restraints were likely a result of the author's thrashing due to pain, which might be the domme's fault for not stopping when the safe word was triggered.\n\nHowever, the author did give a $50 deposit, and the domme provided the session, even if it was mishandled. But since the domme failed to adhere to the agreed terms (safe word and limits), the author might not be obligated to pay the remaining. The friend's argument that pushing limits is part of it might not hold because the agreed max was exceeded. The author's health is also a factor; not paying could be a way to avoid supporting unsafe practices.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying since the domme violated the safety agreement. The author prioritized their health and safety, which is the main concern. The domme is at fault for ignoring the safe word and causing harm. Therefore, the answer is B."
