I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a paid session with a domme, and the author didn't pay her because the domme ignored the safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author paid a $50 deposit out of $350. The domme didn't ask for the money upfront, which is unusual since others usually do. They set a safe word: holding a ball, and if it drops, stop. But when the pain got too much, the ball dropped, but the domme continued for three more kicks. The author ended up in the hospital, and then refused to pay the remaining $300. The friend, who's a domme, says the author is wrong because the domme pushed limits and the author didn't pay, breaking the straps.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the domme violate the safety agreement? The author argues she ignored the safe word and caused harm. The domme argues that pushing limits is part of the role. Also, the contract terms: if the session was agreed upon, and the author didn't complete the payment, is that a breach?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if they had a contract (even verbal), and the author didn't pay, the domme might have a claim. But from an ethical standpoint, the domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures, which is a major issue. The author's health and safety are critical. The safe word is supposed to be respected, and ignoring it is a serious breach of trust and safety protocols.\n\nEven if the domme claims it's part of the play, the author's well-being is paramount. In such situations, the domme has a responsibility to stop immediately upon the safe word. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't delivered properly. However, the friend's argument is that the domme provided the service, even if it was intense, but the author broke the agreement by not paying.\n\nBut the main issue is safety. The domme's actions led to the author needing medical attention. If the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures, then she's at fault. The author's right to their safety should take precedence over payment. Also, the deposit might be a point\u2014did the author have to pay the full amount regardless? If the session was terminated due to the domme's failure to adhere to the safety protocol, the author isn't obligated to pay the remaining amount. The broken restraints were caused by the domme's actions (the author's reaction to the continued pain), so the domme might have responsibility for that as well.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the safety agreement. The author's decision to not pay was a result of the domme's breach of terms and endangerment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
