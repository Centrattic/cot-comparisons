I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, the setup: The Domme set up a session with a safe word system where the sub would hold a ball, and dropping it meant she should stop. The sub agreed to medium intensity, but the Domme went beyond that, causing significant pain. The sub dropped the ball, but she kept going for three more kicks. He ended up injured, went to the hospital, and decided not to pay because she violated the safe word. The Domme is now threatening to report him for not paying and damaging her equipment.\n\nThe key points here are the safe word and the agreed-upon limits. In any consensual power exchange, especially in BDSM, the safe word is a critical part of the agreement. The Domme's responsibility is to respect the sub's limits and stop immediately when the safe word is triggered. By continuing after the safe word was clearly given, she violated the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe sub had the right to stop the session when their safety and well-being were compromised. The Domme's actions led to the injury, so she was at fault. The sub's refusal to pay is a reasonable response since the service wasn't provided as agreed. The friend's opinion that the sub is in the wrong is likely because of the community's expectations, but in this case, the Domme breached the contract and caused harm. \n\nAlso, the sub didn't pay upfront, only a deposit, so the remaining amount was for the service, which wasn't delivered safely. The broken equipment was a result of the Domme's actions, so she can't hold the sub responsible for that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n"
