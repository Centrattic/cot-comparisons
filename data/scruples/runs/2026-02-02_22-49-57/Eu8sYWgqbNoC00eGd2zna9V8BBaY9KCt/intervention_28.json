I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who paid a domme for a session, set a safe word (dropping a ball), but the domme continued after the safe word was triggered. The author didn't pay the remaining amount and the domme is threatening to report them.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the safe word was properly communicated and if the domme ignored it. The user mentioned they told the domme their limits and the safe word. The domme then went beyond the agreed limits and didn't stop when the safe word was used. That's a breach of the agreed terms.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The author paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. The domme didn't ask for payment upfront. If the session was terminated early due to the domme's negligence, the author might not be obligated to pay the full amount. The remaining $300 could be considered a deposit if the session wasn't completed as agreed.\n\nThe friend (also a domme) says the author is an asshole for not paying. But if the service wasn't delivered properly because of the domme's actions, the author isn't at fault. The domme's responsibility is to follow the agreed limits and stop when the safe word is used. By continuing, she violated the terms, so the author isn't in the wrong for withholding payment.\n\nAlso, the author was injured and went to the hospital, which is a serious consequence. The domme's actions could be negligent, so the author's decision to not pay and seek medical help makes sense. The domme's threats to report the author for non-payment might be baseless if the service wasn't provided correctly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
