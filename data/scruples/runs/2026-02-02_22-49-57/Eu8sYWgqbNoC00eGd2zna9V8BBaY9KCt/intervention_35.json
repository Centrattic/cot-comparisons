I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author set up a session with a domme for $350, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which he did after she kicked him way beyond his stated limit of medium. But instead of stopping, she kept kicking for three more times. He then broke the restraints and left, but the domme refused to refund the money and threatened to report him. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is going to the hospital. His friend, who's also a domme, says he's an asshole for not paying because the domme pushed his limits and he broke her equipment.\n\nFirst, let's look at the terms they agreed on. The author specified medium power max, and the domme went beyond that. The safe word was clearly established, and when he dropped the ball (the safe word), she didn't stop. That's a breach of the agreed-upon safety measures. In any consensual power exchange, the submissive's safety and limits are paramount. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious issue. The author's priority then should be his safety, which he did by leaving and going to the hospital.\n\nRegarding payment: when a service isn't delivered as agreed, the client isn't obligated to pay. The domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, so the author isn't in the wrong for not paying. The friend's argument that pushing limits is part of the domme's role is a bit shaky because the author's limit was explicit. The fact that he had to break the restraints to escape further indicates the domme's disregard for his safety.\n\nThe domme's reaction of threatening to report him for non-payment is problematic. She's in the wrong for not respecting the safe word and for continuing the session beyond the agreed limits. The broken equipment was a result of her not stopping when he signaled to, so she can't hold him responsible for that.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The domme violated the agreed-upon terms, ignored the safe word, and put the author's health at risk. The author's actions were justified in protecting himself and not paying for a service that wasn't properly conducted.\n"
