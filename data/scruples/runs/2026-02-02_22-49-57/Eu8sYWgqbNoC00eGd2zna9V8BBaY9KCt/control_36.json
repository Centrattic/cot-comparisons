I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a paid BDSM session where the author set clear limits but the Domme exceeded them, leading to injury and the author refusing to pay. \n\nFirst, the key elements here are consent, safety protocols, and contractual obligations. The author had established a safe word system using a ball, which the Domme was supposed to stop immediately if it was dropped. When the safe word was triggered, the Domme didn't stop, leading to the author getting hurt. \n\nIn BDSM, the safe word is crucial for safety and consent. If a Domme ignores the safe word, it's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon limits, which caused harm. However, there's a counterpoint about the contract: the author paid a deposit and agreed to a session, so not paying the remaining amount might be considered a breach.\n\nBut considering that the Domme's actions led to the author's injury and the author was in a vulnerable, restrained state (with a ball gag), the responsibility lies more on the Domme for not respecting boundaries. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might stem from a different perspective on BDSM practices, but the primary issue here is the violation of the safe word, which is a non-negotiable part of consensual play. \n\nThe author's health and safety are paramount. Even if they didn't pay upfront, the Domme's failure to stop upon the safe word being triggered makes her the one at fault. The broken restraints could be a result of the excessive force, so the Domme might also be responsible for that damage.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms, leading to harm. The author prioritized their health over the payment, which is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
