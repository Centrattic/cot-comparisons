I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a domination session where the author didn't pay a domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, let's look at the agreed-upon terms. The author set up a session with a safeword system where dropping the ball would signal to stop. The domme didn't stop when the safeword was triggered, which led to the author experiencing significant pain and injury. The author didn't pay because they felt the domme violated their agreed-upon limits and caused harm.\n\nNow, the domme argues that she pushed the author's limits and that they should still pay, plus compensate for broken equipment. But the key here is the safeword. In any consensual roleplay, especially in activities with potential for harm, respecting safewords is crucial. Ignoring the safeword goes against the mutual agreement and can lead to harm, which was the case here. The author's safety was compromised, leading to physical injury. The domme's actions could be considered negligent or even reckless, especially since the author communicated their limits beforehand.\n\nThe friend, who is also a domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying. But if the domme broke the agreement by ignoring the safeword, the author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not rendered properly. The author was harmed, and the session ended prematurely due to the domme's negligence. The broken restraints might have been due to the author's distress from the pain, not their fault. \n\nLegally, if the domme didn't provide the agreed-upon service (following the safeword), the author might not be obligated to pay. Ethically, the domme violated the trust and terms, leading to harm. The author's decision to seek medical attention and not pay seems justified given the circumstances. The domme's threat to ruin the author's reputation in the community is also problematic because it's retaliation for not paying under questionable circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They prioritized their safety, which is paramount, and the domme's actions breached the agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
