I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop after the sub (the person submitting) used their safe word, leading to the sub not paying for the session. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sub set up a session with a Domme, agreed on a safe word system involving a ball. When the pain became too much, the sub dropped the ball (the safe word signal), but the Domme continued, causing severe pain and injury. The sub then left without paying, citing the Domme's failure to respect the safe word. The Domme is now threatening to report the sub for non-payment and equipment damage.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the sub) is in the wrong for not paying. \n\nIn BDSM communities, safety protocols like safe words are crucial. They are a fundamental part of consent and ensuring that all activities remain consensual and safe. The Domme's role is to respect the sub's limits and stop immediately when a safe word is used. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, the Domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries. This could be considered a breach of trust and possibly illegal if it led to harm, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nThe sub's refusal to pay could be justified on the grounds that the service provided was outside the agreed terms and caused harm. Additionally, the sub was injured, which might be a factor. However, typically, even in cases of dissatisfaction, people pay for services rendered unless there was explicit agreement otherwise or a legal claim (like negligence causing injury).\n\nBut in this case, the Domme didn't stop when the safe word was used, which is a serious violation. The sub's priority would be their health and safety. The friend (another Domme) says the sub should have paid, but that might be from a community standard where payment is expected regardless, but from a legal or ethical standpoint, if the service was not provided as agreed, the sub might not have an obligation to pay. \n\nAlso, the sub mentions the Domme's threat to report them, which could be harassment. The sub's actions (not paying and going to the hospital) seem to be protecting their own well-being. \n\nHowever, the sub did break the restraints, which the Domme claims caused damage. But the sub's breaking free was in response to the Domme not honoring the safe word, so the damage might be the Domme's fault for not controlling the situation properly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the Domme is at fault for continuing after the safe word, which is a serious breach. The sub is not in the wrong for not paying because the service was not delivered as agreed, and the sub was harmed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
