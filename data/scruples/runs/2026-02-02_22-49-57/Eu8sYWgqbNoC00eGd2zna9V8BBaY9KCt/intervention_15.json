I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid dominatrix session where the author didn't pay after their safe word was ignored, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed their limits. They agreed on a safe word system: holding a ball, and if they dropped it, the domme would stop. However, during the session, the domme exceeded the agreed-upon intensity, the author dropped the ball (triggering the safe word), but the domme continued, causing severe pain and possible injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to the domme threatening to report them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, and I need to assess that. Let's consider the responsibilities of both parties. The domme's job is to respect the client's boundaries and stop if the safe word is triggered. By continuing after the safe word was indicated, she violated the agreed terms. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not delivered as contracted\u2014specifically, the domme didn't adhere to the safety agreement. Additionally, the author was injured, which is a serious issue. The friend's opinion that the author should pay because the domme pushed their limits might not hold, as pushing beyond agreed limits without consent is a breach of trust and safety.\n\nAnother angle: the legal aspect. While this isn't a legal forum, typically in service agreements, if one party doesn't fulfill their part (in this case, the domme providing the service within the agreed terms), the other party isn't obligated to pay. The author's safety and well-being are paramount, and the domme's negligence could be seen as a failure to provide the service properly.\n\nThe domme's response of threatening to harm the author's reputation in the community might be a red flag, indicating possible bad faith on her part. The author's priority was medical attention, which is understandable after potential injury.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the domme didn't honor the safe word, caused harm, and the author is not obligated to pay for a service that was not conducted as agreed. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
