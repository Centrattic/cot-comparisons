I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author paid $350 for a 90-minute session with a domme. They discussed limits, specifically mentioning light to medium ballbusting. They set up a safe word system using a ball: if he dropped it, she should stop immediately. However, during the session, she went beyond the agreed-upon intensity. He dropped the ball (the safe word) but she continued for three more kicks. He ended up in severe pain, broke a restraint, and was told to pay the remaining $300. He refused, citing her ignoring the safe word and the danger, then went to the hospital. His friend, another domme, is upset he didn't pay and broke the equipment.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the safe word and the agreed limits. The safe word system is a standard practice in BDSM to ensure that the submissive can communicate their discomfort or pain. The fact that the domme ignored the safe word (the dropped ball) is a major red flag. Even if the domme believed she was within her role, she had a responsibility to stop immediately upon the safe word being triggered. Continuing after that could be considered a breach of trust and potentially negligent, especially leading to physical harm (swollen testicles requiring a hospital visit).\n\nThe author's refusal to pay the remaining $300 is based on the domme's failure to adhere to the agreed terms and the resulting harm. The domme's response of threatening to spread the word about non-payment might not be a valid reason for the author to pay, as the service was not delivered as agreed. The broken restraint is a separate issue; if it was due to the domme's actions exceeding the agreed intensity, the responsibility might lie with her for not respecting the limits.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole is conflicting. But in the context of the domme not following safety protocols and causing harm, the author's actions seem justified. The safe word was ignored, leading to injury, and the author rightfully prioritized their health over payment. Additionally, the domme's threats post-incident may not be a legal or ethical argument for payment.\n\nLegally, if there's a contract (even verbal) that the domme violated by not respecting the safe word and causing harm, the author might have a case against her. However, in terms of moral responsibility, the domme's actions were a breach of trust and safety agreements, making the author's refusal to pay understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because the domme failed to honor the agreed-upon limits and safe word, leading to harm. The author's priority was their health and safety, which is the primary concern in any consent-based activity. The domme's actions were a violation of the terms, so the author's decision to not pay is justified."
