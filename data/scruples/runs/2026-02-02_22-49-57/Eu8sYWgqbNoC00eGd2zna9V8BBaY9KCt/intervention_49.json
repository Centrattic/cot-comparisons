I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author paid a deposit for a session with a Domme. They agreed on limits for ballbusting, specifically medium power max. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would make the Domme stop immediately. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, causing the author severe pain and injury. When the author dropped the ball (their safe word), the Domme didn't stop and continued, leading the author to almost pass out. They didn't pay the remaining $300 and left to the hospital. The Domme then accused them of not paying and threatening to report them to the community.\n\nThe user's friend, who's also a Domme, said the author was an asshole for not paying, arguing that the Domme was just pushing limits and the author broke her equipment. The author is seeking if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the context of BDSM play, there's a strong emphasis on safety, consent, and communication. Safe words are supposed to be respected as a non-negotiable part of the agreement. If the Domme ignored the safe word and caused harm, she violated the terms of the session. The author's decision not to pay could be justified because the service provided was not as agreed, and they suffered injury. \n\nHowever, in some communities, especially consensual power exchange, there might be different expectations. The Domme's argument could be that she was following the agreed limits, but the author claims she exceeded them. The key points here are whether the safe word was properly communicated and followed, and if the injury was due to her negligence. \n\nIf the Domme knowingly ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's priority was their health, which overrides the payment obligation. The Domme's equipment damage might be a separate issue, but if she caused harm, the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme's actions were unsafe and against the agreed terms. Not paying is a reasonable response when the service provider fails to meet the agreed safety standards and causes harm.\n"
