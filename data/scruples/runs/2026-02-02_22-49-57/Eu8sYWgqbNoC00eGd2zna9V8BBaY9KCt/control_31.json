I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. So I need to analyze the situation carefully. \n\nFirst, the context is about a 50-something person who had a session with a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) and didn't pay her after the session because they felt the Domme ignored their safe word. The person set up a session for 90 minutes, paid a $50 deposit. They discussed limits, specifically medium power max for ballbusting. The safe word arrangement was holding a ball, and dropping it meant the Domme should stop immediately. However, the Domme continued even after the ball was dropped, leading to severe pain and injury. The person then broke a restraint to stop the action, and when the Domme found out, she was angry about the broken equipment and demanded the remaining $300. The person refuses to pay because the Domme didn't follow the safe word, ends up at the hospital, and a friend domme says they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nSo the key points here are: \n\n1. The service agreement was for a specific type of activity (ballbusting) with agreed limits (medium power max).\n2. A safe word was established, with a clear signal (dropping the ball). The Domme ignored this, leading to the person's injury.\n3. The person felt they had no choice but to break the restraints to stop the pain, which caused damage to the equipment.\n4. The Domme is now demanding the remaining payment and threatening to tell the community about the non-payment.\n5. The person's friend, a domme, argues that they should pay regardless because the Domme pushed their limits as part of the role.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the service was paid for, but the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety protocol. The safe word is a critical part of any BDSM session, and if the Domme didn't respect it, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The person had the right to stop the session if their safety was compromised. The damages to the equipment were a result of the Domme's failure to follow the safe word, so expecting payment for the full session when the service was not provided as agreed (with safety measures) is questionable. Additionally, the person didn't actually receive the full 90 minutes of service as the session was cut short due to the Domme's negligence. \n\nOn the other hand, the Domme might argue that the person wasn't able to hold the ball and that the safe word wasn't clear. But given that the person had a physical reaction (dropping the ball) which was agreed as a signal, the Domme should have stopped immediately. The friend domme's perspective might be that once the session starts, the Domme has the right to push limits, but that's more about the roleplay aspect. However, if the safe word was established, the Domme is responsible for respecting it, regardless of the role. \n\nSo, the person didn't pay because the service was not properly delivered (safety ignored, causing harm), and the Domme is now holding them responsible for equipment damage, which was a result of her actions. Therefore, the person is not in the wrong for refusing to pay after such a violation. The correct answer should be B.\n"
