I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a paid session where the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word protocol. The user set up a session with clear limits and a safe word (dropping a ball). The Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, and continued causing severe pain. The user didn't pay and is getting criticism from a friend who's also a domme.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if the safe word was part of the agreed terms, and the Domme violated that, then she breached the contract. The user isn't obligated to pay for services not rendered properly. Also, the user suffered physical harm, which could be a red flag for the Domme's professionalism. The friend's advice that the user is an \"asshole\" seems to come from a place of loyalty to the domme community rather than objective analysis.\n\nEthically, the Domme's actions were dangerous and disregarded the user's safety. The user's right to stop the session when in danger is valid. The broken restraints were likely due to the Domme's excessive force, not the user's fault. The Domme is at fault for causing damage to her own equipment through her actions.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The Domme failed to meet the agreed terms and put the user in harm's way. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
