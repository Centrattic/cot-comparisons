I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author is into ballbusting and set up a session with a domme for $350. They paid a $50 deposit and discussed limits, with the safe word being dropping a ball. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed \"medium power,\" leading the author to drop the ball (their safe word) but she continued, causing severe pain. The author ended up in the hospital. The domme is now demanding the remaining $300, and the author refuses to pay, leading to the domme threatening to blackball them in the community.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreed-upon limits, the use of a safe word, and the domme's actions exceeding those. The author's main argument is that the domme ignored the safe word and went beyond the agreed limits, making the situation dangerous. The friend, another domme, says that the author should have paid because the domme pushed their limits, implying that the author didn't communicate properly or perhaps the domme was just doing her job.\n\nBut the author clearly stated their limits as medium power. The domme agreed to restrain and gag the author, but then proceeded to kick and knee with more force than agreed. The safe word was a physical signal (dropping the ball), which the author used, but the domme didn't stop. That's a serious breach of the agreed terms. The domme's continued actions after the safe word was triggered could be seen as neglecting the author's safety, which is a fundamental part of any consensual power exchange. The fact that the author ended up in the hospital suggests that the domme's actions caused harm, even if it wasn't intentional.\n\nIn such scenarios, the safe word is supposed to halt everything immediately. If the domme ignored that, she violated the trust and agreed-upon safety measures. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not delivered as agreed. The domme's response\u2014yelling, blaming the author for breaking equipment, and demanding payment\u2014seems to be deflecting responsibility. The author's friend being a domme and advising payment might come from a different perspective, possibly prioritizing the community's expectations over the actual harm caused. However, the friend's opinion might not take into account the negligence of the domme in this specific case.\n\nLegally, if the domme caused harm beyond the agreed terms, the author might have a case, but that's a different angle. Ethically, the domme failed to adhere to the established boundaries and safety protocols. The author's decision not to pay arises from the domme's breach of the agreement and the resulting harm. The domme's threats about the community could be a form of coercion, which is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The domme's actions were the problem here. The author followed the safe word as agreed, and the domme didn't, leading to injury. The author's refusal to pay is a reasonable response to a service that was not conducted as agreed and resulted in harm. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
