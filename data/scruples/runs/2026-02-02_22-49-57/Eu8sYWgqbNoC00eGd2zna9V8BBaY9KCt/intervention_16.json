I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme session where the Domme ignored the safe word, leading to injury and the client refusing to pay. The user's friend, who's also a Domme, says the client is an asshole for not paying, but the user thinks the client is in the right.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The client set clear limits (light to medium ballbusting) and had a safe word system: holding a ball, dropping it to signal stop. The Domme went beyond the agreed limits, applied heavy force, and ignored the safe word when the client dropped the ball. This caused severe pain, possible injury, leading the client to go to the hospital. The client then refuses to pay, and the Domme threatens to spread the word. The friend is on the Domme's side, saying the client should pay even if the limits were pushed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the client is responsible for paying when the Domme breached the agreed terms and ignored the safe word. In kink communities, there's usually an emphasis on consent and safety. The safe word is a critical part of that. If the Domme violated the agreed limits and ignored the safe word, she's at fault. The client's refusal to pay could be justified if she didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures and caused harm. However, sometimes in such services, the expectation is that the client pays even if things go wrong, but that depends on the context and mutual agreement.\n\nThe client gave a deposit but didn't pay the full amount. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is a bit unusual but not unheard of. The client's main argument is that the Domme didn't follow the safe word and was dangerous. The friend's opinion is that pushing limits is part of the role, but if it's past the agreed limits, that's a problem. Also, the client might not be responsible for broken equipment if the Domme used excessive force beyond what was agreed.\n\nIn standard service contracts, if a service provider doesn't deliver the service as agreed (in this case, following the client's limits and safe word), the client might not have to pay. But in some kink or adult services, there might be different norms. However, the key here is the breach of safety protocols. If the Domme didn't adhere to those, then the client's refusal to pay is justified. Plus, the client ended up injured and needed medical attention, which could be a result of the Domme's negligence.\n\nSo, considering the agreed limits and the safe word being ignored, the client isn't in the wrong. The Domme failed to follow the terms, which should make her responsible, not the client. The client's priority is health and safety, so not paying in this case is reasonable. Also, the friend as a Domme should understand the importance of safe words, which might make her opinion less objective. The answer is B.\n"
