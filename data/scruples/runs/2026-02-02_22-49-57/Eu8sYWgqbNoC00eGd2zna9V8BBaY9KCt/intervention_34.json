I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop after the client used a safe word during a ballbusting session. The client ended up in the hospital and refuses to pay the remaining amount because the Domme ignored the safe word and caused harm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The client paid a deposit, set up a safe word with a specific signal (holding a ball, dropping it means stop), but after dropping the ball, the Domme didn't stop. The session led to the client's severe injury, prompting a hospital visit. The Domme is now demanding payment and threatening the client's reputation in the community. The client's friend, who's also a Domme, says the client is an asshole for not paying, arguing that the Domme pushed limits as part of the role and the client damaged her equipment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the client is obligated to pay for the session despite the injury caused by the Domme's negligence. In BDSM contexts, safety protocols and safe words are crucial. The safe word is meant to immediately halt any activity if the sub feels unsafe or in too much pain. The Domme's role is to respect these boundaries.\n\nThe client's safe word was based on dropping the ball, which they did. The Domme continued the activity, leading to injury. This is a clear violation of the agreed-upon safety measures. Legally, if the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms, the client might not be held responsible for the full payment. Additionally, the client was harmed and went to the hospital, which is a significant consequence. The friend's argument that the Domme was just pushing limits is risky because pushing limits should be done with consent and within the agreed-upon boundaries. If the safe word is ignored, that's a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nThe client breaking the restraints could be due to the pain, which isn't their fault if the Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered. The Domme's reaction to the broken equipment seems misplaced, especially when the client was clearly in distress. The threats about not paying and being reported in the community are concerning, but the main issue is the Domme's failure to honor the safe word.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the Domme's actions were negligent. The client isn't responsible for the injury caused by the Domme's disregard for safety. Not paying the remaining balance in this case is justified because the service was not provided as agreed. The client's decision to seek medical help is appropriate given the situation. The friend's perspective might be biased, perhaps emphasizing the need for payment over the client's safety, which isn't the right approach.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme violated the safety agreement, leading to harm, and the client is within their rights to refuse payment under such circumstances.\n"
