I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is at fault for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity (medium max), causing severe pain. He dropped the ball (the safe word signal) but she kept kicking him. He ended up injured and didn't pay the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to report him to the community for not paying, and his friend (another Domme) is saying he's in the wrong for not paying and breaking her equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a consensual power exchange scenario, like in BDSM. In such practices, safety is paramount, and safe words are supposed to be respected as non-negotiable. The user set clear limits (medium power max) and established a safe word system. The Domme, despite being experienced, ignored the safe word and exceeded the agreed intensity, leading to injury. \n\nIn consensual activities, especially those involving physical activity, the dominant partner is expected to prioritize the submissive's physical and emotional well-being. By ignoring the safe word and causing harm, the Domme breached the trust and safety agreement. The user's decision not to pay can be seen as a response to her negligence, which resulted in his injury. \n\nAdditionally, the user didn't pay the full amount upfront, only a deposit. If the service was not provided as agreed (or if it was harmful), it's reasonable that he wouldn't pay the rest. The Domme's reaction of threatening to report him for non-payment seems unfair because she failed to uphold her end of the agreement safely. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the user is a \"huge asshole\" might be based on the idea that services rendered should be paid for, regardless of outcome. However, in this case, the service was not delivered as agreed, and the Domme caused harm. Ethically, the user isn't in the wrong because the Domme's actions were reckless and violated the agreed-upon safety measures. \n\nAlso, from a legal standpoint, if someone causes injury through negligence, the injured party isn't obligated to pay for services that resulted in harm. The user's priority was his health, which is reasonable. The Domme's loss of equipment could be a separate issue, but the immediate responsibility lies with her for not adhering to safety protocols.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word and cause injury justifies the user's decision not to pay.\n"
