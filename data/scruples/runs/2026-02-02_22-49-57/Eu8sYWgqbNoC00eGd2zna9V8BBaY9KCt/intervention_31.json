I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not paying a dominatrix after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: they arranged a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and set a safe word using a ball. The safe word was dropping the ball, which would signal her to stop immediately. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed medium power, causing extreme pain. The user dropped the ball multiple times, but the domme continued, leading to injury and a broken restraint. The domme then asked for the remaining $300 and threatened to report them for non-payment. The user refused to pay and went to the hospital.\n\nThe user's friend, another domme, says they should have paid, arguing that the domme pushed their limits and the user damaged the equipment. But the key points here are the violation of the agreed-upon safe word and the domme's failure to adhere to the user's stated limits. The safe word is a fundamental part of any consensual power exchange arrangement. If the domme ignored the safe word, she breached the agreement, making the service incomplete and potentially dangerous. The user was harmed due to her disregard, so they are justified in not paying for a service that was not delivered as agreed and that caused harm. The broken restraint might be a separate issue, but the domme's responsibility to follow the safe word overrides that. The user's refusal to pay is a reasonable response to a violation of trust and safety. So, the answer is B.\n"
