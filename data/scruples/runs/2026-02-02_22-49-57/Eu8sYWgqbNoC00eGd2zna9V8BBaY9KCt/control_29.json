I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a consensual power exchange dynamic, specifically with a Domme (dominant) and a sub (the author). The key points here are the use of a safe word and the consequences following the session.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme, paying a deposit and discussing limits. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball in hand. During the session, the Domme ignored the safe word after the author dropped the ball, leading to further punishment. The author suffered pain, broke restraints, and later refused to pay the remaining fee, leading to the Domme threatening to inform the community.\n\nNow, the central issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying. The Domme's actions: she ignored the agreed-upon safe word, which is a fundamental part of consent and safety in such dynamics. By continuing the punishment after the safe word was triggered, she potentially breached the trust and safety boundaries. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service didn't adhere to the agreed terms, and the client was harmed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should still pay because services were rendered, even if there was a problem. But in this case, the Domme didn't follow the safety protocols they had previously discussed. The author's friend (another Domme) says they should pay, but maybe that's from a different perspective, possibly within their community's norms. Legally and ethically, if a service provider fails to meet the agreed terms and causes harm, the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount, especially if there's a breach of contract or safety.\n\nAdditionally, the author's health was at risk, and they went to the hospital. That's a significant factor. The Domme's behavior of threatening to spread the word about non-payment might be an attempt to pressure the client, but if the service was inadequate and unsafe, the client isn't necessarily in the wrong for withholding payment.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme failed to respect the boundaries, leading to harm, and the author's refusal to pay is a response to that breach. Answer B.\n"
