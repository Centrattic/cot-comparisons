I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (dominant partner) who didn't stop when the author used their safe word during a ballbusting session. The author didn't pay the full amount, and the Domme is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author agreed to a session with specific limits: light to medium ballbusting. They set a safe word using a ball in their hand, which the Domme was supposed to notice when it was dropped. However, when the author dropped the ball (safe word), the Domme continued the activity, causing significant pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300 because the Domme violated their agreement by ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The Domme is threatening the author with repercussions in the domme community for not paying and the broken restraints.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not paying. The Domme's perspective is that she pushed the author's limits, which is part of the dynamic, and the author damaged her equipment and owes money. The author's side is that the Domme broke the agreed-upon safety rules, leading to injury, and thus they shouldn't have to pay.\n\nIn consensual activities like BDSM, safety is paramount. Safe words are a critical part of the agreement to ensure that either party can stop the session immediately. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. The author's physical reaction\u2014almost passing out, difficulty breathing, and needing to go to the hospital\u2014indicates that the Domme's actions were beyond the negotiated intensity. The fact that the author's friend, another domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying suggests a possible community expectation, but that doesn't override safety and consent issues.\n\nThe Domme was supposed to respect the author's limits and the safe word. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, she endangered the author's health. The author has a right to expect that their safety word is honored, and not paying seems justified if the terms of the session were violated. The broken restraints might be a result of the author's distress, but that's the Domme's responsibility if she continued despite the safe word. The threat to involve the domme community doesn't absolve her of the mistake of ignoring the safe word.\n\nAdditionally, the author went to the hospital, which is a responsible action given the injury. The Domme's response of being angry about the unpaid money and the broken gear seems secondary to the initial failure to respect the safe word and the resulting harm. Legally, if there was an agreement for the session, not paying might be an issue, but if the service wasn't completed properly, the author could have grounds to withhold payment. However, this is a gray area. The ethical aspect is clearer: the Domme's actions were unsafe, so the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay.\n"
