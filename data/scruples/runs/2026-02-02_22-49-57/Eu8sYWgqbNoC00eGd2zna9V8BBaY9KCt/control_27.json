I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a domme session where the author didn't pay because the domme ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author set up a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a safe word system using a ball. The safe word was dropping the ball, which would stop the session. However, the domme continued after he dropped the ball, causing him severe pain and injury. He then didn't pay the remaining $300 and was told the domme would spread negative info about him if he didn't pay.\n\nThe friend, another domme, says he's in the wrong for not paying and breaking the straps. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, considering the use of a safe word, which is a standard practice in BDSM to ensure safety. The domme ignored the safe word, which is a breach of agreed-upon safety measures. The author had a legitimate reason to not pay because the domme didn't follow the established boundaries. The injury he sustained also adds to the argument that the domme was negligent. \n\nOn the other hand, the service was provided (even if improperly), so the domme might claim the payment is due. But since the safe word was ignored, which is a major safety violation, the author's refusal to pay could be justified. The friend's opinion that he's a douche might be from a domme's perspective where payment is expected regardless, but the safety breach is a bigger issue.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The refusal to pay is a response to that violation. So the answer should be B.\n"
