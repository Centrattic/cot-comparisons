I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid dominatrix (Domme) session where the author didn't pay the remaining $300 because the Domme allegedly ignored a safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points: \n\n1. **Agreement and Safety Protocols**: The author and Domme had a prior agreement about the safeword, which was dropping a ball. The Domme was supposed to stop immediately if that happened. However, when the author dropped the ball (after three powerful kicks beyond the agreed \"medium power\"), the Domme continued for three more kicks and ignored the safeword. This is a critical point because the safe word is a fundamental part of consensual power exchange in such activities. The Domme's failure to adhere to this could be a violation of the agreed-upon safety measures.\n\n2. **Physical Harm and Immediate Consequences**: The author experienced significant pain and feared injury, leading them to the hospital. While the physical harm wasn't permanent, the fact that the Domme exceeded the agreed-upon limits and ignored a clear safeword suggests negligence or recklessness on her part. \n\n3. **Financial Responsibility**: The author paid a $50 deposit and agreed to a $350 session. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is unusual but not necessarily wrong. However, the author didn't pay the remaining $300, citing the Domme's failure to follow safety protocols. The friend (also a Domme) argues that the author is still obligated to pay because the session occurred and the Domme provided her service. But in such consensual activities, the safety of the sub is paramount. If the Domme breached the agreed-upon safety terms, the author might not be obligated to pay the full amount, especially if it was a contractual or ethical violation.\n\n4. **Breach of Trust and Legal/Ethical Considerations**: The Domme's actions could be considered a breach of the agreed terms, which might void the contract or ethical obligation to pay. Additionally, the Domme's response (yelling and threatening to report the non-payment) seems aggressive and potentially punitive, which adds to the argument that the author had a valid reason to withhold payment.\n\n5. **Fetish and Consent Context**: The scenario is within a consensual adult fetish context, but consent is only valid when the agreed-upon boundaries are respected. The Domme's actions went beyond the negotiated limits, which could be a violation of consent. In such cases, the sub has the right to revoke consent, and the Domme should respect that.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the Domme's failure to honor the safe word and exceeding the agreed intensity levels likely places the responsibility on her for not adhering to the terms of the session. The author's decision not to pay the remaining amount because of this breach could be justified, especially given the potential for harm and the violation of trust. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
