I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. The story is about a session where the Domme didn't respect the safe word, leading to the person getting hurt and going to the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules about consensual activities and safe words. Safe words are crucial in any consensual power exchange scenarios, like in BDSM or role-playing activities. They're meant to be a clear, agreed-upon signal to stop the activity immediately if the person is in pain or wants to end the session. \n\nThe person set up the session, paid a deposit, and discussed their limits. The safe word was using a ball in their hand, and if it drops, the Domme should stop. But when they dropped the ball due to pain, the Domme didn't stop, continued for three more kicks, and then started yelling about the broken restraint. The person didn't pay the remaining $300 and is now being criticized by their friend, who's also a domme, for not paying and breaking the equipment.\n\nNow, the main question is: is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Consent and Safe Word Violation**: The Domme ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental breach of the agreed terms. If the safe word isn't respected, the activity isn't consensual anymore, especially when it leads to injury. That's a big red flag.\n\n2. **Injury and Hospitalization**: The person ended up with significant swelling and pain, leading to a hospital visit. Even if the injury wasn't permanent, the act of causing harm when a safe word is used is a serious issue. \n\n3. **Deposit vs. Full Payment**: They paid a $50 deposit. The question is whether the deposit is a non-refundable fee for the session regardless of the outcome, or if it's refundable if the session wasn't conducted properly. If the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety measures, the person might not be obligated to pay the full amount. \n\n4. **Friend's Perspective**: The friend, who's a domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying. But that might be from a community standard where once a session starts, you pay regardless. However, those standards shouldn't override the safety and well-being of the participant. \n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: If someone causes harm to another by ignoring their safe word, they could be held responsible. The person not paying could be a way to seek some form of redress, especially if they feel the session wasn't properly conducted. \n\n6. **Broken Equipment**: The friend claims the broken straps cost her money. However, the breaking was a result of the person being in pain and thrashing, which the Domme caused by not stopping. So the domme might be at fault for pushing beyond the limits leading to the accident.\n\nIn many cases, especially in consensual activities, the safety and boundaries of the sub are paramount. If the Domme didn't respect those, the person has a right to protect themselves and not fulfill the payment agreement. The domme could be liable if it's proven she acted recklessly, but since this is a personal service and perhaps not a legal contract, the situation is a bit gray. However, the author's main point is about the violation of the safe word leading to injury, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe community standards might prioritize payment, but when a safety protocol is breached resulting in harm, the ethical responsibility shifts. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not paying because the session was conducted without respecting the agreed terms. The domme's actions could be considered negligent, and withholding payment as a form of protest might be justified, especially if there's no legal contract binding them. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the safe word violation and the resulting injury, which are more critical than the payment expectation in a non-legal agreement context.\n"
