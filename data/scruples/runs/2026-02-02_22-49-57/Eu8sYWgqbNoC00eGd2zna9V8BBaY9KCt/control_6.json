I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a domme, paying a $50 deposit and agreeing to a $350 total. They discussed their limits for ballbusting, specifying medium power max. The safe word was using a ball in their hand\u2014if they dropped it, the domme would stop. But during the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, even after the author dropped the ball (their safe word). The author then tried to defend themselves, broke a restraint, and ended up needing medical attention. They refused to pay the remaining $300 because the domme didn't respect their safe word and caused harm. The domme is threatening to tell the community the author didn't pay, and a friend domme says the author is an asshole for not paying.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider consent and safety in BDSM practices. Safe words are crucial in these activities to ensure that the submissive can communicate their limits and stop the action if needed. If the domme ignored the safe word (the author dropping the ball), that's a serious breach of protocol. The author's well-being and safety are paramount, and the domme's actions led to physical harm, necessitating a hospital visit. \n\nHowever, the author didn't pay the full amount. The domme might argue that the session was agreed upon for $350, and the author is backing out because they didn't like the outcome. The deposit of $50 could be a point here\u2014some services require a deposit and still expect the full payment even if the session is terminated early, depending on the terms. But the key issue is the domme's disregard for the safe word and the resulting injury. \n\nIn typical BDSM dynamics, the domme is expected to prioritize the sub's safety. If she didn't do that, the author has the right to not pay for a service that was not delivered as agreed and potentially harmful. Plus, the author was in physical distress, which could be a reason to not fulfill the payment obligation. The friend domme's opinion might be biased, as she's part of the same community and might have different expectations, but the core issue is the violation of the agreed-upon safe word and the resulting harm. \n\nOn the other hand, if the safe word system was not clearly communicated or if the domme misunderstood the signal, maybe there's some ambiguity. But the author mentioned that the safe word was holding a ball, and if they dropped it, the session would stop. The domme didn't act on that, so it's a clear case of ignoring the safe word. \n\nTherefore, the author's refusal to pay stems from the domme not respecting their boundaries, which is a significant ethical and safety issue. The author prioritizing their health and safety over paying for a session that wasn't properly conducted seems justified. The domme should have honored the safe word, and the author isn't obligated to pay for negligence or harm caused. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
