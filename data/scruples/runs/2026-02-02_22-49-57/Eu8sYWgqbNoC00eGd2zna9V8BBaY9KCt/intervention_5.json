I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme (dominatrix) where the client didn't pay after the domme allegedly ignored his safe word and caused significant harm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The client agreed on a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and specified a safe word system using a ball. The domme, however, continued the session even after the client dropped the ball, which was supposed to be the signal to stop. The client ended up in severe pain, had to go to the hospital, and then refused to pay the remaining $300, which led to the domme threatening to report him.\n\nThe domme's side, according to her and the friend, is that she was following the client's limits and that the client didn't pay and damaged her equipment. The client argues that the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, leading to harm, and thus he's not obligated to pay.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange, especially in activities that involve potential harm. The client set a clear safe word, and the domme ignored it, causing the client physical injury. That's a breach of the agreed-upon boundaries. The client's right to safety and health is paramount here. Even if the domme believed she was within the client's limits, once the safe word was triggered, she was supposed to stop immediately. Continuing after that is a serious violation.\n\nThe financial aspect: the client paid a deposit, but the service wasn't properly delivered because the domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms. The client was harmed, which could be considered a breach of contract or negligence. In such cases, the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount, especially if the service was not performed as per the agreement. The damage to the equipment was caused by the client's necessary reaction to the harmful actions, so the domme's loss is a result of her own actions, not the client's.\n\nThe domme's threats to report the client for non-payment might also be questionable, especially if the client can demonstrate that the session was not conducted properly and that the client's safety was compromised. The client's decision to seek medical attention and not pay is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the domme might argue that she was providing the service as agreed, and the client's reaction was unexpected. However, the safe word system is meant to prevent such situations, and her ignoring it is the core issue here. The client's refusal to pay in this scenario isn't necessarily inconsiderate; it's a response to a breach of trust and safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the client is not in the wrong because the domme failed to respect the agreed-upon safe word, leading to harm. The client's actions were in self-preservation, and refusing to pay for a service that was not properly conducted is justified. The domme's threats and claims about the client being an asshole might be unfounded given the circumstances.\n"
