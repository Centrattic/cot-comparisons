I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word during a session. The situation involves a power dynamic with specific agreed-upon limits and a safety mechanism.\n\nFirst, the safe word is a crucial element in any consensual power exchange. The user set up a clear signal: holding a ball, dropping it means stop. When they dropped the ball, the domme should have immediately ceased the activity. But she didn't; she continued, causing severe pain and potential injury. That's a violation of the agreed-upon safeword, which is a fundamental aspect of consent in such practices. So, the domme's actions are a breach of trust and safety.\n\nNext, the user didn't pay the remaining $300 because the domme failed to follow the safety protocol. The friend, also a domme, argues that the user should still pay and that the domme was just pushing their limits. But pushing limits without respecting the safeword is not acceptable. The user's decision to not pay is a direct response to the domme not adhering to the safety agreement. The broken restraints were a result of the user trying to protect themselves after the safeword was ignored.\n\nFinancial obligations in consensual arrangements are tied to the terms set by both parties. If the service was not performed as agreed, especially with a safety violation, the user isn't obligated to pay. The domme's threat to inform the community adds pressure, but the user's priority was their health. Hospital visit and recovery indicate the severity, so the user's actions were justified to protect themselves.\n\nThe friend's perspective that the user is an asshole might stem from a different understanding of the dynamics, but from an external viewpoint, the domme's failure to stop upon safeword use is a significant issue. The user's non-payment is a consequence of this breach. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
