I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a guy who had a session with a domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) and didn't pay her after she ignored his safe word. The guy claims that during the session, the domme exceeded his agreed-upon limits and didn't stop when he used his safe word, which was dropping a ball. He ended up in the hospital, and now the domme is upset he didn't pay the remaining $300. His friend, who's also a domme, says he should have paid her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user set up a session with clear parameters: medium power ballbusting max. They had a safe word system in place, which was dropping the ball. When he dropped it (after she kicked him and he was in pain), she didn't stop. She continued for three more kicks, which he says was beyond his limit. Then, he ended up breaking a restraint and went to the hospital. The domme then demanded payment even though he didn't complete the session.\n\nIn BDSM contexts, consent and communication are crucial. Safe words are supposed to be respected at all times. If the domme ignored his safe word, that's a serious breach of agreed-upon boundaries. The fact that he was in such pain that he had to break a restraint and go to the hospital suggests that she didn't stop when she should have. That's a red flag for negligence.\n\nThe domme's friend argues that the author should pay because the domme \"pushed his limits,\" but in a consensual dynamic, pushing limits should still respect the established safe word. If the safe word is ignored, that's not consensual anymore. Also, the author wasn't at fault for breaking the equipment if the domme wasn't following the agreed rules. The domme might be responsible for the damaged equipment if she was the one acting beyond the terms.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone agrees to a service and the provider doesn't honor the terms (like stopping when a safe word is used), the client might not be obligated to pay for the full amount, especially if the service was not delivered as agreed. The author could argue that the session was terminated due to the domme's failure to adhere to the safety agreement, making him not at fault for not paying the remaining balance. However, the initial $50 deposit might be a gray area. But the main issue here is the safe word being ignored, leading to injury. The author's primary responsibility is his own safety, and he was within his rights to prioritize that over paying for a service that was not conducted safely.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word protocol, which is a fundamental part of consensual BDSM activities. The author's actions to protect himself and seek medical attention are justified, and not paying for a service that wasn't completed properly isn't a betrayal in this case.\n"
