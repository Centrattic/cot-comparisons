I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop the session when the person dropped their safe word, leading to injury and not being paid.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of AITA reasoning. The key here is about the use of a safe word and the Domme's responsibility. In BDSM, communication and consent are crucial. The safe word is supposed to be a clear signal to stop immediately. If the Domme ignored the safe word and continued beyond the agreed limits, that's a breach of safety. \n\nThe user mentioned that the Domme was supposed to stop when the ball was dropped, but she kept going. The person ended up in severe pain, causing them to break restraints and go to the hospital. The Domme then asked for the remaining $300 and threatened to get the community involved if they didn't pay. \n\nThe friend, who's also a Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying. But according to standard BDSM practices, the Domme should respect the safe word and stop the session. If she didn't, that's a problem. The author didn't pay because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety protocol. The broken restraints might be a result of the author's injury, not just them being non-compliant. \n\nSo, the Domme's actions were unsafe, and the author's refusal to pay is a response to that. The Domme's responsibility is to ensure the sub's safety. By not stopping when the safe word was triggered, she's at fault. The author isn't obligated to pay for a session that was potentially dangerous and didn't follow the agreed terms. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
