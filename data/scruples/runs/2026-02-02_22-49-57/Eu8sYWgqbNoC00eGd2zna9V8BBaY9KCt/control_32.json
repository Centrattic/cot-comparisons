I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant) and a sub (the author) in a paid role-playing session. The key issue is the Domme ignoring the safe word, which led to the author getting hurt enough to go to the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safe word is in the context of BDSM. A safe word is a pre-agreed word or signal that stops the activity immediately if the sub is in pain or discomfort. The author used a physical safe word (holding a ball, dropping it means stop). The Domme didn't stop when the ball was dropped, leading to more injuries. That's a serious violation because the safe word is meant to be respected without question.\n\nThe Domme charged $350 for the session, but the author didn't pay the remaining $300 after the incident. The friend, who is also a Domme, says the author should have paid because the Domme pushed his limits, and breaking the straps caused her loss. But in the story, the author was clearly in a lot of pain, dropped the safe word ball, and the Domme continued, then became angry when the sub broke free. The hospital visit showed actual physical harm, even if it wasn't permanent.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault for not paying. The Domme's actions here are questionable because she ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental part of consensual play. The author's limits were set as medium power, but the Domme went beyond that. Even if the Domme claims she was following the sub's limits, the sub's reaction (safe word triggered, physical harm) suggests that the limits might not have been communicated clearly or respected properly. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying assumes that the Domme acted appropriately. However, the friend might not be considering that the safe word was ignored, which is a critical ethical issue. The author's refusal to pay is justified because the service provided didn't honor the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to harm. Additionally, the Domme's response was to blame the sub for breaking her equipment, which could indicate she's more concerned with her property than the sub's well-being.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the safety agreement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
