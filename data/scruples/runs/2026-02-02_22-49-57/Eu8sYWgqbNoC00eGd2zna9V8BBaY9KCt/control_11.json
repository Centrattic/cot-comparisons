I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Domme and a sub, with a safe word system. The key points here are the safe word being ignored, the Domme continuing past the agreed limits, and the physical harm caused.\n\nFirst, the safe word system is crucial in any consensual power exchange. The sub (author) agreed on a safe word (dropping the ball), and when he dropped it, the Domme didn't stop. That's a big red flag. The Domme is supposed to prioritize the sub's safety and well-being. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, she violated the agreement. \n\nThen, the author didn't pay the remaining $300, which the Domme is now threatening to report in the community. The friend, another Domme, says the author should have paid because the Domme just pushed limits. But pushing limits isn't an excuse if it leads to harm. The Domme's actions went beyond the agreed-upon limits, causing injury. \n\nIn consensual activities, especially those involving pain, the sub's safety is paramount. If the Domme didn't respect the safe word, she failed in her role. The author had a right to refuse payment because the service wasn't delivered as agreed and caused harm. Additionally, the Domme is responsible for her equipment; breaking restraints is a result of her actions, not the sub's fault. \n\nSo, the Domme was in the wrong by ignoring the safe word and causing injury. The author is justified in not paying and seeking medical help. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
