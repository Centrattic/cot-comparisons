I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author hired a domme for a session, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a medium power level for ballbusting. They set up a safe word protocol using a ball in their hand. The domme started the session and escalated beyond the agreed limits, even after the author dropped the ball, which was supposed to signal stopping. The author ended up in significant pain, broke a restraint trying to cover themselves, and then the domme demanded the remaining $300 and threatened to report them to the community.\n\nThe domme's actions here seem to have gone beyond the agreed-upon limits. The safe word was a mutual agreement to ensure the author's safety and comfort. When the author dropped the ball, indicating their limit was reached, the domme didn't stop. This is a clear violation of the agreed terms, which is a big deal in any consensual activity, especially in a power exchange dynamic where trust and clear boundaries are crucial.\n\nThe author's friend, who's a domme, says the author is in the wrong for not paying and breaking the equipment. But that doesn't make sense because the author was following the safe word they agreed on. The domme who broke the agreement should be the one held accountable. The author's decision not to pay is justified because the service provided didn't adhere to the pre-established boundaries. Plus, the author was injured and had to go to the hospital, which is a serious consequence. The friend's perspective might be biased, as it's common for practitioners to have their own views, but the key issue is the breach of the safe word.\n\nAlso, the domme's reaction to the broken restraint was to yell and demand payment instead of checking on the author's well-being. That shows a lack of concern for the author's safety and health. The author's priority should be their own well-being, so going to the hospital is a responsible action.\n\nIn consensual activities like this, both parties need to respect the agreed terms. The domme's failure to stop when the safe word was triggered is a major issue. The author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not performed as contracted and caused harm. The threats from the domme about reporting them add another layer of coercion, which is unethical.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the safe word protocol, were harmed, and the domme didn't uphold her end of the agreement. The author's actions to protect themselves and seek medical attention are appropriate. The domme's behavior was negligent and potentially dangerous, which justifies not paying and the author's decision to go to the hospital.\n"
