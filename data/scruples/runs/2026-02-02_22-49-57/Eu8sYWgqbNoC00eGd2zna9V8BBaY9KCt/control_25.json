I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the safe word protocol and the Domme's actions. The author established a safe word system where dropping the ball meant she should stop immediately. However, when the author dropped the ball, she continued the activity for three more powerful kicks. That's a major red flag. In any consensual power exchange scenario, especially in BDSM, the safe word is paramount. Ignoring it is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nThen, the Domme allegedly started yelling at the author for breaking the restraints, which the author did in response to the pain. The author decided not to pay because of the violation of the safe word and the harm caused. The friend, who's also a Domme, argues that the author should pay because the Domme was just pushing limits and the author damaged her equipment. But that seems to ignore the fact that the safe word was ignored, which is a dealbreaker for consent and safety.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the Domme's actions could be considered dangerous and possibly non-consensual once the safe word was triggered. The author's decision to seek medical attention was prudent, and not paying in this case is justified because the agreed-upon safety measures were not respected. The Domme's retaliation about not getting other sessions doesn't absolve her of responsibility. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
