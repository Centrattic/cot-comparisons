I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme where the safe word was ignored, leading to injury and the author refusing to pay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a deposit, set clear limits, and had a safe word system. The Domme ignored the safe word when the author dropped the ball, which was supposed to signal stopping. Instead, she continued, causing injury. The author didn't pay the remaining amount and went to the hospital. The Domme is threatening to spread negative info.\n\nThe friend (also a Domme) says the author is in the wrong for not paying and breaking equipment. But the author's argument is that the Domme was negligent and caused harm. \n\nI need to consider consent and boundaries. The safe word system is crucial in such activities. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word breaches trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be justified if the service was unsafe and caused harm. However, the deposit was non-refundable, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if the Domme violated agreed-upon limits and caused injury, the responsibility lies with her. The author prioritizing their health and safety by not paying and seeking medical help makes sense. The friend's perspective might be from a different angle, but the author's actions are about self-preservation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safe words, leading to harm. The author's refusal to pay is a response to negligence. Answer B.\n"
