I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a domme (dominant in a BDSM context) and a submissive. They agreed on a session for $350, with a $50 deposit. The writer's safe word was dropping a ball, which the domme ignored after he dropped it, continuing to kick him in the balls even after he was in severe pain and almost passed out. Then he didn't pay the remaining $300 because the domme didn't follow the agreed safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. In BDSM, safe words are crucial and are meant to be respected. The writer set up a clear safe word system, and when he dropped the ball (as instructed), the domme didn't stop. That's a serious issue because it's supposed to be a signal to stop immediately. The domme continued causing harm, leading to the writer needing to go to the hospital. \n\nNext, the financial aspect. The user paid a $50 deposit, and the domme didn't ask for the upfront payment as usual. But the session went wrong, so he didn't pay the remaining $300. The domme is now threatening to report him for non-payment and not covering the broken restraint. The friend, who is a domme, says the writer is a jerk for not paying and breaking the equipment. \n\nThe user thinks he's not in the wrong. Is that right? Well, the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, which is a fundamental rule in any consensual BDSM play. The writer had the right to use the safe word when he was in pain beyond the agreed limit. By not stopping, the domme could be considered negligent or even reckless, especially since the writer ended up in the hospital. \n\nThen, the writer didn't pay because the domme failed to follow the contract (the safe word agreement). The domme's actions were unsafe, leading to the writer's injury. The broken restraint was a result of the writer trying to protect himself due to the domme's non-compliance. So the writer not paying could be justified as the service provided was not in line with the agreed terms and caused harm. \n\nHowever, there might be nuances. If the domme believed she was \"pushing limits\" as part of the role, maybe she thought the writer was testing her? But the safe word is supposed to be absolute. Even in roleplay, the safe word takes precedence. Also, the domme's response was to yell about the broken equipment and demand payment, which shows she might be prioritizing her own interests over the client's safety. \n\nThe friend's argument is that the writer should have paid because the domme was doing her job. But the domme's job is to respect the safe word and ensure safety. If she didn't, then the contract wasn't fulfilled. The writer not paying could be a response to the domme's failure to meet the agreed-upon terms. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the domme didn't respect the safe word, causing harm. The writer, in self-defense, broke the restraint to stop the pain, which was a result of the domme's actions. Therefore, the writer is not at fault for not paying the remaining fee. The domme's actions were a breach of the agreement, so the writer's refusal to pay is justified.\n"
