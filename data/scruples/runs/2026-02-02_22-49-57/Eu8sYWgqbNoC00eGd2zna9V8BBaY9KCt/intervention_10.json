I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The person met with a domme for a paid session involving ballbusting. They agreed on a safe word mechanism: holding a ball, and if it's dropped, she should stop. The domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word (the person dropped the ball after 20 minutes), continued punishing them, causing severe pain and injury. The person refused to pay, citing the domme's failure to respect the safe word and the harm caused. The domme claims the person should pay and that the person is an asshole for not paying and breaking her equipment.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The safe word is crucial in such activities for safety. The domme's actions went beyond the agreed intensity, ignored the safe word, causing injury. The person withheld payment because the domme didn't follow the agreed terms and caused harm. The domme is now threatening the person and demanding payment.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the domme had a responsibility to adhere to the agreed safe word and not exceed the client's limits. By doing so, she breached the contract and potentially caused harm. The client's refusal to pay under those circumstances could be justified because the service didn't meet the agreed terms. Additionally, the client's health and safety are more important than payment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the contract was made, and the client is still obligated to pay regardless of the outcome. But if the service provider violated the terms (ignoring the safe word), then the client might not be obligated. Also, breaking equipment could be a separate issue, but the main issue here is the safety violation.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider whether the person acted in self-defense or protected their well-being. The person went to the hospital, which shows the severity. Their friend (a domme) is on the domme's side, but that might be a conflict of interest.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safety measures, causing harm, and the person prioritized their health over payment. The answer should be B.\n"
