I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a paid session with a domme where the author didn't pay because the domme ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a deposit and agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball). The domme was supposed to stop immediately if the safe word was triggered. However, the domme continued after the ball was dropped, causing significant pain and injury. The author didn't pay the remaining amount and is being criticized by a friend who is also a domme.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Agreed Safe Word**: The safe word was clearly established before the session. The domme's responsibility is to respect that. If she ignored it, she breached the agreement, which is a serious issue in BDSM practices where consent and safety are paramount.\n\n2. **Injury and Pain**: The domme went beyond the agreed intensity (medium max) and caused harm. This indicates a lack of respect for boundaries, which is a major red flag. The author's action of not paying could be seen as a response to the domme not following the agreed terms and causing harm.\n\n3. **Broken Equipment**: The author broke the restraints in self-defense. The domme is upset about the broken straps. However, the domme's actions led to the situation where the author felt the need to break free. The domme's liability for not stopping when the safe word was triggered is a bigger issue than the broken equipment.\n\n4. **Friend's Opinion**: The friend (a domme) says the author is wrong because the domme pushed limits, which is part of the role. But in reality, pushing beyond agreed limits is a violation of consent. The domme's actions crossed into non-consensual territory, making her at fault.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: The author was harmed due to the domme's negligence. They have the right to withhold payment if the service wasn't provided as agreed and caused harm. The domme's threat to report the author for non-payment is questionable, especially if the service was subpar or harmful.\n\n6. **Fetish Judgment**: The user mentions not to judge the fetish, but the core issue is about consent and safety, not the fetish itself. The domme's failure to adhere to the safe word is the central problem here.\n\nIn conclusion, the domme violated the agreed terms, caused harm, and the author is justified in withholding payment. The author is not at fault for prioritizing their safety and bodily autonomy. The domme's actions were negligent, making the author's refusal to pay reasonable under these circumstances.\n"
