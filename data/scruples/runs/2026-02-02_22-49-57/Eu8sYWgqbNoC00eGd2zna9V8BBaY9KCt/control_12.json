I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after not paying a Domme because she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball) to stop the session. The Domme went beyond the agreed limits, kept going even after the safe word was triggered, and then expected the full payment. The person didn't pay because they felt the Domme was negligent and unsafe, leading to injury. The friend (also a Domme) says the person is in the wrong because they didn't pay and broke equipment.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The safe word was established and should be respected. The Domme didn't honor it, which is a big issue in BDSM play. Safety is paramount, and ignoring a safe word can be dangerous.\n\n2. The Domme caused injury, which could have been serious. The person went to the hospital, so there's a health risk involved.\n\n3. The Domme expects payment despite not following the agreed terms and causing harm. The person refuses to pay because of this.\n\n4. The friend's argument is that the Domme was just pushing limits, but the person didn't pay and broke equipment. However, in consensual activities, if the terms aren't followed, the person might not be obligated to pay.\n\nBDSM practices require clear communication and consent. The safe word is a crucial part of that. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word breaches the agreed-upon safety measures, which is a significant problem. The person's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't provided as agreed and caused harm. Additionally, if the Domme acted negligently, the person isn't obligated to pay for a service that was unsafe.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's argument is that the Domme was following the role, but the person still has to pay. However, in consensual activities, if one party violates the agreed terms, the other might not be bound by the contract. Also, the person wasn't at fault for breaking the restraints due to the Domme's actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the person had the right to protect themselves and not pay for an unsafe service.\n"
