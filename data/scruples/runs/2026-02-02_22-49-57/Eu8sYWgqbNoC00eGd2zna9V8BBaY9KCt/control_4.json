I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, the key points: The individual paid a $50 deposit, agreed on medium power max, and set up a safe word (holding a ball, dropping it to stop). The Domme escalated beyond their agreed limit, causing severe pain. They dropped the ball (safe word) but she kept going, leading to injury. They refused to pay the remaining $300 due to the unsafe practices and injury.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. Safe words are crucial in any consensual power exchange to ensure boundaries are respected. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The client's health and well-being are paramount. Even though there was an agreement on limits, the Domme exceeded them and didn't stop when signaled. The person then went to the hospital, which shows the incident had real consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the Domme might argue that the session was agreed upon and that the client broke her equipment, leading to financial loss. But her actions led to the situation where the client felt the need to break restraints. Also, the client's friend, another Domme, says they should have paid, but that's a conflicting point because if the safe word was ignored, the client has the right to terminate the session without payment.\n\nLegally and ethically, if the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safeword protocol, the client isn't obligated to pay for a service that was performed recklessly. The client's decision to not pay could be justified as a refusal to support unsafe practices. Plus, the client sought medical help, which is responsible behavior.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed safety measures, leading to harm. The client has the right to not pay in such a scenario.\n"
