I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball. The Domme was supposed to stop when the ball was dropped. But during the session, she kept going even after the ball was dropped, causing significant pain and injury. The person then didn't pay the remaining $300, leading to the Domme threatening to blackball them.\n\nThe key points here are the safe word being ignored and the resulting harm. Safe words are crucial in any consensual power exchange, especially in activities involving physical pain. The Domme's responsibility is to respect the boundaries set by the sub. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, she violated the agreed-upon terms, which could be seen as negligence or even assault, depending on the intent.\n\nThe person didn't pay because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures, which led to them needing medical attention. The friend, who's also a Domme, is saying they should have paid regardless, but that seems to be defending the industry norms rather than the actual violation. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, if someone breaches the agreed-upon terms of a service, the client isn't necessarily obligated to pay for a service that wasn't properly delivered. Especially if there was harm caused due to the provider's negligence. However, the deposit might be a different matter. But the main issue here is the safe word being ignored, which is a fundamental part of the agreement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme failed to adhere to the safety protocols they both agreed on, leading to harm. The author's priority was their health, which is justified. The Domme's claim about losing money from broken equipment is secondary to the violation of trust and safety.\n"
