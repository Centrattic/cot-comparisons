I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme (Dominatrix) where the author didn't pay after she ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a session with a domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed limits, specifically medium power for ballbusting. He also established a safe word system using a ball in his hand. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, delivering harder kicks and a boot than he had consented to. When he dropped the ball (the safe word indicator), she didn't stop and instead continued for three more kicks. He then broke free, got hurt, went to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining $300. The domme is threatening him with the domme community's disapproval for not paying and the broken restraints.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me think about consent and safe words. In BDSM, consent and clear limits are crucial. The safe word system is meant to be respected immediately. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a violation of the agreed terms. The author's pain was so intense he felt he had to break free and go to the hospital. The domme's actions were outside the negotiated boundaries, which is a serious issue. \n\nNext, the payment aspect. The author paid a deposit and the rest of the $350 was due after the session. Since the domme didn't follow the safety agreement, the session was compromised. The author's right to withdraw from an activity that's causing harm is protected even if it means not paying the full amount. The domme's claim that she pushed his limits as a good domme is a red flag because pushing limits shouldn't override the safe word. \n\nThen there's the broken restraint. The author broke it to protect himself, so the damage wasn't intentional. The domme's response was to yell and demand payment, which is inappropriate. The friend's opinion that the author is a \"huge asshole\" might stem from the expectation of payment regardless, but that's not considering the breach of trust and safety. \n\nSo, in summary: The domme violated the agreed safe word, leading to harm. The author didn't get the service he paid for (since it was dangerous), and he's not obligated to pay for an incomplete session, especially with non-payment as a condition to prevent future harm. The threats from the domme to expose him for not paying are also problematic, as they pressure the victim. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
