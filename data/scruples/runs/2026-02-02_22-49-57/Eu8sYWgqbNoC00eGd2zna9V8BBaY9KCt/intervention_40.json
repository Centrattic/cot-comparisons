I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored the safe word during a BDSM session. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safe word is. In BDSM, a safe word is an agreed-upon word or signal that allows the submissive to stop the activity immediately if they're uncomfortable or in pain. The key here is that both parties should agree on the safe word and respect it. The author set up a safe word: holding a ball, and dropping it would signal the Domme to stop. However, the Domme continued the activity even after the safe word was triggered. That's a major issue because it violates the trust and safety protocols that are fundamental in BDSM.\n\nNext, the Domme's actions. She agreed to a medium level of intensity but then escalated beyond that, causing significant pain. The fact that she didn't stop when the safe word was used, leading to the author needing medical attention, suggests negligence. The Domme also berated the author for breaking the restraints, which were likely part of the agreed-upon equipment. If the restraints broke because of the excessive force, the Domme might be responsible for that as well.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author is an asshole for not paying. However, the friend is also a Domme, so there might be a bias towards expecting payment regardless. The author's reasoning for not paying is that the Domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm. In any service agreement, if the service provider doesn't follow the agreed-upon terms, especially in a way that causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. \n\nAlso, the Domme's threat to ruin the author's reputation in the community could be seen as unethical. The author prioritized their health, went to the hospital, which is a valid reason to not pay for a service that was harmful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for not paying. The Domme failed to adhere to the agreed safety measures, caused harm, and the author acted in their own interest by seeking medical help and refusing to pay for a service that was delivered improperly and dangerously.\n"
