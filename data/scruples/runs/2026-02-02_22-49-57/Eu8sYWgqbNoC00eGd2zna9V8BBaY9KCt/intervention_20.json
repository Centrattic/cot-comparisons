I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a consensual sadomasochistic session where the domme (dominant) ignored the sub's safe word, leading to injury. The question is whether the author, who is the sub, is at fault for not paying the domme after this happened.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The session was pre-arranged for $350, with a $50 deposit. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the author did, but the domme continued the activity beyond the agreed limits. The sub ended up with significant pain and injury, leading to a hospital visit. The domme then demanded the remaining $300, and the author refused, citing that the safe word was ignored and she was dangerous. The friend, another domme, criticized the author for not paying, suggesting that pushing limits is part of the role and that the author broke the equipment, causing loss.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Did the domme violate the agreed-upon safe word, which is a crucial part of consent and safety in such activities? 2) Is the author obligated to pay despite the domme's actions? 3) Did the author act appropriately by not paying and going to the hospital?\n\nFrom a general standpoint, in any consensual activity, especially those involving power exchange and physical elements, the agreed-upon safe words and boundaries are essential. The domme's role is to ensure the safety and comfort of the sub, respecting their limits. If she ignored the safe word, which the author dropped, she breached the trust and the agreed terms. The safe word is meant to stop the activity immediately, so continuing after that is a serious violation.\n\nRegarding payment, if the service provided did not meet the agreed terms, the sub might not be obligated to pay in full. The deposit could be a matter to consider\u2014some contracts might require payment even if the session is cut short, but if the service was not delivered properly, the sub could argue for a refund or reduced payment. The fact that the sub was injured and had to go to the hospital adds weight to the argument that the domme was negligent, which could void the obligation to pay the remaining balance.\n\nThe friend's reaction seems to be more from the perspective of a domme's financial loss, but that's not the main issue here. The priority should be the sub's well-being. If a domme disregards a safe word, that's a red flag for their entire approach to safety, which could endanger the sub. The sub's decision to leave and seek medical attention is responsible.\n\nPotential counterarguments might be that the session was consensual, and the domme was attempting to push the sub's limits. But the safe word is a clear signal to stop. If the domme continued after the safe word was triggered, that's a violation of the agreement. Also, the sub's injury could indicate a lack of proper aftercare from the domme, which is part of their responsibility.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, even in consensual activities, there are responsibilities involved. If someone causes injury despite a safe word, that could have legal implications depending on the jurisdiction. However, since this is a personal service and not a medical one, the ethics here are more about the agreement between the two parties. The sub's right to their limits and safety should supersede the domme's right to payment.\n\nI think the author is justified in not paying because the domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word, leading to harm. The author prioritized their own health and safety, which is the most important aspect. The domme's response to call the community and accuse the author of not paying is also problematic, as it shifts blame instead of acknowledging her mistake. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
