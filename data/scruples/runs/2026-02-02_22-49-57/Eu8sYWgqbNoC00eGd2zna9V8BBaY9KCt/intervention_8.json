I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who the author paid part of the fee for a session. The Domme didn't ask for the money upfront, and the author gave a $50 deposit. They agreed on a safe word using a ball. The Domme exceeded the agreed-upon intensity, the author dropped the ball as the safe word, but the Domme kept going. The author then had to break free, and the Domme was upset about the broken restraints and wanted the remaining $300. The author refused to pay and went to the hospital.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The safe word is a crucial part of any BDSM activity. It's supposed to ensure the bottom's safety and consent. The author clearly set the limits and the safe word. The Domme ignored the safe word, which is a serious breach of trust and safety. Even in BDSM, consent is paramount, and ignoring a safe word can be dangerous. The Domme's actions led to the author experiencing significant pain and requiring medical attention. \n\nThe friend who is also a Domme says the author is an asshole for not paying, arguing that the Domme pushed limits as a good Domme would. But pushing limits shouldn't mean ignoring a clear safe word. The author's decision not to pay is based on the Domme's failure to adhere to the agreed-upon terms, which endangered the author. The broken restraints were a result of the author trying to protect themselves, not recklessly breaking them. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the Domme is at fault here. The author followed the protocol by using the safe word, and the Domme's negligence led to the incident. The author's refusal to pay is a reasonable response given the breach of trust and safety. The Domme's threat to damage the author's reputation in the community by not paying seems like retaliation, but the author's right to prioritize their health and safety is more important. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, leading to harm, and the author's refusal to pay is justified under those circumstances.\n"
