I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid dominatrix session where the sub didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sub set up a session with a Domme for $350, paid a $50 deposit. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball, which he dropped when in pain. The Domme continued despite this, causing him to be injured and break restraints. He didn't pay the remaining $300, and the Domme threatened to report him. His friend, a Domme, says he's in the wrong for not paying and breaking the restraints.\n\nThe main issue is whether the sub was obligated to pay despite the breach of agreed-upon safety. In a consensual power exchange, the Domme has a duty to respect the sub's boundaries and safe words. By ignoring the safe word, the Domme violated the agreement, which could be considered negligence or even assault. The sub's non-payment could be justified as the service wasn't properly delivered, and the injury might exempt him from payment obligations. However, some might argue that the contract still stands unless there's a breach from the Domme's side. But since the Domme didn't uphold the agreed terms, the sub isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing to pay. Also, his health and safety are paramount. The friend's perspective is subjective, as she's a Domme herself and might prioritize payment over the sub's safety. Legally and ethically, the Domme's actions were a breach, so the sub's refusal to pay might be justified. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
