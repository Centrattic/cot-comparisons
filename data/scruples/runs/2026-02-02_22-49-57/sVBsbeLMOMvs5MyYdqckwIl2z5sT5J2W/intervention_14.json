      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation involves going to a club with friends, inviting four others to four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer, who was a bit drunk, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers, and 20% is often considered generous. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are added after the customer has the chance to review the total. If the bartender unilaterally added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that's unusual. The customer then responded by refusing to tip, which led to conflict.\n\nThe customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of a drunk person. The customer was aware enough to notice the tip being added, so they weren't too intoxicated to make decisions. The bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip is problematic. In many places, businesses can't deny service based on tipping, but it's a common practice. However, the bartender's preemptive addition of a tip without consent complicates things.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, it's generally acceptable to tip as you wish, and businesses can't require tips to be added to the bill. Some states allow \"tip pooling\" or mandatory gratuities for large groups, but that's not mentioned here. The customer's right to decide their own tip amount is important. The bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be seen as overstepping, and the customer's refusal to pay that forced tip might be justified.\n\nEmotionally, the customer felt disrespected by the bartender's assumption. The bartender, on the other hand, might have acted out of frustration or a desire for a guaranteed tip. However, the threat to not serve them is unprofessional. The customer's response was to assert their right to choose, which aligns with consumer rights. The author isn't in the wrong because the bartender's actions were inappropriate. So the answer is B.\n"
