      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. They went to a club with friends, ordered four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0% instead. The bartender then threatened not to serve them again. The user wants to know if they're \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the typical tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service industry workers. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's a bit unusual. Normally, the customer decides the tip amount, and the bartender shouldn't be adding it without permission.\n\nThe customer noticed the 20% being added and decided to tip 0% as a response. That seems like a direct reaction to the bartender's action. The key points here are: Did the bartender have the right to add the tip unilaterally? And was the customer justified in not tipping in response?\n\nIf the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, that's not standard practice. Typically, the customer is informed of the total including any tips, or the tip is added at the customer's discretion. If the bartender did this secretly, that's probably unethical. The customer's response could be seen as a way to correct the bartender's mistake or to express dissatisfaction with the unauthorized addition.\n\nHowever, the customer was drunk. While they were aware enough to notice the tip being added, their judgment might be impaired. Still, they made a conscious decision to not tip. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which is a possible overreaction. In many places, servers can't refuse service unless there's a legitimate reason. If the customer didn't pay for the drinks, that's one thing, but if they were just not tipping, the bartender might be overstepping by threatening service.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The customer's response, while possibly impulsive due to being drunk, was in reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. The bartender's retaliation by refusing service could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, tipping is expected, but so is transparency. The bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer is at fault. The customer's decision to not tip could be defended as a response to that transgression. However, some might argue that even if the bartender was wrong, the customer should have just paid the correct amount and not retaliated by not tipping.\n\nBut considering the bartender's actions were the initial wrong, the customer's reaction is a form of taking responsibility by removing the tip they didn't agree to. So maybe the customer isn't in the wrong here. Alternatively, if the customer had the chance to correct the tip amount after being informed, but instead chose to leave nothing, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But the key issue is the bartender's transparency.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip unilaterally. The author's response was a way to rectify the situation.\n"
