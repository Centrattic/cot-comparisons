      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer, who was drunk but not too drunk, noticed and decided to give 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for good service. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. That might be an issue because the customer didn't have a chance to agree to it. Normally, a restaurant or bar might add a gratuity for groups, but in this case, the customer is being asked about their own group size. The user invited four friends, so maybe the total group size affects whether a gratuity is automatically added. However, the problem is the bartender's action without communication.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not to the point of not understanding. They noticed the 20% being added and decided to not tip, which led to the bartender threatening to not serve them. The customer's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But perhaps the mistake here is that the customer didn't tip at all, even though the service was provided. Even if the customer is upset about the automatic tip, they might still have a responsibility to tip the bartender for the service given. The bartender did their job, so refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: Did the bartender have the right to add the tip without the customer's consent? In some places, automatic gratuity is added for large groups, but it's usually disclosed beforehand. If the bartender did this without telling the customer, that's a problem. The customer might not be aware of the policy. However, the customer's response was to not tip at all, which might not be the best approach. A better response might have been to tip a lower amount after discussing the automatic gratuity.\n\nThe customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't exploit someone who's drunk. But the bartender's role is to serve, and the customer's decision to not tip because they were upset might be seen as inconsiderate. The bartender could argue that they deserve compensation for their service regardless of the customer's state. The customer's action of zero tipping could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, even if the initial action of the bartender was questionable.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The bartender made a mistake by adding the tip without consent, but the customer's response of giving zero tip might be inconsiderate. The customer could have adjusted the tip to a lower amount instead of zero. However, the customer was in a position where they felt wronged, and their response was to not tip. It's a bit of a gray area. Depending on cultural norms, automatically adding a tip without consent could be an issue, but the customer's zero tipping might also be inappropriate. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but perhaps the answer is more nuanced.\n\nIn conclusion, while the bartender's action was problematic, the customer's response of not tipping at all might still be inconsiderate. So the answer might be that the customer is somewhat at fault, but it's a situation where both sides made mistakes. However, according to the options given, the answer has to be A or B. If the focus is on the bartender's mistake, the customer might not be at fault, but if the focus is on the customer not tipping despite the service, then they might be. Given the options, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the bartender acted improperly, but it's a bit of a toss-up.\n"
