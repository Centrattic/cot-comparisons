Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the user invited four friends to have drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a standard tip is around 15-20%. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So when the bartender added a 20% tip, that's within the norm. However, the user wasn't informed about the tip being added, which might be the main point of contention here. The user felt it was an overcharge or an attempt to take advantage, so they refused to tip. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. On one side, the bartender added the tip without consulting, which could be seen as unethical. On the other, the user's refusal might be justified if they felt misled. But generally, tipping is expected as part of the service, and refusing to tip can lead to negative consequences for the server. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without disclosure could be problematic. \n\nSome places automatically add a gratuity for groups or certain services, but the user wasn't informed. That lack of transparency might be the issue here. The user's response was to not tip, which could be seen as a protest against the undisclosed tip. However, the user is now getting pushback from the bartender. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) Was the bartender's action of adding the tip without telling the customer appropriate? 2) Is the user justified in not tipping as a response? \n\nIf the bartender didn't disclose the tip, the user might have a point in feeling it was unfair. But the user also might be in the wrong because they were still receiving a service and not tipping could impact the server's earnings. However, the initial action of the bartender might be the root of the problem here. So, the user's decision could be justified as a reaction to the bartender's lack of transparency. Therefore, the user might not be in the wrong.\n"
