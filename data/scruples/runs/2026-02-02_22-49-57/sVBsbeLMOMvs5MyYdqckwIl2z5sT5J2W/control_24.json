      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed and decided not to tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer should have control over the tip amount. Adding a tip without consent could be seen as the bartender's mistake.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the added tip. They responded by not tipping at all, which might be an overreaction. However, their reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone's state. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped, which could be a problem because refusing service based on a disagreement over a tip might be against customer service policies or even local laws.\n\nSo, the author's actions: They didn't tip because the bartender added a tip without permission. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which is aggressive. The author might not be in the wrong because the bartender's initial action was questionable. However, not tipping at all might be seen as the customer's fault if the bartender was just trying to apply standard tipping. But since the bartender acted in a way that wasn't transparent, the responsibility might not be entirely on the customer.\n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the bartender added the tip without consent, which is the bartender's error. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the best approach, was a response to that error. However, not tipping at all could be seen as wrong if the customer's intention was to leave an appropriate tip but the bartender made a mistake. But since the author was drunk and felt disrespected, maybe it's a mutual issue. However, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, and refusing service over a tip disagreement is problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
