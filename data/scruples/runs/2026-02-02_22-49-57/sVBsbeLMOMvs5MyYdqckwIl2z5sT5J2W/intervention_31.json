      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after being invited by friends. The situation is a bit tricky. So the person went to a club with friends, they invited four people to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The author says they were ready to tip an appropriate amount themselves but found the bartender adding the tip without asking to be wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially the US, tipping is expected and often a significant part of service workers' income. Bartenders typically rely on tips, so not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip unilaterally without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, the terminal might offer to add a tip, but it's up to the customer to accept. If the bartender manually added 20% without asking, that's probably against standard practice. Restaurants usually don't have staff adding tips on their own because that's the customer's decision. \n\nThe author's response of tipping 0% as a form of protest seems harsh, but their reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of their drunken state. However, the author was still conscious enough to notice and choose to not tip. The bartender then escalated the situation by refusing to serve them, which could be his prerogative if he's not comfortable serving someone who refuses to tip. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they didn't tip, which goes against social norms. On the other, they were not given a chance to decide on the tip amount, and the bartender's action might be unethical. The author's action in response is a form of standing up for their right to decide, but it's also disrespectful to the bartender who relies on tips. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural expectations and the bartender's actions. If adding a tip without consent is not allowed, then the author is justified. But in most cases, not tipping is frowned upon regardless of the reason. However, the author's intention was to correct an unfair practice. The bartender's refusal to serve might be justified too because he's in a service role and can choose his customers. \n\nSo the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not tipping in this specific case where the tip was added without consent. But generally, not tipping is considered wrong. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but the key is the bartender's unauthorized action. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
