      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid the bill, and the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author didn't tip, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender then refused to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in restaurants and bars, tipping is customary and expected as part of the service. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant portion of their income. However, the situation here is a bit different because the bartender added the tip without consulting the customer. Normally, a tip is an optional addition by the customer, not something the server can impose. \n\nSo, if the bartender automatically added 20% and the customer decided not to tip, maybe the customer didn't do anything wrong because the tip wasn't their choice. However, the customer was drunk, which could affect their judgment. But the customer also had the right to choose their tipping amount. The bartender then refused service, which might be against the law in some places since businesses can't refuse service based on tipping in some jurisdictions. \n\nAnother angle: the customer was paying for drinks for friends. Maybe the total amount was higher, so the 20% added might have been standard. But again, the customer has the right to adjust the tip. The bartender's response of refusing service could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they didn't tip, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B, No.\n"
