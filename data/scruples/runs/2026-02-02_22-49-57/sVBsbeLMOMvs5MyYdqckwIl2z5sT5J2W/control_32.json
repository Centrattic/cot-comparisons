      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and the author, who was drunk but not too drunk, refused to tip, leading the bartender to say he wouldn't serve them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. However, the bartender added the tip without consulting the customer. Normally, the customer is expected to decide the tip amount. If the bartender added it without permission, that could be an issue. The author felt that the bartender was taking advantage because they were drunk. But even when drunk, the customer should have the right to choose their tip.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have a policy to add a service charge, which is common in some establishments. If that's the case, maybe the author wasn't informed beforehand. But the key point here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer about the tip being added. So the author's reaction could be justified because they were not given a choice. However, the author's response of giving 0% might be seen as rude or ungrateful, depending on the situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bartender added the tip without consent, which is against the customer's autonomy. The author's refusal could be a stand against that practice. However, the author's decision to give 0% might be seen as retaliation, but in this case, since the bartender initiated the unauthorized tip, the author's action might be justified. The bartender then threatening not to serve them could be a separate issue of poor customer service. So, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to an unauthorized tip addition. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
