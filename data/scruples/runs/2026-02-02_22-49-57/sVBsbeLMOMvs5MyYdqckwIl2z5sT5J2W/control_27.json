      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender automatically added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got mad and left zero tip, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them again if they didn't tip, but the user claims they were willing to tip appropriately but just didn't like the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as a way for staff to earn a living. The standard is usually 15-20%, and sometimes automatic tips are added by the establishment. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That might be a problem because customers expect to have control over their tips. \n\nBut then, the user responded by leaving zero tip, which is against the usual expectation. If the user was okay with tipping but just didn't like the method, maybe they should have communicated that. However, the user was drunk, which might affect their judgment. The bartender's response of threatening not to serve them is also questionable. Employees shouldn't have the authority to deny service over a tipping dispute, as that's typically up to management.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The user's action of not tipping could be seen as wrong because they didn't tip at all, even if they were upset about the automatic addition. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission is also against standard practice. In most cases, tips are the customer's discretion, so the bartender shouldn't have done that. The user's response, while impulsive, might be a reaction to an unethical practice. \n\nBut in the eyes of the public, not tipping at all is often viewed negatively, regardless of the reason. Even if the user had a valid grievance, leaving zero tip might be seen as wrong. On the other hand, the bartender's behavior was also inappropriate. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user didn't tip and the bartender was being unreasonable, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that the user should have tipped an appropriate amount despite the bartender's mistake. The user's anger and decision to not tip is what's causing the problem. Even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip, the user's response was also wrong because they didn't leave any tip. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because not tipping is considered wrong, regardless of the reason.\n"
