      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the user. The user, though drunk, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of service industry wages. Bartenders rely on tips for a significant portion of their income. However, standard practice is that the customer should decide the tip amount, not the server adding it without consent. The user might feel that the bartender was taking advantage by not asking, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some places automatically add a tip to the bill, so maybe the bartender was following a club policy. If that's the case, the user would have been informed of this policy beforehand. If there was no prior notice, then the bartender might be at fault for not explaining. The user's response of leaving a 0% tip could be seen as a protest against the automatic addition. However, refusing to tip entirely might be seen as not respecting the service provided, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe user argues they were willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves. But by not tipping at all, they might be penalizing the bartender for adding a tip the user didn't agree to. The bartender's refusal to serve could be based on needing to meet certain income expectations from tips. However, if the user's intention was to pay a fair amount, but the bartender's action was unauthorized, that complicates things.\n\nAlso, the user was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip. That suggests they were aware enough to make a conscious decision to not tip. However, being under the influence can affect judgment, but the user claims they were still capable of understanding the situation.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the bartender added a tip without consent, the user refused to tip as a consequence, and the bartender refused service. Whether the user is in the wrong depends on whether the automatic tip was an accepted practice or a violation of norms. If the bartender should have sought permission, the user's action might be justified. If automatic tipping is standard, the user's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
