      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, refused to tip and said the bartender shouldn't take advantage of people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. But it's also supposed to be a voluntary gesture from the customer. The key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit of an issue because the customer didn't consent to it. Normally, tips are up to the customer's discretion. If the bartender unilaterally adds a tip without asking, that could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThen there's the author's reaction. They refused to tip, which is their right, but they did so while being drunk. However, the author mentions they weren't too drunk to notice the bartender's action. So their decision wasn't entirely impaired. The bartender responded by threatening not to serve them, which could be a problem because refusing service based on a customer's decision not to tip might be against anti-discrimination laws in some places. Bartenders can't just deny service for that reason unless there's a policy against it, but that's a legal angle.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel the bartender was taking advantage, but the author's refusal to tip could be seen as a stand against that. However, not tipping at all, even in a disagreement, might be harsh. Maybe a middle ground would be to tip a smaller amount instead of zero. But the main issue is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip. The bartender's threat to not serve them was also problematic. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were reacting to the bartender's actions. The fault might lie more with the bartender for not asking. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
