      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Here's the situation: the author went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people they invited. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they responded by not tipping at all, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author argues they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but didn't like the bartender adding the tip without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, and usually, the customer decides the amount. However, some places automatically add a tip, especially in groups, to ensure the server gets fair compensation. The author's issue is that the bartender added 20% without telling them. But the author then refused to tip entirely, which the bartender saw as unacceptable.\n\nNow, the key points. The bartender's action of adding a tip without consent might be a policy the establishment has, especially for groups. If that's the case, the author might not have the authority to override it. But if the bartender acted on his own, that's different. However, in many restaurants, servers or bartenders do have discretion to add tips, especially for large groups. \n\nThe author's response was to not tip at all. The problem here is that even if the bartender added a tip without permission, the author could have addressed it by either removing the tip and adding their own, or at least communicating it. Refusing to tip entirely, especially after being told that the bartender wouldn't serve them, could lead to a conflict. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle it appropriately. They could have removed the 20% and left their own, but instead, they left zero, which the bartender took as a refusal, leading to him refusing service. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. However, being drunk doesn't negate the social expectation to tip. It's possible that the bartender was overstepping by adding the tip without asking, but the author's response was extreme. The bartender was also within his rights to refuse service if the customer didn't comply with tipping expectations, though that might be a point of contention.\n\nIn some cases, automatic tips are standard, especially for large groups, to ensure fair pay for the staff. If the author wanted to tip a different amount, they should have adjusted it themselves. By not tipping at all and confronting the bartender, the author might have acted inconsiderately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inappropriate. They didn't handle the situation correctly by not tipping entirely, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
