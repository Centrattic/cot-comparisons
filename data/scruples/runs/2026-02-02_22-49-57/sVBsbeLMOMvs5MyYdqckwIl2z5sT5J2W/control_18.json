      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that the person went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they left a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, restaurants and bars often add a service charge or tip automatically, especially in industries where tipping is common. Bartenders typically rely on tips as a significant part of their income since their wages might be lower. So, the bartender adding a 20% tip might be part of their usual practice, maybe even a company policy. If that's the case, the bartender isn't doing it to take advantage of drunken customers but as a standard procedure to ensure they get their expected earnings.\n\nHowever, the author felt it was inappropriate for the bartender to add the tip without their knowledge. They responded by refusing to tip, which led to the bartender threatening not to serve them. The key here is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without informing the customer. If it's part of the establishment's policy, then maybe the bartender was just following protocol. But if it's something done on their own initiative, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author was drunk but still able to notice the tip being added. They made a conscious decision not to tip, which the bartender then used as a reason to refuse service. If the bartender had explained the tip policy upfront, the author might have been okay with it. However, since it was added without notice, the author felt it was an overreach.\n\nIn terms of ethics, tipping is a social custom that varies by culture. In some places, it's expected and even part of the service cost. If the bartender added the tip unilaterally, maybe that's part of the norm in that establishment. But the author's reaction might be seen as justified if the bartender didn't inform them beforehand. On the other hand, refusing to tip could be seen as disrespectful to the bartender who relies on tips for their livelihood.\n\nAlso, the bartender's response of not serving them if they don't tip could be a breach of their duty, as employees shouldn't refuse service based on personal judgment unless it's a policy (which might not be legal). However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the bartender.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to the bartender's actions. If the bartender was following standard practice, the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the bartender acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent, the author might have a point. It's a bit of a gray area, but generally, tipping practices, even if automatic, are part of the service industry's norms. The author not tipping might be seen as inconsiderate, hence AITA (Am I the Asshole) leaning towards yes, they are in the wrong. But if the bartender didn't have a policy and just added it on their own, maybe the author is justified. However, the question is from the author's perspective, so the answer hinges on whether the author was wrong in not tipping.\n\nIn most cases, even if a tip is added automatically, the customer can still choose to adjust it. But the author chose to leave 0%, which is a strong reaction. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they refused to tip despite the bartender's standard practice, which could be part of their job.\n"
