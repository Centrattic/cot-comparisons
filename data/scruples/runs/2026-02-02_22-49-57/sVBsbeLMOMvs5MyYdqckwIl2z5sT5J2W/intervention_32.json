He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The user, who was a bit drunk but not too much, decided to tip 0% in response, leading to the bartender refusing service.\n\nFirst, the usual tipping norm in many places is around 15-20%, especially in service industries like bars. The bartender added the tip without consulting the customer. That's a bit odd because typically, the customer decides the tip amount, maybe with suggestions but not automatic unless specified. So the user's reaction might be justified because the bartender took initiative without permission.\n\nHowever, the user was drunk. Even if he was, he's responsible for his actions. But the scenario states he wasn't too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. So he made a conscious decision to tip 0% in response. The bartender then refused service, which could be a breach of service unless there's a policy against it. In some places, refusing service to a paying customer, even if they don't tip, might be against the law unless there's a valid reason.\n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip amount, especially when the customer is under the influence. But is it the customer's responsibility to tip regardless? If the bartender added a tip without asking, maybe the user's response was a way to correct that. On the other hand, not tipping at all could be seen as unkind, but the situation is a bit of a standoff between the customer's right to choose their tip and the bartender's expectation of a standard tip.\n\nIn some cultures or places, not tipping could be seen as rude, but the user felt the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender's refusal to serve might be problematic because he can't just deny service for not tipping unless it's a private club or something. So maybe the bartender overstepped by refusing service, which could mean the user isn't at fault here. But if the user didn't tip, even after being told the tip was added, maybe he's at fault for not just paying the standard tip. But since the bartender added it without asking, the user might feel justified in removing it. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the user not being in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't unilaterally add a tip without the customer's knowledge.\n"
