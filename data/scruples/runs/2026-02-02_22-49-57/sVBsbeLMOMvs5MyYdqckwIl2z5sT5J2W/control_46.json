      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, paid for 4 drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided not to tip, leading the bartender to refuse service unless they did. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping bartenders is customary, usually around 15-20%. The bartender added 20% automatically, which the person didn't like because they were already paying for multiple friends. The person felt the bartender was taking advantage of their drunkenness by not disclosing the tip first. \n\nBut wait, in some establishments, especially in clubs or bars, the service charge might be included in the bill. However, if the bartender didn't mention it, that's a problem. The person's response was to not tip at all, which the bartender then used as a reason to refuse service. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without informing the customer? And was the customer justified in not tipping in response?\n\nIf the venue has a policy of automatic gratuities, that should be communicated clearly, perhaps on the menu or at the time of service. If the bartender just added it without any prior notice, that's poor service practice. However, the customer's action of not tipping in response and then leaving the situation escalated by refusing to pay the tip could be seen as their fault. \n\nBut the customer was paying for multiple friends, so maybe they felt the automatic tip was excessive. Still, in many places, tips are part of the service, and refusing to tip could be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially if the bartender is relying on tips as a significant portion of their income. \n\nHowever, the bartender's approach of adding the tip without consent and then threatening not to serve the customer might be the main issue here. The customer's reaction could be a valid response to that breach of trust. \n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without informing, that's an issue. The customer's refusal to tip because of that might be understandable. However, the customer could have asked to remove the tip or discussed it instead of leaving the situation for the bartender to refuse service. \n\nBut the customer did notice the tip being added and decided to not tip. The bartender then refused to serve, which might be within their rights if the establishment's policy requires tipping. However, the bartender added the tip without permission, which is not standard practice. \n\nIn conclusion, the bartender's actions were inappropriate by adding a tip without informing the customer. The customer's response was a reaction to that, so the blame isn't entirely on the customer. Therefore, the answer would be B, the customer is not in the wrong.\n"
