      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user went to a club with friends and invited 4 people to 4 drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without mentioning it. The user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are intoxicated. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user argues that they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset about the automatic 20% added without consent.\n\nFirst, consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected, and sometimes establishments add a service charge. However, if the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be an issue. The user felt this was unfair, especially since they were under the influence, which might make them more vulnerable. \n\nBut then, the user's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a direct refusal to pay any tip. That's a problem because tipping is part of the bartender's income. Even if the user was upset about the automatic addition, refusing to tip entirely might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's approach of adding a tip without informing the customer first is questionable. \n\nSo, the user's action was a reaction to the bartender's unexpected move. But in the service industry, it's generally up to the customer to decide the tip amount, not the server unless it's a pre-added service charge. If the bartender added the tip without the user's consent, that's not standard. However, the user's decision to tip 0% is a strong reaction. Maybe the user could have asked about the tip and then decided, but instead, they refused entirely. \n\nThe bartender threatening not to serve them if they don't tip is also problematic. In some places, servers can't deny service over a tip, but the user's initial refusal might be the root. However, if the bartender added the tip without approval, that's a breach of customer trust. \n\nConsidering all this, the user might not be in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate. But their response was also extreme. However, the main issue is the bartender adding a tip without permission. So, maybe the user isn't at fault here. So, answer B.\n"
