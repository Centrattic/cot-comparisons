Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people to drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and changed the tip to 0%, leading the bartender to refuse service unless they tipped. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without permission. Normally, if a server adds a tip without informing the customer, that might be considered unethical or a breach of trust, as customers should have control over their own payments.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by removing the tip, which could be seen as a justified reaction to the bartender's actions. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which might be overreacting. The person didn't tip, but the initial action of the bartender was questionable. \n\nSo, the person's response was to correct the unauthorized tip, which might be reasonable. The bartender's action was inappropriate, so the person isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
