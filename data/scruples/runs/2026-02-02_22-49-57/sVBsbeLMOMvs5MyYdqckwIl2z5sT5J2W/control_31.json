I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends and bought drinks for four people. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not overly so, noticed the added tip, and decided to tip 0%. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, standard tipping practices in the US are usually around 15-20%. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income, so not tipping can be seen as disrespectful or unfair. However, the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, which is a bit unusual. Normally, tips are left voluntarily by the customer. The user felt the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk) by not informing them before adding the tip. \n\nThe user's response of not tipping could be justified because the bartender didn't ask. But the act of not tipping at all, especially after the bartender made a move to add it, might come off as confrontational. The bartender's refusal to serve is a bit strong, but maybe he felt his livelihood was at stake. \n\nHowever, the user's main issue was the lack of communication. If the bartender had asked, the user might have still tipped appropriately or negotiated. But since the tip was added unilaterally, the user had a right to adjust it. Still, responding with 0% might be seen as overly harsh. A middle ground, like tipping a smaller percentage after discussion, might have been better. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because the bartender didn't follow the usual practice of allowing the customer to decide the tip amount. But the user could have handled it more diplomatically. The bartender's response was also extreme. So, the user's action isn't entirely wrong because the initial action of the bartender was questionable.\n"
