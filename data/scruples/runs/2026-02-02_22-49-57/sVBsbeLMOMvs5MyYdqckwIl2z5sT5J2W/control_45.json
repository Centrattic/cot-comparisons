      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping their bartender despite the bartender adding a 20% tip without permission. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to a club with friends, bought them drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and confronted the bartender, leading to the bartender refusing to serve them further. The key points here are: adding a tip without consent, the customer's reaction, and the bartender's response.\n\nI recall that in many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is expected. However, the practice of automatically adding a tip without informing the customer can be problematic. Some establishments do this as a policy, but they usually state that up front. If the bartender did this without any prior communication, that could be the root of the conflict.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender took advantage by adding the tip himself. The customer felt disrespected and chose to not tip in response. But is this justified? Well, the standard expectation is that the customer is free to decide their own tip amount. If the bartender is adding a tip unilaterally, that might be against company policy or at least against the customer's autonomy. However, in some regions, there's a practice called \"gratuity\" which is added automatically, especially for larger parties, but again, that's usually communicated beforehand.\n\nThe author was drunk but coherent enough to notice and act. So the decision to tip 0% was a conscious choice. The bartender then refused service, which could be against the law in some places. In the US, for example, businesses can't refuse service to a customer for not tipping, even if they're a regular or if the service was good. So the bartender's response might be illegal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have communicated their objection in a different way. Instead of leaving a 0% tip, maybe they could have asked the bartender to remove the added tip politely. Confronting the bartender in front of others might have escalated the situation. However, the initial act of adding the tip without permission is the main issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author wasn't in the wrong for not tipping because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. The author's right to decide their own tip amount is a customer's right. The bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the author had the right to object. The bartender's refusal to serve is also questionable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
