      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. It's usually expected, and some might see not tipping as rude or inconsiderate. However, the key point here is the bartender adding the tip without informing the customer. That might be an issue because the customer didn't have a choice. If the bartender automatically added a tip without asking, that could be seen as taking advantage, which the author is objecting to.\n\nBut wait, in some establishments, especially clubs or bars, they might add a service charge or tip automatically. However, the author mentions that the bartender did this without telling them. If that's the case, it's a bit of a problem because the customer should be informed if a tip is being added. The author's reaction of reducing the tip to 0% could be their way of reclaiming control over the tipping process. They felt the bartender was being dishonest or manipulative by adding the tip without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response of refusing to serve them might be within his rights if the establishment's policy requires a tip. But if the policy wasn't clearly communicated, the bartender's approach could be questionable. Also, the author was drunk, but not too drunk to understand the situation. However, being drunk could influence their judgment, but that doesn't necessarily make them in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the author invited four friends to four drinks. Maybe they thought the drinks were covered, and the tip was an extra. If the bartender added a tip without asking, the author might feel it's an unfair mark-up. The author's intent was to tip appropriately, but the bartender's action undermined that. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's main issue was the bartender adding the tip without permission. The author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to what they perceived as the bartender's dishonesty. The bartender's refusal to serve might be against the rules, but if the establishment allows employees to refuse service, then the author might be in a tough spot. However, the initial act of adding the tip without informing the customer is problematic. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the author's actions were a response to the bartender's actions. If the bartender acted unethically by not disclosing the tip, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if tipping is expected and the author refused to pay, they might be seen as at fault. But since the bartender didn't ask, the author's refusal isn't entirely their fault. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
