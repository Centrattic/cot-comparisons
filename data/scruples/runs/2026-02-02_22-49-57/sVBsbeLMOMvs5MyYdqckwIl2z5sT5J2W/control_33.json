      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation step by step. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping their bartender. The scenario is that they invited four friends to a club, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is willing to tip an appropriate amount but the automatic tip upset them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected for service workers. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the situation here is that the tip was added without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system might auto-tip, but maybe the bartender did it manually here. The customer felt it was unfair because they were under the influence and didn't consent to the tip.\n\nThe person's reaction was to zero out the tip, which led the bartender to refuse service. The key points here are the bartender's action of adding the tip unilaterally and the customer's response. The customer argued that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. On the other hand, the bartender might have a right to expect a tip as part of the service, especially if the customer was aware of the tipping culture beforehand.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The customer might have a point about the bartender not informing them, but refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the customer was already aware that tipping is standard. Alternatively, the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip without the customer's consent, which is a breach of trust. However, the customer's response of zeroing the tip and the argument might have been confrontational, leading to the bartender's refusal to serve.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer might not be entirely in the wrong if they were not informed and felt manipulated. However, in many cultures, tipping is expected, so not tipping could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the circumstances. The bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might be the main issue here. The customer's decision to zero the tip could be a reaction to that, but it's possible they should have communicated their discomfort first instead of removing the tip entirely.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the customer might not be entirely at fault if the bartender acted unprofessionally by adding the tip without consent. However, the expectation of tipping in such settings is strong, so the customer's refusal to tip at all could be problematic. The fact that they were drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it's not an excuse for not tipping. The bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as a consequence of the customer's actions, but he might have handled it differently. Ultimately, the customer might not be in the wrong if the bartender acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent, but there's a gray area here because tipping is customary.\n"
