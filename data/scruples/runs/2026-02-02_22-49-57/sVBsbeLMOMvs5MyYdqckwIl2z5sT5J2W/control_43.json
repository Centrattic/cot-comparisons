      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not tipping a bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The person, who was a bit drunk, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is customary, often around 15-20%. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, the customer is supposed to have control over the tip amount, so the bartender's action might be inappropriate. \n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice the added tip. Their response was to not tip, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which might be a power play. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong for not tipping? Well, if the bartender added the tip without permission, maybe the customer is justified in not adding an extra tip. However, not tipping at all could be seen as rude, but in this case, the customer is reacting to the bartender's action. \n\nAnother angle: The customer was paying for their friends, so the stakes might be higher. The bartender's action could be seen as taking advantage, so the customer's refusal to tip might be a stand against that. But is that a valid reason? \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms. In some places, tipping is expected, so even if the bartender added the tip, the customer should still tip. But if the tip is already added, maybe the customer isn't at fault for not adding more. However, if the total included the 20% tip, maybe the customer should still contribute. \n\nWait, the person said they responded by tipping 0%. If the bartender added 20% automatically, the customer might have intended not to tip beyond that, but if the total already had the tip, not adding more would be leaving the 20% as the tip. But the customer explicitly said 0%, which might mean they wanted to remove the 20% and not add anything. \n\nBut the problem is the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. So the customer's reaction is a response to that. The bartender's refusal to serve could be inappropriate. \n\nSo, is the customer at fault? If the bartender did something wrong by adding the tip, then the customer isn't wrong for not tipping. But if tipping is expected, then the customer is wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the bartender acted inappropriately by adding the tip without consent, and the customer was reacting to that.\n"
