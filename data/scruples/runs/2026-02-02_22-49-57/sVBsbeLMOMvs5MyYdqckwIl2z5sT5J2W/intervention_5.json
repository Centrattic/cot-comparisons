      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not tipping a bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they refused to tip, leading the bartender to refuse service.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author invited friends, so maybe they were the one paying for multiple people. The bartender added a tip without asking, which the author found offensive. They responded by not tipping, leading to a confrontation where the bartender threatened not to serve them. The author's defense is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk.\n\nNow, thinking about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where the customer leaves a gratuity for service. However, the bartender adding the tip without permission might be an issue. Normally, the customer controls the tip amount, and the server shouldn't decide it for them. So the bartender's action here was possibly inappropriate. \n\nBut the author's response was to leave 0%, which might be seen as confrontational. However, the author's reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk). The question is whether the author had a valid reason to refuse the tip. Since the bartender acted without consent, maybe the author was justified in taking that action. \n\nAlso, the bartender then refused service, which is a bit concerning. In some places, a bartender can't just refuse service like that without cause, but maybe there are laws about that. However, the user is asking about moral wrong, not legal. So morally, who is right?\n\nThe author might argue that the bartender crossed a line by adding the tip without permission, especially when they were drunk and vulnerable. The bartender's response could be seen as aggressive. On the other hand, refusing to tip at all might be seen as rude, but the author's action was in response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's action was a reaction to the bartender's misconduct. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
