      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid, and noticed the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by leaving 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of service industry wages. Bartenders rely on tips significantly. However, the key here is whether the bartender had the right to add a tip without the customer's consent. Typically, servers can't add a tip without the customer knowing. Some places have laws against \"silent\" tips unless the customer is informed. If the bartender added 20% without telling the author, that might be against policy or illegal, depending on the location.\n\nThe author's reaction was to leave 0%, which could be seen as a response to the bartender's unauthorized action. The author might feel that the bartender exploited their state of being drunk. However, retaliating by not tipping at all could be problematic because even if the bartender made a mistake, the author could have corrected the tip amount instead. But the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission is the initial issue here. \n\nThe bartender's threat to not serve them is also a problem. Employees can't refuse service for non-payment of tips, as tips are a separate matter from the service. Refusing service because of a tip dispute might be against the club's policy. \n\nSo the main points are: unauthorized tip addition by the bartender, the author's response, and the bartender's threat. The author might not be in the wrong if the bartender acted improperly first. However, the author could have addressed the tip correctly (maybe by discussing it and then tipping appropriately) instead of retaliating with 0%. But the bartender's initial action was wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intent was to correct an unfair action, but their method might have been inappropriate. However, given the bartender's unauthorized tip, the author has a valid point. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for not tipping in response. But if tipping is expected regardless, then not tipping is wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because the bartender's actions were at fault first, and the author's response, while possibly not ideal, was a reaction to the bartender's mistake.\n"
