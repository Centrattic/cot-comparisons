      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without saying. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice, and 20% is often considered standard for good service. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay at a register, sometimes the system might add a service charge, but the customer is usually aware. If the bartender manually added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be problematic. The customer might feel it's deceptive, especially when they were already drunk.\n\nThe customer's response was to tip 0%, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused service, which could be his right if there's a policy, but maybe that's a different issue. The question is whether the customer was in the wrong. \n\nIf the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, then the customer isn't obligated to accept it. The customer's decision to not pay the tip in that case could be seen as a reasonable response to what they perceived as an unfair or deceptive practice. However, the customer went a step further by not tipping at all, which might be seen as harsh. But given that the bartender was adding the tip without consent, the customer might have a point. \n\nAlso, the customer was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves, but the bartender's action made them feel disrespected. The bartender's refusal to serve could be because of the customer's decision to not tip, but that's a separate issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The customer might not be in the wrong because the bartender acted deceptively. However, not tipping at all in a place where tipping is expected could be seen as rude. But the context here is that the customer was already paying for the drinks, and the bartender added the tip without asking. So the customer's reaction could be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The main reason is that the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent was the initial issue. The customer's refusal to accept that and their decision to not tip in response is a reaction to the bartender's behavior, not the other way around. The bartender's threat to not serve is also questionable if the customer is refusing a tip that was added without permission. So the author isn't at fault here.\n"
