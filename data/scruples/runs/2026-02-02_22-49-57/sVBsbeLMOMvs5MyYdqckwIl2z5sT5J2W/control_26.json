      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The writer got drunk but not too much and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The writer is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for good service. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay by card or cash, the server might add a tip themselves, but they should inform the customer. If the bartender added 20% without asking, that's a problem because the customer should have control over their own tipping. The writer felt misled when the bartender took initiative without permission, which makes sense.\n\nBut the writer's response was to tip 0%, which is a strong reaction. They were drunk, so maybe their judgment was impaired. However, if they were still coherent enough to notice the tip being added and decide not to tip, that's a choice. The bartender's threat to not serve them if they didn't tip is also questionable. In some places, servers can't refuse service over a tip dispute, but that might vary by location. \n\nThe writer's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone's state (being drunk) to add a tip. But by not tipping at all, the writer is retaliating, which might be seen as their own fault. However, the initial action of the bartender was to add the tip without consent, which is the first wrong. So maybe the bartender is in the wrong for not informing the customer before adding the tip. The writer's response is a consequence of that action. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender should have asked or made it clear that a tip was being added. The writer had the right to adjust the tip, but choosing 0% might have been an overreaction. However, the bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic. It's a bit of a back-and-forth. \n\nI think the main issue is the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission. The writer's reaction is a response to that. So the writer isn't entirely in the wrong because the initial fault lies with the bartender. However, not tipping at all, even if the customer is upset, could be seen as their own choice. But considering the bartender's misconduct, the writer's actions are a justified reaction. So maybe the answer is B, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
