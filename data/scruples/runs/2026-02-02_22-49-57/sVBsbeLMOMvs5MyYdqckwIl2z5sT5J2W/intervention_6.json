      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers like bartenders around 15-20%. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, the server might ask if you want to add a tip, but if they just added it without permission, that might be problematic. The customer has the right to control their own tipping. \n\nThe author was in a state where they were drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the bartender's action and decided to respond by not tipping. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. So, the author's refusal to tip was a direct response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. \n\nLegally, adding a tip without consent might be an issue. Some places have laws that require servers to obtain consent before adding a tip. If that's the case here, the bartender could be in the wrong. Ethically, it's about respecting the customer's autonomy. The customer might feel coerced into tipping if they're not given a choice. \n\nHowever, in many service industries, tipping is expected, and not tipping can be seen as rude or disrespectful, regardless of the circumstances. The author's response of 0% and the comment about not taking advantage might be seen as confrontational. The bartender's response to refuse service if they didn't tip could also be a violation of anti-discrimination laws if they're refusing service to a customer based on their decision not to tip. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action is justified. The author didn't tip because the bartender added a tip without asking, which they found intrusive. The bartender's action could be seen as an overreach, and the author's response was a stand against that. On the other hand, not tipping at all could be seen as inconsiderate, but if the bartender was already adding a tip, maybe the author's zero tip was a way to cancel it out. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they were responding to an unauthorized tip. It's about mutual respect. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, and the author had the right to decide their own tip amount. So, answer B.\n"
