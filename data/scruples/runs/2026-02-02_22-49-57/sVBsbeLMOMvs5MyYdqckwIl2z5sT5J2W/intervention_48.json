      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without permission. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for services like bartending. Usually, people expect around 15-20%, and sometimes the establishment might auto-add a tip, but it's typically optional. The key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. That might be against the policy of some places, but maybe not all. If the bartender was allowed to do that, then maybe there's an issue. However, the customer might have the right to remove or adjust the tip if that's possible.\n\nThe author's response was to leave 0% despite the bartender's action. The author felt the bartender was taking advantage, which could be a valid concern if the bartender isn't supposed to do that. But by not tipping at all, the author is refusing to pay any tip, which might be seen as a breach of social norms. However, the bartender's initial action of adding the tip without permission could be the root of the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response\u2014refusing to serve\u2014seems extreme. If the customer is not willing to tip, the bartender can't force them, even if there's a policy. Maybe the club's policy allows for a mandatory tip, but the customer's right to refuse might depend on local laws. In some places, mandatory tips are illegal unless they are for specific services like gratuities that the establishment takes a cut. However, if the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be a problem.\n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not understanding. So their decision wasn't necessarily impaired in terms of awareness. The argument that the bartender was taking advantage might be a factor. The author might think that since they were already paying for multiple drinks, the added tip without consent was unfair. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a violation of the customer's rights, depending on the location.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the bartender added the tip without permission, that's a problem on their part. The author's response of not tipping might be a reaction to that. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as taking it too far, but if the initial act was wrong, then the author might be justified. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender initiated an unauthorized tip, and the author was asserting their right to control their own tipping. However, some might argue that the author should have just paid the tip and then addressed the issue with the management. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is problematic regardless. Therefore, the author's not tipping could be a reasonable response.\n"
