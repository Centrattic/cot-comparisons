      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, it's customary to tip service workers around 15-20%, and some people do add a tip automatically. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, the system might have default tips, but the customer should be able to adjust them. If the bartender manually added the tip without asking, that's a problem. The customer has the right to know and choose whether to tip or not.\n\nThe author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't act. They noticed the bartender's action and decided to respond by not tipping. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That's a bit of a power play. In some places, refusing service for not tipping could be against the law, as tipping is optional, though expected. But bartenders might enforce their own practices. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to tip themselves but were upset about the bartender taking initiative without consent. The bartender's response of refusing service is problematic because it's imposing a condition that might not be legal or ethical. The customer has the right to not tip, even if it's customary. However, the author didn't tip at all, which might be seen as a breach of social norms, but it's their choice. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the bartender added the tip without permission and then used that as a reason to refuse service. The author's response, while not tipping, was a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized action. However, some might argue that the author should have just tipped the standard amount and not caused a scene. But the main issue here is the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent, which is likely the bigger problem. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
