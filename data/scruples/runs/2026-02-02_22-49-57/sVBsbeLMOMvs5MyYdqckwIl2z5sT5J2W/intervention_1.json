      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that the group went to a club, the person invited four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person got drunk but wasn't too drunk to notice and then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. Typically, a 15-20% tip is expected. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the 20% tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. That might be a problem because the customer didn't agree to it. \n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. So, they might have felt that the bartender was taking an advantage of their state. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest against the unauthorized addition of the tip. But is that justified?\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's job likely depends on tips. Refusing to tip 0% might be seen as unfair to the bartender, especially if the establishment typically adds a service charge. However, if the bartender didn't inform the customer, that's a breach of trust. The bartender should have asked or at least informed them before adding the tip. \n\nThe customer's main issue is that the tip was added without their knowledge. They might have wanted to tip a different amount, maybe more or less, but the bartender decided for them. The bartender's response of refusing service because of the 0% tip is a bit harsh, especially since the customer was trying to be fair but the tip was added without permission.\n\nSo, the question is whether the customer's action of not tipping is justified. If the bartender added a tip without consent, the customer isn't obligated to pay that. The customer's decision to tip 0% might be a way to correct the mistake or express disapproval. However, completely not tipping could be seen as harsh, especially if the customer had a good experience. But in this case, the unauthorized tip might be the root of the conflict.\n\nIn many places, adding a tip without the customer's consent is not standard practice. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip. If the bartender added a tip, the customer could have pointed out the mistake and adjusted the tip accordingly. However, the customer did react by not tipping at all, which might be an overreaction, but given the bartender's unauthorized action, it could be seen as a justified response.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. The customer's action, while possibly a bit extreme, is a reaction to an initial wrongdoing by the bartender. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
