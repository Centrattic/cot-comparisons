      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then threatened to not serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected, often around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without telling the customer. Typically, it's the customer's responsibility to decide the tip amount, not the server adding it themselves. So the customer's reaction might be justified because the bartender overstepped by making that decision for them.\n\nBut wait, some places do have a policy of automatically adding a gratuity for large parties or specific services, which might be standard. The customer might not have known this was the norm, so their reaction could be based on misunderstanding. However, the customer was drunk, which might affect their judgment. But they still had the capacity to make a decision, even if it was influenced by alcohol.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response of refusing service is a strong move. Threatening not to serve someone over a tip could be seen as unprofessional. However, if the bartender's policy is to add a tip and the customer refuses, the bartender might feel justified in enforcing their policy, especially if they can't serve without proper compensation.\n\nThe customer's main issue was the bartender adding the tip without permission. If the bartender had explained the policy, maybe the customer would have agreed or discussed it. The customer's zero-tip response was a direct reaction to the bartender's action, which might be seen as a stand against being forced to pay a tip they didn't agree to. However, the customer did not tip at all, which could be considered rude regardless of the situation, even if the bartender's approach was inappropriate.\n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? On one hand, they reacted to the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip. On the other, not tipping at all is against the usual etiquette. The bartender's action was unprofessional, but the customer's response was also unkind. It's a bit of a grey area. However, since the bartender added the tip without permission, the customer's objection is understandable. The bartender's refusal to serve was perhaps harsh, but the customer's zero tip might be seen as equally problematic. Maybe the right approach is to tip appropriately without the bartender's interference. But the customer's main grievance was about the unauthorized tip, so they might not be entirely wrong.\n"
