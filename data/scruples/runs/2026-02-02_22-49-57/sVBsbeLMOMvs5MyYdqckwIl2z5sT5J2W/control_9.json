      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Here's the situation: the person went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for them, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk customers. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore unless they tipped. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In the US, tipping is common in service industries, often expected at 15-20%. However, the bartender added the tip without asking, which the customer didn't like. The customer's reaction was to not tip, which led to a conflict. \n\nThe key points here are the bartender's actions. Tipping is usually supposed to be voluntary and based on the service received. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that could be seen as deceptive or overstepping. The customer might feel that the bartender is taking advantage by not being transparent about adding the tip. However, the customer's response was to withhold all tips, which could be seen as a strong reaction. \n\nBut wait, the customer was also drunk. Their judgment might be impaired. The bartender might have thought that adding a standard tip was necessary because the customer was drunk and might not leave an appropriate one. However, the customer's main issue was that the tip was added without their consent. So the conflict arises from conflicting expectations: the bartender's assumption that a tip is expected, and the customer's belief that the tip should be voluntary and their own choice.\n\nIn some places, there might be laws about adding tips without consent. But assuming it's a voluntary tipping culture, the customer might have the right to choose not to tip. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the bartender is relying on tips for income. \n\nBut the bartender's approach of adding the tip without asking might be problematic. If the customer felt that the tip should be their decision, the bartender's action could have been inappropriate. The customer's response, while perhaps harsh, might be a reaction to that perceived overreach. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender didn't have the right to add the tip unilaterally, then the customer wasn't wrong to refuse. However, if the customer should have just left a tip regardless, then they might be at fault. The answer depends on whether the bartender's action was acceptable. Since the customer was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves, but the bartender took initiative without asking, the customer's action could be seen as a justified stand against the bartender's behavior. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
