      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author thought they were right, but wants to know if they're actually at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, usually around 15-20%. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the author. Normally, when a customer is paying, the server might add a tip, but it's customary to inform them. Adding it without asking could be seen as manipulative, especially if the customer is intoxicated.\n\nThe author was drunk but still aware enough to notice the tip being added. They responded by not tipping and confronting the bartender. The bartender's response was to refuse service, which might be within his rights if the establishment has a tipping policy. However, the initial action of adding the tip without consent could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might feel they were being taken advantage of. The bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be seen as taking advantage of someone's state (drunkenness), which the author pointed out. However, the author's decision to tip 0% after a dispute could be seen as confrontational. It's possible that the author could have tried to negotiate a fair tip amount instead of cutting it to zero.\n\nBut considering the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip, the author's response might be justified. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a policy, but the initial action was the problem. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not tipping after that. The blame might lie more on the bartender for adding the tip without consent. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
