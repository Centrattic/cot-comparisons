      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, bought them four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the customer. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice this. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, it's customary to tip service workers, especially in the US, where bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. Usually, a 15-20% tip is common, but the customer has the choice. However, the key point here is the bartender added the tip without asking. That's a bit odd. Typically, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount, either by using the payment terminal or telling the server. If the bartender just added 20% without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they were aware of the bartender's action. The customer's response was to tip 0% and accuse the bartender of trying to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's input. The customer has the right to choose. However, by responding with 0%, the author is taking a stand against the bartender's unauthorized tip. But maybe the customer could have just adjusted the tip to 0% and left, but instead, they confronted the bartender. \n\nThe bartender's response of refusing service is aggressive. Refusing to serve someone because they don't tip is against the law in many places, as customers have the right to choose their tip amount. However, the bartender might be within their rights to refuse service if the customer is being rude or causing a disturbance. \n\nSo the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. The author was within their rights to not tip, especially if they felt it was done to take advantage. But the confrontation might have escalated things. However, the bartender's response of refusing service could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), it's often about social norms. The bartender's action was questionable. The customer's response, while confrontational, was in response to an unauthorized tip. So the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a cultural expectation to tip, even if it's unauthorized. \n\nI think the key is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. The author's refusal to tip in response is justified because the tip wasn't their choice. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
