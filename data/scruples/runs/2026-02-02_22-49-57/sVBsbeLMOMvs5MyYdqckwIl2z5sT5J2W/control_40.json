      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then decided to leave 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the tipping norms in their area. In some places, like the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending, and sometimes the server adds a gratuity automatically. But the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing them. That's probably not standard practice. Usually, tips are supposed to be voluntary, and servers can't just add it without the customer's knowledge. So maybe the bartender did something wrong by not disclosing the tip. However, the person responded by leaving 0%, which might be seen as a reaction to the bartender's actions. \n\nThe person argues that the bartender was taking advantage of them being drunk. But being drunk doesn't necessarily mean you can't make a rational decision about tipping. However, if the bartender added the tip without asking, that could be a breach of trust. The person's response was to not tip at all, which might be justified if they felt disrespected. But then the bartender threatened not to serve them again, which could be his own overreaction. \n\nAnother angle: in some places, servers rely on tips as part of their income. If the customer is refusing to tip, that could affect the server's earnings. But the bartender added the tip without consent, which might be against the establishment's policies. The person might have the right to correct the tip amount, especially if they noticed it. \n\nSo, considering that the bartender acted first by adding the tip without permission, the person's response of not tipping could be a reasonable protest. However, the person's action of leaving 0% might still be seen as rude or against expectations, but the initial fault lies with the bartender. Therefore, the person might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
