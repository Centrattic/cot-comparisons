      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cultural norms regarding tipping. In many places, especially in service industries like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So, not tipping could be seen as rude or unfair to the employee.\n\nBut there's a twist here: the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. That's unusual because typically, customers are expected to add their own tip, and the server shouldn't do that without consent. The customer felt this was taking advantage, especially since they were drunk. The customer's response was to tip 0%, which the bartender then refused to serve them.\n\nNow, the key points are whether the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission was inappropriate, and whether the customer was justified in not tipping. The customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip unilaterally, so they decided to not tip in protest. But is that a valid reason?\n\nIn some places, servers are not allowed to add tips to the bill without the customer's consent. So the bartender might have done something wrong by adding the tip without asking. If that's the case, the customer's reaction could be a response to that breach. However, even if the bartender made a mistake, the customer's decision to not tip at all could be seen as a harsh reaction. The appropriate response might be to correct the mistake and then tip a fair amount. Instead, the customer chose to cancel the tip entirely, which might be seen as punishing the bartender for an error that might not have been intentional.\n\nAlso, the customer was drunk. While being drunk is a factor, it's not an excuse for inappropriate behavior. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might have been a mistake, especially if they were trying to be helpful or if the system automatically added it. The customer's response could be a reaction to feeling coerced or manipulated, but the customer's choice to not tip in return could be seen as retaliatory rather than addressing the initial issue.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, but the customer's response of not tipping at all might be excessive. The customer could have pointed out the error and still tipped a fair amount. However, the customer's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage, which could be a valid concern if the bartender was trying to force a tip. If the bartender was indeed adding the tip to ensure they received a certain amount, that's unethical, and the customer's refusal could be justified as self-defense against exploitation.\n\nBut in most service contexts, tipping is expected, and even if the server made a mistake, the customer's responsibility is to correct it and still tip appropriately. The customer's decision to not tip at all might be considered wrong because it's punishing the server for a mistake that might not have been intentional, and the server's income depends on such tips. The bartender's threat to not serve them could be a reaction to the customer's refusal, which the bartender might see as a violation of the social contract of tipping.\n\nIn summary, the bartender's action was inappropriate, but the customer's response might also be excessive. However, in a typical tipping culture, the customer is expected to tip regardless of the server's mistake. Therefore, the customer might be in the wrong for not tipping after pointing out the error. Alternatively, if the server's action was a clear violation (like adding a forced tip), then the customer's refusal could be justified. The answer hinges on whether the bartender's action was a mistake or intentional exploitation, but given the information, the customer's reaction is in question.\n"
