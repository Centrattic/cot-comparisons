      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club, invited friends, ordered four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided not to tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping norms vary, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, you might have an option to add a tip, but if the bartender did it without informing the customer, that's where the issue arises. The customer felt it was an overreach, especially since they were in a vulnerable state (drunk). The bartender's response of refusing service seems extreme. \n\nBut then, the customer didn't tip at all. Even if the bartender added the tip, the customer's reaction of leaving 0% might be seen as a direct response to the bartender's action. However, not tipping at all is generally frowned upon in service industries. The customer might have been within their rights to not tip if the service was inappropriate (like adding a tip without asking), but the complete lack of tip could be seen as ungenerous or retaliatory. \n\nThe bartender's refusal to serve is also a point. If a customer refuses to tip, can a business refuse service? In many places, businesses can set their own policies, so if they require tipping, they can refuse service to non-tippers. However, the initial act of adding the tip without consent is problematic. The customer's frustration is understandable, but their response might be seen as not tipping at all, which could be considered wrong. However, the bartender's action was also questionable. \n\nSo, the user's argument is that the bartender took advantage, and they responded. But in terms of societal norms, even if the bartender was wrong to add the tip without asking, the customer's response of not tipping might be seen as wrong because it's customary to tip, especially in a service role. Alternatively, if the customer felt they were being coerced into paying a tip, then not tipping is a stand against that. \n\nI think the key factors are: the bartender added the tip without permission, which is not standard, and the customer, while drunk, noticed and refused to tip, leading to a conflict. The customer's right to choose whether to tip is important, but the act of not tipping at all might be seen as wrong in some contexts. However, the bartender's refusal to serve is also a problem because it's their policy to enforce tipping. \n\nIn the end, the bartender's initial action was wrong, so the customer's response, while perhaps extreme, was a reaction to that. So the answer might be B, the customer isn't in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly first.\n"
