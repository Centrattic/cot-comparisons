Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, tipping is usually a personal choice, especially in places where it's customary. But if the bartender added the tip without informing the customer, that might be an issue. In some places, automatic gratuities are allowed, like for large groups or bad service, but the customer should be notified. If the bartender just added it without saying anything, that's probably against the norm. The customer had the right to know and decide. The person's reaction, even if drunk, is a response to feeling coerced. Also, the bartender threatening not to serve them could be seen as retaliation. So maybe the customer isn't wrong because they were standing up for themselves against an unexpected charge. The bartender's actions might be the problem here. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
