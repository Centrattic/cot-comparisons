I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, bought four drinks for them. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the customer. The customer, who was drunk but not to the point of not knowing what was happening, decided not to tip and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key issue is the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer. Tipping is generally a customer's choice, based on the service provided. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The customer's response was to not tip, which could be seen as a reasonable reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition.\n\nHowever, in some places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service, and some establishments do add a gratuity for large groups or certain services. But the key here is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the tip. If the customer noticed and decided against tipping as a protest, that's their right. The bartender's response of refusing service was perhaps an overreaction, but it's within his discretion to refuse service.\n\nThe person's actions were a direct response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. They were under the impression that the tip was being taken advantage of in a dishonest way. So, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because they reacted to something they found unethical. The bartender made a decision that could be seen as deceptive, and the customer's reaction was a stand against that. So, answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
