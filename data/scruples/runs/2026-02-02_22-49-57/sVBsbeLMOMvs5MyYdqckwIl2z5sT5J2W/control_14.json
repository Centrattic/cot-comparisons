      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was a bit drunk, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the service industry, tipping is expected as part of the service. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant portion of their income. If the bartender added a tip without the author's knowledge, that's unusual. Normally, the customer should have control over the tip amount. However, sometimes establishments automatically add a service charge, but that's typically for larger groups or specific services.\n\nThe author was drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the tip being added. They chose to tip 0%, which could be seen as a refusal to tip. However, the bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. The key points here are the bartender adding the tip without consent and the author's response.\n\nTipping is a social norm, but it's also a matter of personal choice. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that might be a breach of trust or an assumption about the customer's willingness to tip. The author's frustration seems justified because they were not informed. However, responding with a 0% tip might be seen as extreme, especially if the bartender was acting within the establishment's policy. But if the policy wasn't communicated, then the author's reaction could be understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's refusal to serve them if they didn't tip could be problematic. In some places, refusing service for not tipping is against the law, though in others, it might be considered a business's right. However, the act of adding a tip without the customer's knowledge is ethically questionable, as it's the customer's choice to tip, not the server's.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without the customer's knowledge, which is part of the problem. The author's decision to tip 0% in response to that unauthorized addition could be seen as a reasonable reaction, especially since they were not informed. However, refusing to tip at all when the service was provided might still be a point of contention. But given the bartender's actions, the author's response is more about protecting their own choice rather than being inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
