      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service, typically around 15-20%. But the person might have a different expectation here. The key point is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is optional and you choose it yourself. If the bartender added it without asking, that's probably against standard practice. Some places allow automatic gratuities for large groups or for service charges, but that's usually communicated upfront. Since the person noticed and decided not to tip, maybe the bartender shouldn't have done that.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to act. They might have felt the bartender was taking advantage, especially if they had a bad experience before. However, even if the person was drunk, the bartender's response of refusing service could be seen as extreme. Refusing service because a customer didn't tip might not be allowed, depending on local laws. Also, the person was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves, but the bartender's action of adding 20% without consent was the issue.\n\nSo, the person might not be in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly by adding the tip without asking. The person's reaction, while perhaps confrontational, was in response to the bartender's unauthorized action. The bartender then escalated the situation by threatening not to serve them, which could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
