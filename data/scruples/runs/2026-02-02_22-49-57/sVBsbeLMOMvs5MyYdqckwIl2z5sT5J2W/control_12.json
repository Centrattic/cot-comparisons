      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. So, the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and gave 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he won't serve them if they don't tip. The person says they were willing to tip appropriately but didn't like the bartender adding 20% without consent.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and sometimes the expectation is around 15-20%. But the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system allows you to add a tip, but if the bartender manually added 20% without asking, that might be different. \n\nThe user is arguing that the bartender shouldn't assume they want to tip that amount without consent. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip, which might be a problem because threatening service is not appropriate. But the user didn't tip at all, which could be seen as not following the expected tipping custom. \n\nSo, who's right? Well, the user had the right to choose their own tip amount. However, refusing to tip at all, especially in a place where tips are expected, can lead to conflict. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be inconsiderate, but the user's response of giving 0% could be seen as rude. \n\nBut wait, is the user in the wrong? If tipping is customary, not tipping at all is considered poor etiquette. However, the bartender's behavior of unilaterally adding a tip without permission is also questionable. The user might have had a right to be upset, but their response might have been too harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is within their right to tip as they see fit, especially if they felt the bartender overstepped. The problem is that in many service industries, not tipping is considered disrespectful, but the bartender's approach was also inappropriate. \n\nSo the answer might be that the user is not in the wrong (B), because they had the right to choose their tip and the bartender shouldn't have assumed. However, the user's decision to give 0% could still be seen as rude in some contexts. But the bartender's behavior was also at fault here. Since the user didn't know the tip was being added, it's possible they were within their right to correct that and set their own tip. So B.\n"
