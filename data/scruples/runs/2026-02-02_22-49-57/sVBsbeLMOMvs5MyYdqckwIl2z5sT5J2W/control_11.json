      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the person. The person, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then left a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve them if they didn't tip. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%, so adding 20% automatically might be within that range. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a problem because the customer isn't in control of their own payment. If the bartender added the tip without consent, that's a violation of the customer's autonomy. The customer has the right to decide how much to tip, especially if they don't want to be charged extra without being told.\n\nThen, the customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they weren't incapacitated to the point where they couldn't make a decision. The customer then decided to leave 0% as a response to the bartender's actions. That seems like a reasonable reaction given the bartender's mistake. The customer was asserting their right to control the tip amount. The bartender's response of refusing to serve them is also problematic because it's a form of coercion. The bartender can't force the customer to tip a certain amount; that's against the customer's rights. \n\nHowever, the customer might have a point in being upset because the bartender didn't inform them. But the customer's action of leaving 0% could be seen as retaliatory. If the customer intended to tip a certain amount but the bartender added 20% without permission, the customer might have wanted to correct that. But leaving 0% might not be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the customer should have informed the bartender about the automatic tip and asked to adjust it. \n\nBut considering the bartender's behavior, the customer was within their rights to object. The bartender shouldn't have taken control of the tip amount without consent. So the customer's reaction, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is understandable. The bartender's refusal to serve is unprofessional and could even be against labor policies depending on the establishment. \n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong: the bartender acted improperly by adding a tip without consent, and the customer's response, while not ideal, was a reaction to that. The customer isn't at fault here because they were defending their right to decide the tip amount. The bartender should have informed the customer before adding the tip. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
