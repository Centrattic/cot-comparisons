      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, saying not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bars and restaurants. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the user is claiming that the bartender added the tip without their knowledge, which the author found manipulative. The key points here are the bartender's actions and the author's response.\n\nThe bartender added the tip automatically. Some places do add a service charge for large groups, but it's usually disclosed. If the bartender didn't inform the customer beforehand, that could be an issue. The author felt wronged because they were drunk and didn't want to be taken advantage of. The author then decided to tip 0% instead. The bartender then refused service unless they tipped. \n\nNow, the ethical angle. Is the author in the wrong for not tipping? Well, if the bartender added the tip without consent, maybe the author is justified in not paying it, especially if they believe it's unfair. However, in many cultures, not tipping at all is considered rude, regardless of the circumstances. The author's argument is that the bartender took advantage of their state (being drunk), which could be seen as a valid concern if the tip was added without notice. But the bartender's refusal to serve is also a point. If the bartender is enforcing a tipping policy, the author's non-compliance could be seen as violating the establishment's rules.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the bartender should inform customers before adding a tip. If the author didn't want to tip, they could have left immediately. But the author's response of 0% instead of a negotiated amount might have escalated the situation. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a policy they enforce, which the author is now clashing with.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and the specific situation. In some places, not tipping is a strong breach of etiquette, but if the service was poor or the tip was added without consent, it's a gray area. Here, the author felt the tip was added without consent, so they decided not to pay. The bartender's response was to refuse service. The author's actions might be seen as wrong if the expectation is to always tip, but if the bartender's actions were deceptive, the author's response could be justified. However, the bartender is also within their rights to enforce a tipping policy. So, it's a bit of a tricky situation. \n\nI need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the arguments, the author's response of not tipping might be seen as against social norms, but the bartender's actions of adding the tip without notice could be the root issue. The user is in a gray area. However, in many societies, tipping is expected, so not tipping could be considered inconsiderate, making the author at fault. But if the bartender's method was coercive or deceptive, then the author might have a point. The answer might be A, but there's a case for B. Hmm. I think the consensus would be that the author is in the wrong because even if the bartender acted inappropriately by adding the tip without notice, the correct response would be to pay the tip they intended and then address the issue with management. Refusing to tip entirely and then being refused service is a consequence they might have to accept. So the answer is A.\n"
