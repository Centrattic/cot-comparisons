He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person went to a club with friends and invited four of them to each have four drinks. So that's probably 16 drinks total? Maybe more if they all had four. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer. The customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The customer claims they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves but the automatic tip was an issue.\n\nFirst, tipping customs vary, but in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service. If the bartender added a tip without asking, maybe the customer felt forced. However, the customer's response was to tip nothing, which is aggressive. The bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic because refusing service based on tipping could be discriminatory. But the customer's action of not tipping after the bartender already added it is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe key points: Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without the customer's consent? Possibly not. But the customer's response was to negate that tip entirely, which is a strong reaction. However, the bartender then refused service, which might be against the law in some places. The customer's argument is that the bartender was taking advantage, which could be valid if the tip wasn't optional. But the customer's reaction of 0% might be seen as rude. However, given the bartender's initial action without consent, the customer might have a point. \n\nI think the customer isn't entirely in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. But the customer's zero tip was a harsh response. However, in this context, the bartender's initial action was wrong. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
