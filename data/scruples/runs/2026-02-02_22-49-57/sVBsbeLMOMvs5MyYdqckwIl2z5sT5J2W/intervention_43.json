      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, had drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The writer was drunk but says they noticed the bartender adding the tip. They refused to tip, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender said he wouldn't serve them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected as part of the service, and sometimes it's even mandatory. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, when you pay with a card or at a register, sometimes the system might auto-add a tip, but the customer can usually remove it. However, in this case, the bartender is a person, so maybe he's manually adding the tip himself, which is unusual because the customer should have control over the tip amount.\n\nThe writer mentions that they were drunk but not so much that they couldn't notice the action. They responded by not tipping, which led to the bartender refusing service. The writer argues that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But is the writer in the wrong here?\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the writer's perspective, being forced to pay an unsolicited tip, especially when impaired, could be seen as unfair. They were trying to make a stand against being taken advantage of. However, from the bartender's side, he might have a policy or expectation of tipping, and refusing to pay could be seen as disrespectful or disruptive. \n\nBut in many service industries, tipping is entirely at the customer's discretion. If the bartender added the tip without consent, that's against standard practice. The customer has the right to adjust the tip amount. However, if there's a policy of a mandatory tip, the establishment should communicate that clearly before service. If the club has a policy where a service charge is added to all bills, that's different, but the bartender doing it himself without informing the group might not be following proper protocol.\n\nAlso, the writer's action of not tipping as a response to the bartender's unauthorized addition could be seen as a legitimate exercise of their right to decide the tip amount. However, the confrontation might have escalated unnecessarily. But if the bartender was adding tips without permission, the customer has a right to object.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, tipping is a social norm, but it's not mandatory. The writer's choice to not tip in this specific case, given the bartender's actions, might be justified. The bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as a breach of service, but if the customer is causing a scene, it's understandable from the bartender's perspective. \n\nSo, the main points are: Did the bartender have the right to add the tip without consent? Probably not. Did the writer overreact? Maybe, but their reaction was in response to the bartender's unauthorized action. The writer's stance that they want to tip appropriately on their own terms is reasonable. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
