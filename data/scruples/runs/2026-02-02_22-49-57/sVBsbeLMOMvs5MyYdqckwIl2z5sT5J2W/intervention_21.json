      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four of them for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected for service. Bartenders usually rely on tips as part of their income. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay, the server might suggest a tip amount, but it's not automatic unless the place has a policy. If the bartender unilaterally added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent, that's where the issue lies.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping, which led to a confrontation. The customer's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's intoxicated. That's a valid concern because being drunk doesn't mean you should be exploited. However, the customer's retaliation by not tipping at all might be seen as extreme, depending on the context.\n\nBut wait, the customer was willing to tip an appropriate amount themselves. So maybe they just wanted to control the amount and not have it forced upon them. The bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be seen as overstepping. In some places, servers can't add tips without the customer's consent. So the customer's refusal might be justified as a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender could argue that he's just doing his job, expecting a tip, and the customer's refusal is disrespectful. However, the bartender's threat to not serve them is also problematic. It's not appropriate to refuse service based on a disagreement over tipping unless it's against the venue's policy, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the customer's main issue was the bartender adding the tip without consent. Their response was to not tip, which might be a bit harsh, but the initial action by the bartender was the root problem. Therefore, the customer isn't entirely at fault.\n"
