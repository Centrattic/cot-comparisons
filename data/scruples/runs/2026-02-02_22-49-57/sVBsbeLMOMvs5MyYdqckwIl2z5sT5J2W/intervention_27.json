      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is part of the service industry, and 15-20% is typical. However, the bartender added the tip without asking. That's a bit of an issue. The customer has the right to decide their own tip amount. If the bartender assumed they would tip and added it without consent, that could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe person was already paying for multiple people. Maybe the cost was higher, and the bartender's action of adding 20% without permission made them feel like they were being taken advantage of. They were drunk but not too drunk to notice and respond. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. That's a conflict. The customer might have felt forced into a situation where they were being pushed to tip more than they wanted.\n\nBut, the author didn't tip at all, which is against the usual expectation. Even if the bartender added a tip without asking, the appropriate response might have been to adjust the tip amount rather than zero. The threat from the bartender to not serve them if they didn't tip could be seen as a power play. However, the author's action of not tipping might have been a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized addition.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The bartender added a tip without permission, which isn't standard practice. The customer's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a stand against the bartender's action. However, the customer's choice to not tip at all, even after being invited to tip, might be problematic. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent is a key point here. The customer's reaction might be justified if they felt coerced or manipulated.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the bartender's actions were inappropriate. The author's response was to stand up against what they perceived as taking advantage. So, the answer is B.\n"
