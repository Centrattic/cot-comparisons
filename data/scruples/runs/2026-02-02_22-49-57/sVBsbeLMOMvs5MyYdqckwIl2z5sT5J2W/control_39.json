      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too much to notice. They tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person argues that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, so they didn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The usual practice is that customers add a tip, sometimes 15-20%, either manually or the establishment might add it automatically. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip himself without informing the customer. The customer found this unethical, especially since they were already paying for multiple people's drinks. \n\nThe person's reasoning is that the bartender should not have assumed the right to add a tip unilaterally. They felt it was an overreach, especially in a situation where they were intoxicated but still aware of the action. Their response was to refuse the tip as a form of protest, which led to the bartender threatening not to serve them.\n\nNow, is the person in the wrong? On one hand, the bartender was adding a tip that is typically expected by the customer. If the customer didn't want to tip, they could have adjusted it, but instead, they set it to 0%, which is against the usual custom. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might be seen as crossing a line. Some places have policies where tips are automatically added, but it's usually communicated to the customer beforehand. If the bartender did this without prior notice, the customer might feel it's deceptive.\n\nThe person's argument is that they were not in a position to be taken advantage of, especially when drunk. But tipping is meant to be a voluntary gesture, though in practice, it's expected. The conflict arises from the bartender's unilateral action. The person's refusal might be seen as a stand against that practice, but it's also against the norm, which could make them the antagonist in traditional views.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The person was paying for multiple friends, so the total amount might have been significant. The bartender's action could be seen as trying to get a higher tip without the customer's consent. The person's response, while perhaps too harsh, might be a reaction to feeling disrespected or taken advantage of. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the establishment's policy is to add tips automatically, the customer should be informed. If not, the bartender overstepped. The customer's refusal to tip then could be justified as a protest, but it's conflicting with the usual custom. So, depending on the establishment's policy and communication, the bartender's actions might be at fault here. If the policy isn't clear, both sides have points. However, the customer's action of setting 0% is against the norm, which might make them \"in the wrong\" from a traditional perspective. But if the bartender acted unethically by adding the tip without consent, the customer's response could be seen as justified. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on the establishment's policies. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent, the customer's reaction could be understandable. However, the act of not tipping at all is still against the norm. The user might lean towards the author being in the right (B) because the bartender's action was problematic. Alternatively, if the bartender was just following the standard practice, the author's refusal is the issue. Since the question doesn't mention the establishment's policy, it's unclear, but the bartender's unilateral action is a key point. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the bartender's actions were questionable.\n"
