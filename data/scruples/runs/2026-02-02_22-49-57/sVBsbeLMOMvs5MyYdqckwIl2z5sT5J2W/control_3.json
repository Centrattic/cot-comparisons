I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not tipping the bartender even though the bartender added a 20% tip without being told. The author got angry because the bartender tried to put in the tip himself, and then the author left 0%, leading to the bartender threatening not to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers, and 15-20% is standard. However, the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's approval. Normally, when you pay with a card, the system might allow servers to add a tip, but some places require the customer's consent first. If the bartender did this without asking, maybe the customer had a right to be upset because they felt it was an overreach.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping, which led to the bartender refusing service. The author's reasoning was that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. However, the author's action of leaving 0% might be seen as retaliatory. Even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the appropriate response might have been to correct the tip amount politely rather than completely refuse to tip, which could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking could be problematic. Some places might have policies allowing servers to add tips, but if it's against the establishment's policy or if the customer objects, then the bartender might be at fault. But service workers often rely on tips for a significant part of their income, so refusing to tip could be seen as unfair to them, especially if the customer had a valid reason but could have handled it differently.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, maybe the author had a reason to be upset. However, the author's response of leaving 0% is a direct attack on the bartender's earnings. Even if the bartender did something wrong, the customer's response might be seen as harsh. The author could have pointed out the incorrect tip and adjusted it themselves, rather than leaving nothing. Therefore, the author's action of not tipping could be considered wrong because it harms the service worker's income without a fair resolution. The bartender's response of refusing to serve might be an overreaction, but the author's initial action was also a violation of tipping etiquette in many contexts.\n"
