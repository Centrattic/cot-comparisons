      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling them, and when the person noticed, they responded with a 0% tip, leading to a confrontation where the bartender refused to serve them further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bartending. A typical tip is around 15-20%. The user was in a club, which might have higher expectations for tipping compared to a regular bar. However, the bartender added the 20% without consulting the customer. That's a bit unusual because usually, the customer decides the tip amount, and the bartender doesn't have the authority to add it automatically unless it's a preset policy. But sometimes, some places do include a service charge, which is different from a tip.\n\nThe user was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They felt the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip himself, which is a valid concern if the customer wasn't informed. The user then decided to leave 0% as a response. The bartender then refused to serve them, which is also a bit of a problem because refusing service can be a last resort but might be justified if the customer is being disrespectful.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was the bartender allowed to add a tip without informing? If the venue has a policy of adding a service charge, the bartender might be following it. However, if there's no such policy, adding a tip unilaterally could be seen as overstepping. The user's reaction, while perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, is a response to something they perceived as unfair. However, not tipping at all is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, as bartenders rely on tips for a significant portion of their income.\n\nThe user might argue that the bartender shouldn't have assumed their tip amount, but the appropriate action would be to ask or to leave a comment, not to retaliate with zero tipping. The situation escalated when the bartender refused service, which is a common response to a customer being difficult, but the initial issue is about the user's decision not to tip.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user's action of not tipping is the main point in question. While the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission might have been wrong, the user's response was to withhold a tip entirely, which is the standard way to show dissatisfaction. However, in many cultures, not tipping is seen as the customer's fault regardless of the circumstances. So the answer would lean towards the user being in the wrong (A) because they didn't tip, even if the bartender's actions were questionable. The user could have addressed the issue more appropriately, like telling the bartender they wanted to adjust the tip or not, without leaving zero.\n"
