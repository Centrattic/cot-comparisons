      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a club visit where the author invited four friends to drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer, leading the author to tip 0% and accuse the bartender of taking advantage. The bartender then threatened not to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the norms around tipping. In many places, tipping is a common practice where customers voluntarily add a percentage to service charges. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without asking or informing the customer. Normally, tips are at the customer's discretion. Automatically adding a tip without consent might be considered unethical, especially if it's not standard practice in that establishment.\n\nThe author was drunk but functional enough to notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping and confronting the bartender. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is a problem because service refusal based on tipping could be illegal in some places, as tipping is supposed to be voluntary.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone's state (even if they're drunk). While being drunk might affect judgment, it's not a reason for the bartender to impose a tip without consent. However, the author's decision to tip 0% after the bartender added 20% might be seen as a reaction, but is their action justified?\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the initial issue was the bartender adding the tip without permission. The author had the right to decide their own tipping amount. The real issue is the bartender's action of adding the tip unilaterally. The author's response, while perhaps harsh (0% tip), was a reaction to what they perceived as unfair treatment. The bartender's threat to not serve them for not tipping could also be problematic, as it's up to the customer to decide whether to tip, and denying service over that might be against the law in some regions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
