      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking, then the author, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% instead, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially places like bars or restaurants, tipping is expected as part of the service. Bartenders usually rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, the system might let you add a tip, but if the bartender manually added 20% without asking, that could be an issue. The customer might feel it's their decision whether to tip or not, and being forced into a tip could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the customer is intoxicated.\n\nHowever, the customer's response was to tip 0%, which is against standard etiquette. Even if they were upset, not tipping at all might be excessive. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip might also be against company policy, as refusing service can lead to legal issues or negative reviews.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But the customer had the agency to refuse the tip. However, in many places, the customer's right to choose their tip is absolute. The bartender shouldn't unilaterally add a tip. So maybe the bartender was in the wrong. But the customer then retaliated by not tipping, which could be seen as their own mistake. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fact that the bartender added the tip without permission could mean the author was justified in objecting. However, responding with 0% tip might not be the best approach. Maybe the appropriate action would have been to remove the tip or ask for it to be adjusted, rather than leaving nothing. So the author might share some blame for not tipping, but the initial action of the bartender was problematic. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often expect a certain level of tipping. Even if the bartender did something wrong, the customer's response was also improper. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't tip, even if there was an issue with the added tip. However, the bartender shouldn't have added it without consent. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of who is more in the wrong, the author's choice to not tip might be considered wrong in the eyes of the community, even if there's a misunderstanding. So the answer might be A.\n"
