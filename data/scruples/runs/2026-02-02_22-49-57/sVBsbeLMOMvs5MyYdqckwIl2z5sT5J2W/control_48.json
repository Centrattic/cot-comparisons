      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author going to a club with friends, inviting four friends to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping in the service industry. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected for services like bartending. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. So, not tipping at all could be seen as disrespectful or unfair, especially if the service was good. However, the situation here is a bit different because the bartender added a tip automatically without informing the customer. That might be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's friends were invited for drinks, which might mean the bill was higher. If the author paid for everyone, the expectation of tipping might be even more pronounced. But here, the bartender took it upon himself to add 20% without asking. The author responded by refusing to tip, which led to the bartender threatening not to serve them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the key issue is whether automating a tip without informing the customer is acceptable. If the bartender had a policy of adding a tip for groups or large parties, that's one thing. But if it's done without the customer's knowledge, it could be seen as overstepping. The author's reaction was to not tip in return, which could be a form of protest. However, the bartender's response of refusing service if the tip wasn't given is a strong move. \n\nIn some places, businesses don't allow customers to remove an automatic gratuity, so if the bartender added it, the author might have no choice but to pay it, even if they didn't like it. But if it's against the club's policy to add tips without the customer's consent, then the bartender was in the wrong for adding it without asking. \n\nThe author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people, which is a valid point. However, the author's solution was to not tip at all, which could harm the bartender's income. It's a conflict between the customer's right to control their spending and the service worker's right to expected compensation. \n\nSo, depending on local practices and the establishment's policies, the answer could vary. If the club allows customers to adjust the tip, then the author might be justified in removing the tip. But if the tip is mandatory, the author's refusal could be the wrong move. Since the bartender added the tip without consulting the customer, the author's reaction, while perhaps confrontational, might be a response to an unfair practice. However, the act of not tipping at all, regardless of the reason, can be seen as inconsiderate in many service industries. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a reaction to the bartender's unauthorized tip addition. The bartender's response of refusing service is also aggressive. The author might not be in the wrong if the tip was added without their consent, but in many cases, automatic gratuities are standard for groups, so the author's refusal might still be viewed as inconsiderate. However, the bartender's approach of adding the tip without asking could also be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but if the club's policy doesn't allow customers to adjust the tip, the author is in the wrong. If the policy does allow it, then the author isn't. Since the question doesn't specify local policies, but the author felt the tip was added without permission, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). However, in many contexts, not tipping at all is considered wrong regardless of the reason. So it's a tough call, but I think the author's refusal to tip in response to an unauthorized tip might be justified, making them not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
