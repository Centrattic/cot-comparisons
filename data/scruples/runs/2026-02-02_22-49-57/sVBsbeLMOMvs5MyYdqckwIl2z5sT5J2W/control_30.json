      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. So, the person went to a club with friends, invited four of them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without saying anything. The person got upset because they didn't want to be taken advantage of when drunk and decided to tip 0%, leading the bartender to threaten not to serve them anymore.\n\nHmm, the first thing I need to consider is the usual tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the service industry, a standard tip is around 15-20%. Bartenders often rely heavily on tips as a significant part of their income. So, if the bartender added 20% automatically, maybe that's their usual practice. But the person felt it was done without their consent, especially since they were drunk. Wait, but even if someone is drunk, isn't it their responsibility to manage their own tipping? Or does the bartender have a duty to check with the customer before adding a tip?\n\nOn the other hand, the person claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount if the bartender hadn't done it first. But by adding the 20% without asking, maybe the bartender assumed the customer would be fine with it. However, the customer felt it was an overreach. The key here is whether adding a tip without asking is acceptable. Some places do that, but maybe in this context, the customer expected to choose their own tip. \n\nAlso, the person's response was to tip 0%, which is a refusal. The bartender then refused to serve them. Is that a valid response? Bartenders can refuse service for various reasons, including if someone is being aggressive or not tipping. But is it justified in this case? If the customer is not drunk enough to not notice the tip being added, maybe they didn't act aggressively. The bartender did add the tip without permission, which the customer found unethical. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? If the bartender's action was within standard practice, maybe the customer isn't at fault for objecting. However, the service industry often expects tips, and not tipping at all could be seen as disrespectful. But the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking might have been the initial issue. \n\nAnother angle: the person invited four friends to four drinks, so perhaps the total bill was significant. If the bartender is supposed to handle tips as part of their income, maybe the customer's refusal to tip is problematic. But if the bartender added the tip without consulting, the customer might have a right to be upset. \n\nI think the main point is whether it's acceptable to add a tip automatically. In some places, this is common, but the customer might not be aware. The person's reaction of tipping 0% could be a response to the bartender's action, not necessarily a refusal to tip altogether. However, the bartender's refusal to serve might be a consequence of the customer's actions. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, maybe the customer isn't entirely at fault because they were reacting to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. However, in the service industry, expecting some form of tip is standard, and refusing to tip could be seen as unreasonable. But since the bartender took the initiative, maybe the customer's reaction is justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they were reacting to the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent. The bartender should have checked with the customer before adding the tip. However, the customer's choice to tip 0% might be problematic. But considering the context of the bartender's initial action, the customer's response could be seen as a defense against being taken advantage of, even if they were drunk. So, B seems more likely.\n"
