      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they invited four friends to a club and paid for four drinks for each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of them. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% aligns with that. But the key issue here is whether the author was aware of the automatic tip. The author says they noticed the bartender trying to put the tip in, so maybe the bartender didn't actually ask or confirm. \n\nWhen someone is under the influence of alcohol, their judgment can be impaired. However, the author mentions they were not too drunk to notice the tip being added. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, which is a common concern. The response was to tip 0% and challenge the bartender's actions. The bartender then refused service, which is a bit aggressive. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author was wrong. The author's intention was to tip an appropriate amount themselves but didn't want the bartender to add it without consent. Automatically adding a tip without informing the customer might be against the restaurant's policy. If the bartender didn't ask, the author might have a point in being upset. However, the author's action of not tipping at all could be seen as retaliatory. Instead of just canceling the tip, maybe they should have discussed the matter or adjusted the tip amount after the fact. \n\nBut the author's argument is that the bartender took advantage, so they refused the tip. The bartender's response of refusing to serve is problematic because it's not the customer's fault the tip was added. The author might not be in the wrong here. On the other hand, the author could have handled it more politely by adjusting the tip themselves once they saw the 20% and still tipped appropriately. \n\nI need to check if the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent is acceptable. Some places do add a gratuity for large groups, but in this case, the author was paying for their friends. If the establishment automatically adds a tip without notifying the customer, that's an issue. The author's right to decide the tip amount themselves is valid. The bartender's refusal to serve was unprofessional. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The bartender's actions were inappropriate, and the author had the right to express their dissatisfaction. However, a better approach might have been to tip an appropriate amount themselves after noticing the added tip. But the main point is that the bartender shouldn't have forced the author to tip. The author's response was justified given the circumstances.\n"
