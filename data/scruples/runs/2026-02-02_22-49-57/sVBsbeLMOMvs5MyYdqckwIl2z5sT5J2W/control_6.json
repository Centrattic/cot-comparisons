      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four others to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person got mad, left 0% tip, and the bartender refused to serve them after that.\n\nFirst, tipping is typically a personal choice in many places. However, bartenders often rely on tips as part of their income. The person was drunk but claims they noticed the bartender adding the tip without permission. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of a drunk customer by automatically adding a tip. \n\nThe bartender's action of adding a 20% tip without informing the customer might be against the establishment's policy. Some places might have automatic gratuities for large groups or events, but the customer wasn't informed. If the bartender did that without consent, it's unethical. The customer's response of not tipping could be justified if they felt misled. However, the customer could have asked for the tip to be removed or discussed it instead of leaving 0% and confronting the bartender. \n\nThe bartender's threat to not serve them anymore could be a separate issue. Threatening service because of a disagreement over tipping is not appropriate. \n\nSo, the key points are: automatic tipping without consent, the customer's reaction being to withhold all tips, and the bartender's hostile response. The customer might have a valid point about being misled, but their method of response (0% tip and confrontation) is questionable. The bartender also acted inappropriately by adding the tip without permission and threatening service. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, both parties have some fault. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, and the customer's response was harsh. However, the question is whether the author (the customer) is in the wrong. Since the bartender's action was the initial issue, the customer's reaction might be understandable, but the zero tip is problematic. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the bartender initiated the problem, but I'm a bit conflicted. Another angle: if the customer was drunk, maybe they shouldn't have been confrontational. But the bartender shouldn't exploit that. Hmm. I think the bartender is more at fault here, so the answer would be B.\n"
