      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The situation involves a group of friends going to a club, with the author inviting four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was a bit drunk but not to the point of not being aware, decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in the service industry, including bars and restaurants. Bartenders often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, a tip is supposed to be a voluntary gesture from the customer, not something the server can impose.\n\nThe author's response was to leave a 0% tip, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's actions. But the author also mentions that they were willing to tip an appropriate amount. However, by not tipping at all, they might be perceived as being inconsiderate. On the other hand, the bartender's action of adding a tip without asking might have crossed a line, as the customer should have control over the tipping amount.\n\nAnother angle is the social norm. If the bartender assumed a tip, maybe the establishment has a policy of automatic gratuities for large groups, which is sometimes done in restaurants. But the author didn't know about this, so there might be a communication issue. The bartender didn't inform them, leading to confusion.\n\nThe author's response of zero tipping is a direct reaction to the bartender's action. Whether this is justified depends on the expectation of voluntary tipping. If the customer feels that the server cannot force a tip, then not tipping could be their way of standing up for that right. However, the bartender then threatened to not serve them, which escalates the situation. Legally, in some places, you can't force a tip, so the bartender can't legally refuse service over a tip. But in practice, the bartender can choose not to serve someone, so the author might have been in a dilemma.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking, then the author's refusal to pay it isn't their fault. However, if the author should have tipped regardless, even if the bartender added it by mistake, then they are in the wrong. The key here is the bartender's action. If the bartender made an error, the author's response is understandable. But if the establishment's policy is to add a tip, then the author might be in the wrong for not following it. Since the author didn't know the policy and the bartender didn't explain, the fault might lie with the bartender for not communicating. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without informing them. The author's refusal was a response to that action, and they were willing to tip appropriately. However, not tipping at all could be seen as harsh, but the initial action by the bartender was the main issue. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
