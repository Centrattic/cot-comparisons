      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid, and the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The usual range is 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be within that norm. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That could be a problem because the customer might not have agreed to it, especially if they were under the influence.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender adding the tip. They decided to tip 0% as a response, which led to the bartender refusing service. The customer's reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage by adding the tip without consent. But is that a valid argument? \n\nTipping is typically voluntary, and while some establishments might have an automatic gratuity added for large groups or other reasons, the customer should be informed. If the bartender added the tip without permission, that's against the customer's autonomy. However, in some places, automatic gratuities are standard for events like weddings or large parties, but a club setting with friends might not be the same. \n\nAlso, when the customer refused to tip, the bartender refused to serve them. That's a problem because the customer had already paid for the drinks. The bartender can't refuse service after the payment has been processed unless there's a policy in place about mandatory tips. But in many cases, the customer has the right to decide their tip amount, even if it's zero. \n\nSo, the bartender's response of refusing service might be inappropriate. The customer's issue was that the tip was added without their knowledge. If they didn't want to tip, they have the right to do so, even if it's zero. The bartender shouldn't have forced a tip or denied service after the fact. \n\nBut wait, in some regions, there might be laws about mandatory tips. For example, in some places, a service charge can be added for groups over a certain size. If the group was four people, that might not qualify. However, the key is whether the customer was informed. If the bartender added the tip without informing, that's against the customer's wishes. \n\nIn terms of the customer's responsibility, they might have the right to not tip, but the bartender adding the tip without consent is also an issue. The customer's response was to not tip in return, which is their right, but the bartender's response of refusing service after the payment might be the wrong action. \n\nSo, considering all this, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to not tip, especially since the tip was added without their consent. The bartender's actions might be more at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
