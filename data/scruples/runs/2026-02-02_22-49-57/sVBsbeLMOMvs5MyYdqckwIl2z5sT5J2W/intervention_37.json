I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. So maybe they had drinks for a group? When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and tipped 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping.\n\nHmm. So in the US, tipping is usually expected, right? Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. But here, the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, the customer should know their tip amount. If the bartender added 20% without permission, that's a problem. The customer might have been planning to tip less or differently. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. Then they refused to tip, which led to the bartender not serving them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they should have just paid the 20% tip and moved on. But the bartender didn't ask, so the customer had the right to object. However, by tipping 0%, they might have violated the tipping norm, which could be seen as rude. But the bartender's action was also inappropriate. So maybe the author isn't wrong for objecting. They had the right to refuse an unauthorized tip. The bartender shouldn't have made that decision for them. The author's response was to tip 0%, which is extreme, but perhaps justified given the bartender's actions. Alternatively, maybe they should have tipped a small amount instead. But the main issue is the bartender adding the tip without consent. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
