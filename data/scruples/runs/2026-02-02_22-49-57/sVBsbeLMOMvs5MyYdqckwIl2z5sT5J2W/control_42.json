      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person claims they were willing to tip an appropriate amount but were upset about the automatic 20% added without consent.\n\nHmm. So, first, in many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, but it's not always automatic. Some places might add a gratuity for large groups or events, but if it's a regular customer and not a group, that might not be the case. The person is upset because the bartender added the tip without asking. But wait, maybe the bartender was just using the standard tip percentage that the restaurant applies automatically. If that's the case, the person might not have had a choice regardless. But maybe the bartender was doing it on their own, not as per the establishment's policy. \n\nThe person was drunk, but they say they were not so drunk they couldn't notice. They responded by not tipping, which led to conflict. The bartender threatened not to serve them. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a social norm perspective, tipping is customary in many service industries, especially in places like bars and clubs where the bartender's income relies on it. If the person didn't tip, even if the bartender added a percentage, maybe they should have tipped regardless. However, the key here is that the bartender added the 20% without the customer's knowledge. If the establishment doesn't inform customers that a gratuity is automatically added, that might be an issue. \n\nBut in many cases, especially in places where tipping is expected, customers are expected to leave a tip. If the person chose not to tip because they were mad that the bartender added it, but they didn't know about it, maybe they should have just left the automatic tip as is. However, if the bartender added it without the customer's consent, perhaps the customer has a right to be upset. \n\nBut the person's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as retaliatory. The bartender's response of refusing service might be within their rights if the policy requires tipping. So, the person's refusal to tip could be seen as the wrong move here. \n\nAlternatively, if the bartender added the tip without informing them, perhaps the customer is justified in not paying it, especially if they were drunk and felt taken advantage of. However, the customer could have asked to remove the automatic tip instead of retaliating. \n\nThe main points are: was the automatic tip added by the establishment's policy or the bartender's own doing? If it's the former, the customer might have no control and should leave it. If it's the latter, maybe the customer has a point. But in any case, not tipping and causing a conflict might be seen as wrong. \n\nAlso, the bartender threatening not to serve them if they don't tip could be a separate issue. In some places, employees can't force customers to tip, but the customer's response of not tipping could be seen as the initial wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping in retaliation, even if they felt wronged. The proper approach would have been to ask about the automatic tip and then decide to pay or not, rather than refusing to tip at all. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
