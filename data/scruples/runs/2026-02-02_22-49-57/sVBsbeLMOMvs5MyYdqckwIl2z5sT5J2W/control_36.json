      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four friends. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender responded by saying he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The person is now asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. So not tipping might be seen as rude. But the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. That's unusual. Normally, you can choose your own tip, or sometimes the place might automatically add a gratuity for large parties, but maybe that's not common for a small group. The person might have felt that the bartender was being overzealous, especially since the person was drunk and might have been more vulnerable.\n\nThe person's reaction was to tip 0%, which could be seen as standing up for themselves, especially if they felt the bartender was being deceitful. But on the other hand, refusing to tip entirely might be considered inconsiderate, even if the bartender's action was questionable. The bartender then refused service unless they tipped, which is a possible escalation. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The bartender's automatic addition of a tip without consent is problematic. The customer has the right to know what's being added to their bill. However, the customer's response of tipping 0% and being confrontational might have been the other side of the coin. The bartender's refusal to serve could be within their rights if there's a policy, but maybe not if it's just a personal decision.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender might have overstepped, but the customer's response was also aggressive. However, the customer did point out the issue, which is valid. Maybe the right approach would have been to tip an appropriate amount themselves and then address the bartender's behavior after the transaction. But since they were drunk, maybe their judgment was impaired.\n\nSo, the person might not be entirely in the wrong because the bartender's actions were questionable. But they also didn't tip, which is usually expected. However, the context is that the bartender added the tip without asking, which could be seen as taking advantage. The answer might hinge on whether the customer's refusal to tip is justified given the bartender's actions. In that case, the person might not be at fault. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
