      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed the tip and decided to not tip at all, saying not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected, and sometimes added automatically by the establishment. However, the person in this scenario felt that the bartender added the tip without their knowledge, which upset them. They responded by not tipping at all, which led to the bartender refusing service.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, tipping is typically a customer's choice, even if it's automatically added. However, some places may have policies where a service charge is included, but the customer can adjust it. If the bartender added 20% without asking, maybe the customer had the option to change it. The person here chose to leave 0%, which could be seen as a right decision if they felt the tip wasn't their choice. But the bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip might be problematic because it's the customer's choice, even if tips are part of the service.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have been following standard practice, but the customer's reaction was confrontational. However, the customer was drunk, which complicates things. But regardless of being drunk, customers have the right to choose their tip amount. The bartender can refuse service if they don't want to serve someone, but that might be a bit heavy-handed. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, by not tipping, they might be going against the expected norm, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission could be the root issue. The author's response was to leave 0%, which is their right, but the bartender's refusal to serve is also a point of contention. However, the author's justification was that the bartender was taking advantage of a drunk person. The author might not be in the wrong if they felt the tip was forced. Alternatively, the author could have adjusted the tip to a lower amount instead of 0%, but they chose to leave nothing. \n\nIn many places, the customer can adjust tips even if they're auto-added. So if the bartender added 20%, the customer could have left 15% or something. But the author left 0%, which is a strong reaction. So maybe the author did overreact by leaving nothing, but the initial act of the bartender adding the tip without permission is also questionable. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the author's decision not to tip is a choice, but the bartender's refusal to serve might be an overreaction. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had the right to tip as they saw fit, but they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender is allowed to add tips, maybe the author should have adjusted it. But if the bartender didn't inform the customer, maybe the author's reaction is justified. \n\nI think the key point is that tipping is a customer's choice. If the bartender added a tip without permission, the author had the right to adjust it. However, leaving 0% might be too harsh, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for doing so. The bartender's response of refusing service might be more at fault here. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
