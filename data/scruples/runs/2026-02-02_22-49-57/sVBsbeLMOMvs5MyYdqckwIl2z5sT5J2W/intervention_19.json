Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The key points here are: the author invited four friends for drinks, ended up paying the bill. The bartender added a 20% tip without telling the author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice. The author refused to tip because they felt the bartender was taking advantage, leading the bartender to refuse service unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary but not mandatory. However, servers often rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The author's main issue is that the bartender added the tip without permission. But the author then refused to tip, which led to conflict.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were being taken advantage of, especially while drunk. But the problem is, even if the tip was added without permission, the author could have paid it and then confronted the bartender. Instead, they chose to not tip at all, which could be seen as retaliatory. Also, the bartender's response of refusing service might be within their rights if the establishment requires a minimum tip or if they have a policy against serving rude or non-tipping customers.\n\nAnother angle: the author invited friends and might have been responsible for the bill. If the bartender added the tip without asking, that's a bit of an issue, but the author's response of zero tip could be seen as uncooperative. Maybe the author should have paid the tip they were comfortable with instead of refusing entirely. However, there's also the argument that if the bartender is adding tips without consent, that's not right either. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were being taken advantage of when under the influence. But being drunk doesn't absolve someone from social responsibilities like tipping. The bartender's action might have been wrong, but the author's response could be seen as equally problematic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, refusing to tip entirely might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially in a place where tipping is expected. However, if the author felt coerced into tipping more than they wanted, that's a different issue. The bartender adding the tip without asking is possibly against the establishment's policies, but the author's refusal to tip after that might not be in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the bartender's action was the initial problem. However, the author's response of zero tip might have been a mistake. A more appropriate action could have been to pay the bill without the added tip and then discuss it. But since the author was drunk, maybe they acted impulsively. Still, the bartender's refusal to serve could be seen as justified if the customer was being rude or non-compliant. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the bartender's action was the main issue, and the author was reacting to being taken advantage of. However, there's a nuance here where both parties might have made mistakes. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the bartender added the tip without consent, the author's response, while perhaps not the best, isn't entirely their fault.\n"
