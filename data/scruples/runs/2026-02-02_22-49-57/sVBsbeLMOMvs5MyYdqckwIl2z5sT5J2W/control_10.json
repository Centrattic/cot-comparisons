      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends and paid for their drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, feeling drunk but still aware, decided to tip 0% in response, leading to a confrontation where the bartender refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the usual tipping norm in many places, especially in the US, is around 15-20% for good service. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, when you pay with a card or through a system, sometimes the tip is optional and you can choose your percentage. But if the bartender manually added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's a problem. The user might feel disrespected because they weren't given the choice to decide their own tip based on the service they received. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender might have assumed that the user intended to tip, which is standard practice. But the user's response of 0% could be seen as a direct reaction to the bartender's action. However, refusing to serve someone over a tip is a bit harsh, but bartenders do have the right to refuse service if they feel disrespected or if the customer is being problematic. \n\nThe user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, implying that the tip was forced. But if the user is responsible for their own tipping, they should have the autonomy to decide. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might have been the initial issue. However, the user's decision to not tip at all could be seen as a poor response, especially if they were aware they were drunk and might not have made the best decision. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the main point is whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without permission. If that's against restaurant policy, then the bartender is in the wrong. However, if it's a common practice where tips are automatically added, the user might be expected to adjust that. However, since the user noticed and chose not to tip, the bartender's refusal to serve could be a breach of the customer's right to choose. \n\nIn the end, both parties have some responsibility. The bartender shouldn't force a tip, and the user should have communicated their intent to tip appropriately but choose the amount. The user's decision to not tip in response might be justified as a protest against the forced addition, but the bartender's refusal to serve is an overreaction. However, depending on the establishment's policies, the bartender might have the right to refuse service. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent was the initial issue. The user's response, while confrontational, was a reaction to that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
