      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking, and the user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, then tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service staff like bartenders. It's usually expected as a gratuity for the service provided. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, the customer should have control over the tip amount, and pre-adding it without consent might be an issue.\n\nThe user's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's action. But if they were willing to tip an appropriate amount, maybe they wanted to decide the amount themselves. The bartender's refusal to serve them could be a problem because service should be provided regardless of the tip, unless there's a policy against it. However, the bartender might have a policy or expectation that tips are mandatory.\n\nBut the user was drunk, which might affect their judgment. However, that doesn't excuse not tipping if it's customary. But the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission could be the root issue. The user's frustration is understandable if they felt disrespected by having the tip imposed on them.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The bartender's action was questionable, but the customer's response was to not tip. However, in many places, even if a tip is added automatically, the customer can adjust it. The user decided to not tip at all, which might not be the best approach. They could have corrected the tip amount themselves. By leaving 0%, they might be violating the social norm, even if the bartender made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, the bartender shouldn't have pre-added the tip without asking. That's not standard practice. The user's response, while perhaps not the best, was a reaction to the bartender's actions. So maybe the blame isn't entirely on the user. But in the end, if the user was willing to tip an appropriate amount, maybe they should have adjusted the tip instead of leaving 0%. The bartender's refusal to serve them could be against the law in some places, but that's a separate issue.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that the user isn't entirely in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate, but the user's response could have been better. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the key issue is the automatic tip, the answer might be B (No). But there's nuance here. The user's choice to not tip at all could be seen as wrong, but the initial action by the bartender was also wrong. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The user might be at fault for not tipping, but the bartender's behavior started the conflict. However, in terms of the user's responsibility, if they were willing to tip, maybe they should have adjusted the amount instead of leaving 0%. So maybe the answer is A (Yes), they are in the wrong. Wait, but the bartender shouldn't have done that. Maybe the user isn't in the wrong because the bartender acted improperly first. Hmm. I'm a bit conflicted. The user's response was to not tip in protest, which might not be acceptable, but the bartender's action was the initial problem. So the user isn't entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
