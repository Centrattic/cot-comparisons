      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but noticed the tip being added, so they left 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in hospitality. Bartenders typically rely on tips as a significant part of their income. The norm is usually 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% is within the standard range. However, the person here didn't tip because the bartender added the 20% without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the bartender have the right to add a tip without permission? Is it the customer's responsibility to tip regardless? The person felt the bartender was taking advantage of their potential inebriation. However, typically, customers are expected to tip even if they're drunk. The bartender might not be required to explain the tip, but adding it without consent could be an issue.\n\nBut usually, the customer has the choice to tip or not. However, in some places, a \"service charge\" might be added automatically to cover tips, but in this case, it seems like the bartender added a personal tip. If the bartender is allowed to do that, maybe it's not appropriate. However, the person's response of leaving 0% and confronting the bartender could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nThe bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. That could be problematic because refusing service based on tipping might be against the law in some areas. However, the bartender might have the right to refuse service to anyone, regardless of reason, unless it's discriminatory.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might be at fault for not tipping when it's customary, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be an issue. However, the person's response of leaving 0% and confronting the bartender might be seen as wrong because they didn't tip even after the bartender's warning. The bartender's refusal to serve them might be legal but could be considered poor customer service.\n\nIn the end, the person's refusal to tip, despite the established norm, is likely the main issue here. They had the choice to tip or not, and the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might not be appropriate. However, the customer is expected to tip, so not doing so could be seen as wrong. However, the bartender's behavior of adding the tip without consent could also be a problem. But since the person didn't tip at all, they are likely in the wrong.\n"
