      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought them drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person, who was drunk but not too drunk, refused to tip and even told the bartender not to take advantage of people who are drunk. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is a common practice where servers, bartenders, etc., rely on it for a significant part of their income. However, the twist here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay at a venue, you have the option to tip, but the bartender here unilaterally added a 20% tip. That might be against the establishment's policy, as they usually don't auto-add tips unless there's a specific reason, like a tip jar or a system setup. \n\nThe customer noticed this and decided not to tip as a form of protest. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The customer's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't force them to tip, especially when they were under the influence. The question is whether the customer was wrong for not tipping.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, you can't force someone to tip. Tipping is a voluntary gesture. However, some states or establishments might have policies where a minimum tip is expected. If the bartender added the tip without permission, that might be against the rules. Also, threatening not to serve someone could be discriminatory or against service policies.\n\nEthically, the customer might feel wronged by the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent. Even if they were drunk, the bartender's threat to not serve them could be seen as overstepping. The customer's response of not tipping is a reaction to what they perceive as an unfair practice. However, the customer could have addressed the issue differently, like asking the manager or discussing it later when sober, rather than refusing to tip on the spot.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the bartender initiated a situation that led to conflict. The customer's refusal was a direct response to the bartender's action. The bartender's ultimatum might be unprofessional, as they can't refuse service based on a disagreement over tipping unless there's a specific policy. However, the customer did choose to engage in a confrontation, which could be seen as their fault for not handling the situation more calmly.\n\nFactors to consider: The bartender's right to add a tip. If the establishment allows it, then the customer's refusal is a personal choice. If not, the bartender overstepped. The customer's response to the situation\u2014whether it was appropriate. The bartender's threat to not serve, which could be against the establishment's policy. The customer's state of being drunk, which might affect their judgment but not necessarily their responsibility.\n\nIn many cases, tipping is expected, but it's not legally required. If the bartender added a tip without permission, the customer could have the right to remove it. However, the customer's reaction of not tipping and confronting the bartender might lead to conflict. The key here is whether the bartender's action was within the rules of the establishment. If the bar auto-adds tips, then the customer's refusal is their choice, but if it's against policy, the bartender is at fault.\n\nOverall, the customer might not be in the wrong if the bartender acted outside the establishment's policies. However, the customer's response could be seen as confrontational. But since the bartender initiated the conflict by adding the tip without consent and then threatening service, the customer might be justified in their actions. Therefore, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong), but there's some nuance depending on the establishment's policies.\n"
