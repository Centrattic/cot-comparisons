      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author went to a club with friends, invited four people to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author was willing to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected for service. However, the usual practice is for the customer to add the tip voluntarily when paying. If the bartender added the tip without asking, that might be against standard practices. Some places allow automatic gratuities, but usually, they inform customers in advance. If the bartender did this without notice, it's a problem.\n\nThe author was drunk but not incapacitated. They noticed the tip being added and chose to respond by not tipping. The bartender's response of refusing service is aggressive. Legally, can a bartender refuse service for not tipping? In most places, no. Refusing service without cause can be problematic, especially if the customer is not a threat or causing issues. The author was just not tipping, which is a personal choice, even if it goes against norms.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone's state (drunk) to add a tip. That's a valid concern. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might be seen as taking advantage. However, the author's response of not tipping at all could be seen as a form of protest. But in terms of standard expectations, even if the tip was added without consent, the customer could still choose to leave an appropriate amount, just not the 20% added. By tipping 0%, the author might be going against the norm, but they had a reason based on the bartender's actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the bartender added the tip without permission, the author isn't obligated to pay. The bartender's refusal to serve is the more questionable action. So the author isn't in the wrong for not tipping in this case. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
