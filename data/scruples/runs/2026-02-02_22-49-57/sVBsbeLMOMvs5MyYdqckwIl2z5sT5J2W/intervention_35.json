      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to \"4 drinks,\" which I need to clarify. Then, when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but noticed this and left a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped, and the person argues they wanted to tip appropriately but the automatic 20% was off-putting.\n\nFirst, understanding the context: \"4 drinks\" might mean each person had four drinks, or maybe four total. But the key point is splitting the bill. The bartender added a tip without asking, which is unusual. Normally, tips are left at the discretion of the customer. However, some places automatically add a service charge, usually for large parties or events, but maybe not for a small group at a club. The person was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but they were still conscious enough to notice the tip being added. They responded by not tipping, which led to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering tipping etiquette generally: in many places, tipping is expected, especially for service workers. If the bartender added a 20% tip without consent, that's against standard practice. Most places require transparency when adding a service charge. So the bartender's action might be the initial issue. The customer then decides to not tip, which could be seen as a justified response to the bartender's unauthorized action. However, by not tipping at all, the customer is withholding compensation that's typically expected, which might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they knew about standard tipping practices beforehand. The bartender's refusal to serve could be a business decision, but it's a bit of a standoff.\n\nThe person's argument is that they wanted to tip appropriately but were upset by the automatic 20%. Maybe they thought the service wasn't worth 20%, or that the bartender shouldn't assume their tipping amount. However, by not tipping at all, they're not giving any compensation, which might be harsh. The question is whether the customer is wrong for not tipping in this case.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the automatic tip a standard practice of the bar? If it's common there, maybe the customer should have been aware. If it's not standard, then the bartender is at fault. The customer's state of being drunk could affect their judgment, but they were still able to object. The bartender's response of refusing service might be a policy, but it's a bit of a conflict. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether the customer's actions were in the wrong. Since tipping is a social norm, not tipping could be seen as wrong, but if the bartender violated the norm by adding the tip without consent, maybe the customer is justified. However, the customer's response (0% tip) is still against the norm. So there's a conflict between two norms: the bartender adding a tip without asking vs. the customer not tipping. \n\nIn many cases, if a service charge is added, it's usually for a specific reason (like group events), so maybe the bartender was following a policy. If the customer didn't know about the policy, they might not be in the wrong for objecting. But if the customer's response was to tip 0%, that's a problem because they're not contributing anything. So the customer is in the wrong for not tipping at all, even if they had an issue with the automatic tip. They could have negotiated a lower tip instead. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
