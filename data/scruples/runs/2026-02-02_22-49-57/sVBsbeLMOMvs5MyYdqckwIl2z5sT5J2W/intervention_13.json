I invited them (4 people) to 4 drinks. When I was paying, the bartender himself put a 20% tip without telling me. Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is at fault for not tipping the bartender after the bartender automatically added a 20% tip. The user's reasoning is that the bartender didn't inform them and then got upset when they refused to tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected. However, the twist here is that the bartender added a 20% tip without the customer's knowledge. Legally, in some states, it's required to disclose any automatic gratuities, especially if they're being added without the customer's consent. So if the bartender didn't inform the customer, that might be on the bartender's part.\n\nThe customer was drunk but still coherent enough to notice the tip being added. The customer's reaction was to not tip anything, which could be seen as a justified response to the bartender's action. However, some might argue that the customer should have still tipped a reasonable amount, even if the bartender added 20% by mistake. \n\nAnother angle is the bartender's response. Threatening to not serve the customer if they don't tip could be seen as inappropriate. Bartenders rely on tips, but demanding a tip is against the law in many places. So the bartender's behavior might be at fault here.\n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong. They might be thinking that the bartender's initial action of adding a tip without consent is the issue, and the customer had the right to object. However, others might say that the customer should have still tipped, even if the bartender made a mistake. \n\nI need to weigh whether the customer's refusal is justified given the bartender's actions. If the tip was added without consent, the customer's refusal could be a valid reaction. Plus, the bartender's threat to not serve is problematic. So, the answer might lean towards the customer not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the bartender's possible violation of disclosure policies and their threat, the customer's refusal might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
