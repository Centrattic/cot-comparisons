      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is they went to a club with friends, paid for four drinks, and the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and responded by not tipping, leading to the bartender refusing to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry, it's customary to tip servers, including bartenders, as part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit of an issue because the customer might not have wanted to tip that much, especially if they were under the impression they were paying the total amount.\n\nThe person mentions they were drunk but not too drunk to notice the tip being added. They felt the bartender was taking advantage, which led them to refuse the tip. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. There's a power dynamic here; the bartender can't force someone to tip, but they can refuse service. However, adding a tip without consent could be problematic, especially if the customer objects.\n\nI think the customer's reaction is understandable. If someone adds a tip without asking, and the customer feels it's unfair, they have a right to adjust their own tip. The bartender's response of refusing service seems extreme. While tipping is expected, it's not legally required in all places, and the customer should have the autonomy to decide their own gratuity. However, the customer did end up not tipping at all, which might be seen as disrespectful in some contexts. But given the bartender's actions, the customer's refusal was a reaction to perceived deception.\n\nSo, considering the bartender added the tip without consent and the customer's response was to not tip, the blame might be shared. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the main issue was the bartender's action, the customer's refusal, while perhaps not ideal, might not be entirely their fault. So I'd lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
