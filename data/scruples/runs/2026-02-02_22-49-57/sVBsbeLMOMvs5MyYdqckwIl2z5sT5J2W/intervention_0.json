Now I was pretty drunk, but not enough to not notice him trying to put the tip percentage on his own. I responded by tipping him 0% telling him to not take advantage of people who are drunk. He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender after the bartender added a 20% tip without permission.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of them. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider etiquette. Normally, tipping is a customary practice for service, but the bartender shouldn't add a tip without the customer's knowledge. That seems like an overstep. The customer might feel it's an attempt to force a tip, which is ethically questionable. The customer's response of refusing to tip could be seen as standing up for themselves, especially if they felt coerced. \n\nHowever, the customer also didn't tip at all, which in some contexts might be seen as rude. But the key here is that the bartender added the tip without permission. The customer was willing to tip appropriately but was upset about the bartender's action. \n\nSo, is the customer at fault? If the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent, then the customer's response is justified. The bartender's refusal to serve might have been a bit harsh, but the customer's initial action of not tipping 0% could be seen as a reaction to the bartender's mistake. \n\nI think the main issue is the bartender's action, not the customer's. The customer had the right to decide how much to tip. Therefore, the customer isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
