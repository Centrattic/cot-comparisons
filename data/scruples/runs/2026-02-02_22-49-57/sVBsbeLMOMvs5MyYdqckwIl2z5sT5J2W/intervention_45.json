He responded by saying that he won't serve me anymore if I don't tip him. I was willing to tip an appropriate amount myself, but him just putting in a 20% tip without telling me rubbed me the wrong way.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, bought four drinks. The bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person, who was a bit drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then threatened not to serve them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for good service. If the bartender added the tip automatically, maybe that's a common practice there. But the key point is that the bartender didn't inform the customer. That could be an issue because the customer wasn't given a choice. However, the customer then decided to tip 0%, which might seem counterintuitive because they were upset about the automatic tip but then didn't leave any. \n\nThe customer's reaction is based on the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking. They felt it was taking advantage of their state (being drunk). The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. Is that a valid response? Bartenders often rely on tips, so not tipping could be seen as problematic. But the customer might have a point if the establishment's policy is to add a tip automatically without disclosing, which could be misleading.\n\nAlso, the customer was willing to leave an appropriate tip themselves. They just didn't want the bartender to add it without consent. The confusion might be in the assumption that the automatic tip is standard, but the customer's right to know is important. If the bartender was supposed to inform them, not doing so could be the error. The customer's refusal to tip in response might be a reaction to that perceived deception.\n\nBut from another angle, even if the tip was automatic, the customer could have still chosen to leave an extra tip. Not leaving any could be seen as not contributing to the bartender's income, especially if they were served. However, the customer's argument is about autonomy in tipping. The bartender's ultimatum to not serve if they don't tip might be against the policy, as some places require tipping, but the customer might have been within their rights to refuse, especially if they felt pressured.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the bartender's action of adding a tip without informing the customer could be the main issue here. The customer's response, while perhaps not generous, might be justified in their perception of being unfairly charged. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
