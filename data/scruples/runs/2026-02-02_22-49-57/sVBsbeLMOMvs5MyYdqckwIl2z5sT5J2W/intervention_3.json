      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed and responded by tipping 0%, which led to the bartender refusing to serve them. The author argues they were willing to tip but were upset about the bartender adding the tip unilaterally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers, but it's typically left up to the customer. Automatically adding a tip without the customer's consent might be problematic. The bartender's action could be seen as overstepping since tipping is a customer's discretionary choice. However, some establishments do add a service charge, especially for groups or events, which might be standard in their policy. But the key point is that the bartender didn't inform the customer before adding the 20%. That lack of communication could be the issue.\n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of inebriation that they couldn't notice the bartender's action. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of the situation. By not tipping, the author is standing by their decision to not be charged an automatic tip without consent. However, in some contexts, even if the tip is automatically added, customers might still leave a tip, but in this case, the author refused. The bartender's response of refusing to serve could be a policy if they don't accept zero tips, but that's a separate issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The bartender acted without informing them, which could be considered wrong. The author's response was to not tip, which is their right if they choose. However, the conflict arises from the bartender's refusal to serve. But the question is about the author's actions. Since the author wasn't forced to tip and the bartender's action was the initial issue, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
