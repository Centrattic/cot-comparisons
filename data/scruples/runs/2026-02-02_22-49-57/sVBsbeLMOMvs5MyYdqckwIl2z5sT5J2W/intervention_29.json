      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk, decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped him. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the usual tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is standard, often 15-20%. But the author didn't tip because the bartender added the tip without consent. That's a key point. The bartender added the tip unilaterally, which might not be common practice in all places. The author's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a protest against the bartender's action. \n\nBut wait, the author was drunk. Maybe their judgment was impaired, but they claim they weren't too drunk to notice the bartender's action. The bartender's response was to refuse service if they didn't tip. Is that appropriate? Bartenders usually rely on tips, so maybe the author is at fault for not tipping, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without consent could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the author invited friends, meaning they might have had a group expense. If they were splitting the bill, maybe the added tip wasn't discussed. The main conflict is about the bartender's action versus the author's response. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't assume the tip. The bartender, in turn, is standing his ground. \n\nI think the key here is whether it's acceptable for the bartender to add a tip without informing the customer. If that's against the establishment's policy, then the author's reaction is justified. However, if the bartender was just trying to help and it's a common practice there, the author's refusal might be seen as rude. But since the author was not too drunk to notice and respond, their choice was deliberate. \n\nThe question is about who is in the wrong. The author's action of not tipping after the bartender added it without asking could be seen as a valid stand against the bartender's initiative. Alternatively, the author is at fault for not tipping in the first place. But maybe the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without consent. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the bartender acted unilaterally. However, some might argue that the author should still tip regardless. But the situation is a bit of a conflict between customer and service provider. The bartender's refusal to serve is a strong reaction, which could be seen as aggressive. \n\nIn many places, tipping is a social norm, but the method of adding it without consent is questionable. The author's response was to reciprocate by not tipping, which is understandable. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
