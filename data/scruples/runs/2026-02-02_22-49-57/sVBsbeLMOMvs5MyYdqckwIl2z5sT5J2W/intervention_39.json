      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, paid the bill, and noticed the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author then decided to tip 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people, and the bartender refused to serve them. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to recall typical tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for good service. However, the key here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, tips are the customer's choice, even if sometimes added automatically by the system. If the system automatically adds a tip, the customer might have an option to adjust it, but if the bartender manually added it without consulting the customer, that could be an issue.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping, which led to a confrontation. The bartender then refused to serve them. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. \n\nFirst, was the bartender allowed to add a tip without the customer's knowledge? Typically, the customer should be aware of any automatic tips. If the bartender did this intentionally without informing, that's a problem. Second, the author's response of tipping 0% might be justified if they felt coerced. But in most cases, refusing to tip at all could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the service was good. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without permission might be the initial wrongdoing.\n\nIn some establishments, a service charge is added to large parties or for events, but that's usually communicated beforehand. Here, the bartender did it on his own, which isn't standard. The author's reaction, while perhaps confrontational, might be justified because they felt the tip was forced. The bartender's refusal to serve could be within their rights if the establishment has a policy requiring a minimum tip, but if the author is a customer, the bartender can't legally refuse service unless there's a policy in place. However, in practice, bartenders can choose not to serve someone if they feel disrespected.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the bartender's action was inappropriate. However, the author's zero tip could be seen as extreme. But considering the bartender's unauthorized action, the author's response might be understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
