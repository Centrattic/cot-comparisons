      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice, and they responded by not tipping at all, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the automatic tip, the person's reaction, and the bartender's response. Normally, tips are a way for servers to earn extra, and in many places, especially places like clubs or bars, tipping is customary. If the bartender added a 20% tip without informing the customer, that's a problem. The customer has a right to know what's being added to their bill. The person's response was to not tip at all, which could be seen as a tit-for-tat reaction. \n\nBut was the person drunk? They mention they were drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. So, maybe their judgment was impaired, but they still made a conscious decision. \n\nNow, whether the customer is in the wrong depends on context. If the bartender didn't inform them about the tip, the customer might feel it's unfair. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as extreme, especially if the person intended to tip a certain amount themselves. The bartender's refusal to serve them is also an issue, as it's a hostile response. \n\nIn many places, businesses can add a gratuity, but they usually disclose it. If the bartender did this without disclosure, the customer's anger is understandable. However, the customer's response of leaving zero tip might be seen as an overreaction. \n\nSo, the person's action was a response to the bartender's unauthorized tip. The bartender's behavior was inappropriate, but the customer's response might be seen as justified in some circles because they wanted to assert control. However, in terms of social norms, tipping is expected, and not tipping could be seen as wrong, regardless of the reason. \n\nTherefore, the answer might hinge on whether the bartender's actions were deceptive. If the customer was misled, their reaction is more understandable. But if the customer had the chance to adjust the tip but chose not to, that could be their fault. \n\nI think the person isn't entirely at fault. They were reacting to an unexpected, undisclosed tip, and the bartender's threat to refuse service was unprofessional. However, refusing to tip is still a breach of social norms. But given the context, maybe the bartender is more at fault. So the answer might be B, not the author's fault.\n"
