      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender.\n\nSo, the scenario: The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They then tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender responded by refusing to serve unless they tipped. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and part of the service workers' income. Bartenders rely on tips significantly. However, the situation here is that the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, when you pay with a card, sometimes the system might add a tip, but the customer should have the option to adjust it. However, the key point is whether the bartender had the authority to add a tip without the customer's knowledge.\n\nIf the bartender added a 20% tip without the customer's consent, that could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the customer was under the influence. The customer's reaction of not tipping in response might be their way of standing up against that. However, the customer is also not tipping, which could be seen as not acknowledging the service provided.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the bartender added a tip without asking, the customer still received service. Not tipping entirely might be harsh. However, the customer's argument is that the bartender shouldn't assume a tip. Some places allow for mandatory tips, but usually, they are clearly communicated. If it wasn't clear, the customer might have a point in rejecting it.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's response of not serving unless tipped is a bit problematic. It's not the bartender's place to withhold service over a tip dispute. However, the customer's refusal to tip at all could also be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they were intoxicated and perhaps not thinking clearly.\n\nThe customer might have been better served to question the tip amount at the time but still leave a reasonable tip. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without communication might have been the initial issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the bartender had the right to add the tip without consent, and whether the customer's response was proportional. If the bartender added the tip against the customer's wishes, the customer's refusal to tip in response isn't entirely their fault. However, completely not tipping could still be seen as inconsiderate. But given the bartender's behavior, the customer might have a valid grievance.\n"
