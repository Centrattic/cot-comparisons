      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is now asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nHmm. First, I need to think about tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. So not tipping could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. But here, the bartender added the tip without asking. That's an unusual situation. Normally, the customer inputs the tip amount themselves. If the bartender did that without permission, maybe that's an issue.\n\nSo the person was upset because the bartender assumed they would tip 20%. They responded by leaving 0%, which led to a confrontation. The person's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk, but they were aware of the tip and chose to not leave it. \n\nBut wait, even if the bartender added the tip without permission, the appropriate response might have been to correct the tip amount rather than leave none. Maybe the person could have adjusted it to a lower amount they were comfortable with. Leaving 0% might be excessive, especially if the bartender was trying to make it easier by adding a standard tip. \n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is problematic. Employees shouldn't be allowed to deny service based on tipping, but that's their policy. However, the customer might have been in the wrong for not tipping in the first place. \n\nSo, the person's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of them being drunk. But they were conscious enough to notice the tip and act. Maybe the bartender was just following a standard practice, but adding a tip without asking is odd. In some places, the establishment might add a service charge, but that's usually announced. \n\nIf the person felt the tip was unearned, they could have adjusted it. But leaving 0% could be seen as punishing the bartender for the bartender's actions. The person might have overreacted. But maybe the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip. \n\nI think there's some nuance here. The person might be in the wrong for not tipping, but the bartender also shouldn't have added the tip without asking. However, in terms of the question, it's about whether the author is in the wrong. Since they left 0% and confronted the bartender, that could be seen as inappropriate. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
