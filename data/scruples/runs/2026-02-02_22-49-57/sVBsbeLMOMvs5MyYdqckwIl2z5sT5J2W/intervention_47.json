      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice, so they decided to tip 0%, arguing that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of intoxicated patrons. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. Normally, customers are expected to leave a tip, usually around 15-20%, even if the service is good. So, if the bartender added 20% automatically, that's in line with standard practice. However, the author didn't know the tip was added, and they refused to pay it. \n\nWait, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when a tip is added automatically, it's still the customer's choice to accept or not, but the customer might not be aware. However, in most cases, even if the tip is added by the system, the total amount is still the customer's responsibility unless there's a misunderstanding. The author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. But the author was the one initiating the transaction, so even if they were drunk, the responsibility to pay (including customary tips) still falls on them. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't add the tip without their knowledge, especially when they're under the influence. However, in most places, tipping is expected, and refusing to tip can be seen as a breach of etiquette. The bartender's response of not serving them further is within their right, as they can set their own policies. The author might be in the wrong here because they didn't tip when it's customary, even if the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing was questionable. \n\nBut maybe the key is that the tip was added without the customer's knowledge. Normally, the system might auto-add a tip, but the customer can still adjust it. If the bartender manually added 20% without telling the customer, that could be an issue. However, in most cases, the customer is expected to pay the tip regardless. The author's refusal could be seen as a response to the bartender's actions, but they might still be in the wrong for not tipping. \n\nAlternatively, the author could argue that they were not informed and were drunk, so the bartender shouldn't exploit that. But the customary expectation is still in place. So, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender's actions were a bit shady. The answer would depend on the cultural norms and expectations around tipping. In many places, not tipping is considered rude and unethical. So, the author's action of 0% tip, despite the bartender's mistake, might still be wrong.\n"
