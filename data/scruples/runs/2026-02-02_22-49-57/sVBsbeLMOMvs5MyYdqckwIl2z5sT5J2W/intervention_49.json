      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author invited four friends for drinks, went to a club, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to leave a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around tipping in the US. Bartenders usually rely on tips as a significant part of their income, so not tipping is generally frowned upon. However, there's a twist here: the bartender added the tip without asking. Normally, servers add tips automatically, but if they don't inform the customer first, that could be an issue.\n\nThe author might feel that the bartender was taking advantage of their state (being drunk) to add a tip without consent. However, in most places, the server can add a tip automatically, especially in states where it's allowed. The author's response of leaving 0% might be seen as confrontational. The bartender's response of refusing service if they don't tip is also problematic because he can't deny service based on that. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge, that's not standard practice. The author might have a valid point in feeling manipulated. However, even if that's the case, the appropriate response might have been to discuss it calmly or not return, not to retaliate by not tipping. \n\nSo on one hand, the bartender's action might be at fault for adding the tip without consent. On the other, the author's response was to not tip, which could be seen as a tit-for-tat and not the best approach. \n\nBut considering that the author was drunk, maybe they were more sensitive. Also, the bartender's refusal to serve is a problem because it's against the policy of most establishments. So the author might not be entirely wrong. \n\nHmm, in the end, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the bartender's actions were questionable, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the author's response could have been better. But the main fault lies with the bartender for not disclosing the tip. So B.\n"
