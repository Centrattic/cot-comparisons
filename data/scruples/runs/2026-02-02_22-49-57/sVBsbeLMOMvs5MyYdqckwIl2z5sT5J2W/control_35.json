      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they went to a club with friends, invited four friends to four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but not enough to miss the bartender adding the tip. They then tipped 0%, told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender said he won't serve them anymore if they don't tip. The person is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, tipping customs. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service like bartending. The usual is 15-20%, so if the bartender added 20% automatically, maybe that's standard. However, the person is upset because the bartender didn't inform them before adding the tip. So they felt it was manipulative, especially since they were drunk. \n\nThe person's response was to tip 0%, which is zero. That's not typical. Normally, even if you're upset, you might tip a smaller amount or none, but in the US, leaving no tip at all is considered very poor. So the person left zero, arguing the bartender shouldn't take advantage. The bartender then threatened not to serve them. \n\nIs the person wrong? Well, tipping is a service charge, but it's also part of the bartender's income. If the bartender added a tip without permission, maybe that's not standard. But in some places, bartenders automatically add tips for groups or for certain services. However, the person's reaction was to leave zero, which is harsh. Even if they were upset, the appropriate response might be to tip a lower amount, like 10%, or talk to management if they felt the tip was added without consent. \n\nAlso, the person was drunk. Arguably, being drunk might impair judgment, but it's still their responsibility to check the bill. If they didn't notice the tip being added, they might not be at fault. But if they noticed and then left zero, that's a choice. The bartender's response of refusing service might be over the top, but the person's zero tip was a direct response. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, leaving zero tip is usually frowned upon. Even if the person had a reason, the right approach would be to address it politely. So, the person might be wrong for leaving zero, but the bartender might be wrong for adding the tip without consent. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of leaving no tip in response to the bartender adding it without asking might be seen as wrong, because the bartender is relying on tips for income. Even if the addition was unapproved, leaving zero is a harsh punishment. The person could have left a smaller amount or discussed it. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance where the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. However, the main issue is the zero tip. In most cases, leaving no tip is considered rude regardless of the reason. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
