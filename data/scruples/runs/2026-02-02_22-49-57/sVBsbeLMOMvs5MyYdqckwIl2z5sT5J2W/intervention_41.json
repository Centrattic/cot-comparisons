      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation involves a group of friends going to a club, the author inviting four friends to drinks. At the end, the bartender adds a 20% tip without informing the author. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, refused to tip and told the bartender not to take advantage of people. The bartender then threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. The author claims they were willing to tip appropriately but the bartender adding the tip without consent was the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and often expected as part of the service. Bartenders rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added a tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, the customer is aware of the tip amount they're adding, so if the bartender added it without asking, that might be problematic. The author's reaction is based on the bartender taking advantage of their possible intoxication. \n\nThe author was drunk but not to the point of not understanding what was happening. The bartender's action of automatically adding a tip could be seen as taking advantage if the customer is in a vulnerable state. However, the author's refusal to tip, even a normal amount, might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were part of a group. \n\nBut the main issue is the bartender's action. Automatically adding a tip without the customer's consent could be against the policy of the establishment. If that's the case, the bartender might be at fault here. The author's response, while perhaps abrupt, might be justified if they felt coerced. However, refusing to tip entirely, regardless of the bartender's actions, could still make the author look bad, as tipping is generally expected. \n\nAnother angle is the threat from the bartender. If the bartender refused service because of the tip, that might be a problem for the bartender's professionalism. But if the author wasn't willing to comply, even after being informed of the policy, then maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip is an issue, and the author's refusal to tip could be justified as a reaction to that. However, the author's decision to not tip at all, even an appropriate amount, might still be seen as inconsiderate. But since the bartender acted inappropriately, perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer might lean towards 'No' because the bartender's actions were wrong, but the author's response could be seen as justified. However, in some contexts, the author could be seen as inconsiderate for not tipping even after the initial mistake. But the main problem was the bartender's unauthorized action. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
