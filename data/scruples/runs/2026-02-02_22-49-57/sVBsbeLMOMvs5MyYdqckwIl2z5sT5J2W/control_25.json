      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went to a club with friends, invited four of them to drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author got mad, put 0% tip, and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the service industry like bartending, tipping is expected. If the bartender added a 20% tip automatically, that might be a common practice. But the key point here is that the author felt it was done without their consent. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So maybe they felt the bartender was being manipulative by adding the tip without informing them, which led to their reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's job depends on tips, and in some places, automatic gratuities are standard for large groups or events. If the club has a policy where they add a tip for groups, the author might not have been aware of that. However, the bartender didn't explain it, which could be an issue because transparency is important. The author's response of leaving 0% and being confrontational is problematic because they didn't negotiate or ask for the tip to be removed. Instead, they took a stand, which might have violated the usual expectations.\n\nThe author's argument is about the bartender taking advantage when the customer is drunk. While being drunk doesn't excuse bad service, the author's reaction of not tipping at all could be seen as a tit-for-tat response. The bartender then refused service, which might be his right if the establishment has a policy requiring tips. However, the initial act of adding the tip without explanation might have been the first issue here.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author's decision to leave no tip after the bartender added it by default is a conflict. If the bartender's action was part of the establishment's policy, then the author might not have had a choice. But if the policy wasn't communicated, the bartender shares some responsibility. The author could have asked to remove the tip instead of leaving none. Since the bartender then refused to serve them, it's a mutual issue. However, the author's act of not tipping, which is a direct financial hit to the bartender, might make them the asshole here. So, answer A (Yes) or B (No)?\n\nHmm. Maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle it diplomatically. Even if the bartender added the tip without asking, a better approach would have been to talk to the manager or ask to adjust it. Leaving 0% is a strong response that affects the bartender's income. So perhaps the answer is A.\n"
