      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the person who didn't tip their bartender is at fault. The user went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and ended up not tipping the bartender. The bartender added a 20% tip without asking, and the user, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to not tip in response. The bartender then refused to serve them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in service industries like bars and restaurants. The standard is usually 15-20%, so the bartender adding 20% might be following that norm. However, he did it without informing the customer. That's a bit of a problem because the customer should have the choice of how much to tip. \n\nThe user was drunk, but not to the point of not being aware. They noticed the bartender adding the tip themselves. The user's response was to not tip, which is a direct reaction. They felt the bartender was taking advantage of a drunk person. The bartender then refused service if the user didn't tip. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? The user's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. However, in many cases, servers are allowed to add a gratuity, especially if it's a group or if the establishment has a policy. Some places do automatically add a tip for large parties. But the user wasn't informed, which might be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the user chose to not tip, which is against the norm. But the user's action was a response to the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender's refusal to serve after that could be seen as a breach of service, but maybe the user has a point in standing up for their right to choose the tip amount.\n\nSo, considering that the bartender acted unilaterally and the user tried to correct that by not tipping, the user might not be in the wrong. However, the user could have handled it differently, like asking to adjust the tip. But the act of not tipping in response to an unauthorized addition could be justified as a stand against being forced into a tip. Therefore, the user might not be at fault.\n"
