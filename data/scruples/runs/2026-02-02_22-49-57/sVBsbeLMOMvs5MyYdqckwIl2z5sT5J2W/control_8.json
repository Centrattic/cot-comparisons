      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person went to a club with friends, bought them four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by not tipping at all, told the bartender not to take advantage, and the bartender refused to serve them. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service. Bartenders rely on tips, so not tipping can be seen as rude or unfair. But here, the twist is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That's unusual. Typically, customers decide their own tipping, and adding it without asking might be a problem. The person felt wronged because the bartender took initiative without asking, which led to a conflict.\n\nThe person was drunk, which might affect their judgment. But even if drunk, they chose to not tip in response. However, the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent could be the root issue. The person might have felt that the bartender was taking advantage by not disclosing. But then refusing to tip entirely might be overreacting. Maybe the person should have discussed the tip amount instead of zeroing it out.\n\nBut is the person in the wrong? If the bartender added a tip without permission, that's an issue. But when confronted, the person's response was to not tip at all. The bartender then refused service. The person's argument is that they wanted to tip an appropriate amount themselves. But not tipping at all, even in response, could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the initial action of the bartender was also problematic.\n\nSo, the person's mistake might be in not tipping at all, regardless of the bartender's action. But if the bartender was doing something that shouldn't be done (adding tip without consent), the person might have a point. However, the cultural expectation of tipping might still hold. So the person could be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender made a mistake first. Alternatively, the bartender's action was wrong, making the person's response a justified reaction, but still not the best course of action.\n\nI think the key here is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without asking. The person had the right to decide their own tip. But by not tipping at all, they might have overreacted. However, the bartender's refusal to serve them when the person tried to adjust the tip is also problematic. So maybe both parties have some faults, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author did not tip, and in many places tipping is expected, even if the bartender made a mistake, the author's action of not tipping could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
