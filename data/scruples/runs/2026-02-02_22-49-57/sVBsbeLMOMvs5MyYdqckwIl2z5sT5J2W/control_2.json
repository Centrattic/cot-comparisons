      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip the bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for four drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author got drunk but was still conscious enough to notice and then decided to tip 0%, saying not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author wanted to tip an appropriate amount but was upset about the bartender adding the tip without consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service workers like bartenders. The standard is usually around 15-20%, so 20% is within that range. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. That's a bit unusual because typically, the customer is expected to decide the tip amount, especially if they're splitting the check or paying individually. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They felt it was wrong for the bartender to assume they'd pay 20% without consent. The author's reaction was to leave 0%, which is not typical, but their reasoning was that the bartender was taking advantage. The bartender then threatened not to serve them, which is a bit of an issue because refusing service based on tip amounts can be problematic, depending on local laws and policies.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author didn't tip, which might be seen as poor etiquette. But on the other hand, the bartender didn't ask for permission to add the tip, which could be a breach of customer autonomy. The author's response was to not tip, which is a choice, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without informing might be the root of the conflict. \n\nI need to consider if the bartender's action was acceptable. Some places allow automatic gratuities for large groups or certain services, but in this case, it's a group of five (the author and four friends) ordering drinks. If the bartender added the tip without asking, that could be against the establishment's policy or the customer's expectations. The author's decision to not tip in response might be seen as a stand against the bartender's action, but not tipping is generally frowned upon regardless of the reason. \n\nThe other factor is the bartender's response of refusing service. That's a strong move and might be against the club's policies, especially if they can't discriminate against customers. However, the author's initial decision to not tip could still be considered rude regardless of the bartender's actions.\n\nSo, putting it together, the author chose not to tip in response to the bartender's unauthorized addition of a tip. While the bartender's action was questionable, the author's response of zero tipping is also against standard etiquette. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not tipping, even if the bartender acted inappropriately. The correct approach would have been to adjust the tip after the fact or address it politely, rather than leaving zero. So the answer is A.\n"
