      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The person got drunk but not too drunk to notice this, so they tipped 0% and told the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The person is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in restaurants and bars, usually around 15-20%. Bartenders rely on tips as part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without informing the customer. Normally, when you pay with a credit card, the system might allow you to add a tip, but the bartender shouldn't be changing the tip amount without the customer's knowledge. That seems like a problem because the customer should have control over their own payment.\n\nThe person was drunk but not too drunk to notice. So they were aware enough to object. They decided to leave 0% in response to the bartender's unauthorized addition. The bartender then refused service if they didn't tip. Refusing service could be an issue because if the customer didn't want to tip, the bartender can't force them, but he can refuse to serve. However, that might not be legally enforceable in all places, but that's a different angle.\n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, the person might have overreacted by tipping 0%, especially since the bartender's action was possibly a mistake. Maybe the bartender thought it was standard to add a tip, but the customer didn't agree. However, the customer could have pointed out the error and adjusted the tip themselves instead of leaving none. But the fact that the bartender added it without asking is a breach of trust. The customer has the right to decide their own tip amount. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer could have been more polite. Yelling or being confrontational might make it worse. But the situation is that the bartender took initiative without consent. So the customer's right to control their payment is important. However, not tipping at all is a strong reaction. Maybe a better approach would be to explain the misunderstanding and adjust the tip. But the customer felt disrespected, so their reaction is understandable. \n\nLegally, the bartender can't force a tip. If the customer objects, they can refuse. So in that sense, the customer isn't in the wrong. The bartender's refusal to serve might be their prerogative, but it's up to the establishment's policy. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the bartender's action was wrong by adding the tip without permission, and the customer's response, while perhaps impulsive, was a reaction to that. The customer isn't entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
