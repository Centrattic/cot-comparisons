      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by leaving a 0% tip, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them, and the author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard tipping norms. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries, and 15-20% is common. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. This could be seen as deceptive because the customer might not have agreed to that percentage. If the bartender is supposed to communicate the tip amount, adding it unilaterally without checking in with the customer could be problematic.\n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by refusing to tip, which the bartender took as a refusal to serve. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of someone who's drunk. That's a valid concern because being under the influence can impair judgment, and there's an ethical consideration here about taking advantage of someone's state.\n\nHowever, the author also has a responsibility to tip appropriately if they received service. The bartender's action of adding the tip without consent might have been wrong, but the author's response of leaving 0% could also be seen as a way to protest or teach a lesson. But in practice, refusing to tip at all, even in protest, might still be considered inconsiderate or against social norms, especially since the author did receive service.\n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's threat to not serve them could be an overreaction. If the customer felt the tip was added without their consent, they have the right to adjust it. But leaving 0% might have been too harsh. Maybe the author should have adjusted the tip to a lower percentage, like 10%, instead of 0%, which would still be a protest but not completely avoid tipping.\n\nAnother angle: in some places, it's against policy for servers to add tips without the customer's knowledge. If the bartender did that, he might be violating company rules. The author's response could be a reaction to that violation. However, the author's action of not tipping could still be seen as inconsiderate regardless of the bartender's mistake.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the bartender made a mistake by adding a tip without consent, but the author's response of 0% might be too extreme. The author could have adjusted the tip to a lower amount instead. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not tipping at all, but the bartender also acted inappropriately. However, in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be defended as a response to the bartender's mistake, but not entirely without fault.\n"
