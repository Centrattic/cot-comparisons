      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to a club with friends, bought 4 drinks, was already paying when the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but still noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author wanted to tip appropriately but was upset about the bartender adding the tip secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary and expected for service workers. However, it's usually the customer's choice, and some might argue that adding a tip without permission is against that norm. The author might feel that the bartender was being deceptive, which is why they refused to tip. \n\nBut then, the author's response of 0% might be seen as harsh. Even if the bartender made a mistake, a more typical response might be to adjust the tip to the correct amount rather than giving nothing. However, the author's justification was about not letting the bartender take advantage, which could be a valid point if the bartender intended to exploit the drunk customer. \n\nThe bartender's threat to not serve the customer is also questionable. If the customer is a paying customer and the service is complete, refusing service after the fact might be against the law in some places. But in a private business, they can set their own rules. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If tipping is expected, then refusing to tip entirely could be seen as rude. But if the bartender added the tip without permission, that's an issue. The author might have a point about autonomy in tipping. However, the act of not tipping at all, even if the bartender made a mistake, could be seen as the customer's overreaction. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have pointed out the mistake and adjusted the tip to the correct amount they intended to give. By giving 0%, they might have violated the social norm regardless of the bartender's error. \n\nIn some regions, automatic gratuities are added for large groups, but the author was only with four friends, which might not qualify. The bartender's action might be outside the usual practice, making the author's objection valid. \n\nConsidering all angles, it's a nuanced situation. The author's main issue was the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking, which they found manipulative. Their response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a direct reaction to that perceived manipulation. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), since the bartender's actions could be considered inappropriate. However, the refusal to tip at all is a strong stance. But given the context of the bartender's mistake, maybe the author's actions are justified.\n"
