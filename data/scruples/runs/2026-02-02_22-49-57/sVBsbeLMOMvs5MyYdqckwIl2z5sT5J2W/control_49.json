      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not tipping a bartender. The user went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling the user. The user, who was somewhat drunk but not completely, noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The usual is 15-20%, but it can be more in some cases. However, the user didn't tip because the bartender added the 20% without informing them. Wait, but in some places, automatic gratuities are applied, especially in groups or for large parties. Maybe the bartender was following a policy where if you're in a group, they add a tip. But the user didn't know about this policy and thought the bartender was taking advantage.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't add a tip without notification. The user then decided to tip 0% as a response. However, the bartender refused to serve them, which led to a confrontation. Now, the question is whether the user was wrong.\n\nStandard tipping norms usually have the customer decide the tip amount. If the bartender added a tip without asking, that might be against the customer's wishes. But if the policy is to add a tip for groups, then the bartender might be following a rule. However, if the bartender didn't inform the user, that could be an issue. The user might argue that they were being forced to pay more without their consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's refusal to serve if not tipped could be problematic. In some places, tipping is not mandatory, so the bartender can't legally refuse service solely because of a tip. But the user's action of zero-tipping in response to the automatic tip might be seen as a form of protest. \n\nThe user was drunk but not to the point of being unable to act. So, their decision wasn't entirely impaired. However, being drunk can cloud judgment. The user's response might be seen as taking a stand against automatic tips, which some might agree with, while others might think the user should have just tipped as usual.\n\nIn terms of the bartender's response, refusing to serve because of a tip could be seen as unethical, as the service should be provided regardless of tipping. However, the user might have overreacted by not tipping at all. The appropriate action might have been to question the automatic tip but still leave a reasonable amount.\n\nSo, the user's mistake was not tipping as a form of protest. Even if they disagree with the automatic tip, not tipping at all might be seen as unfair to the bartender who relies on tips. Alternatively, if the automatic tip was against the user's preferences, they could have discussed the policy or adjusted accordingly. But choosing to tip 0% as a response could be seen as wrong because it affects the bartender's income. \n\nOn the other hand, if the bartender added the tip without notice, the user might have a valid point in objecting. However, the appropriate action would be to either not add the tip or negotiate, but not to zero-tip. So, the user's action is inconsiderate, but maybe not entirely their fault if the policy wasn't clear.\n\nOverall, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, which affects the bartender's earnings, even if they had a reason. The bartender's refusal to serve is also questionable, but the user's choice to not tip is more directly their responsibility.\n"
