      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't tip their bartender is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four people to four drinks each. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and responded by tipping 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them anymore if they didn't tip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard for tipping. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is customary for good service. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. Normally, servers might add a tip automatically for large groups or toasts, but it's usually disclosed. If the bartender didn't mention adding the tip, that could be an issue. The customer felt it was unfair that the tip was added without consent, especially since they were already paying for multiple friends. \n\nThe customer's reaction was to leave 0%, which is below the standard, but their reasoning was to prevent the bartender from exploiting someone who might be vulnerable (being drunk). The bartender then refused service, which could be seen as a conflict of interest or a misunderstanding. \n\nNow, is the customer in the wrong? They didn't tip, but the context was that the bartender added a tip without informing them. The customer might have felt it was a manipulation tactic, especially given their state. However, the appropriate action would typically be to either correct the tip amount after realizing the mistake or to politely explain the situation. Refusing to tip entirely because of the automatic addition might be seen as harsh, but if the bartender didn't communicate properly, the customer has a point.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the bartender added a tip without disclosure, which is unprofessional. The customer, while perhaps not wrong in their response, could have handled it differently. But the main issue is the bartender's action. Therefore, the customer isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
