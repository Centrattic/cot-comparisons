      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The scenario is that they went to a club with friends, bought drinks for four people, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them further if they didn't tip. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the etiquette around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary for service industry workers. Bartenders typically rely on tips as a significant part of their income. However, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge or consent. Normally, the customer should have control over the tip amount, and adding it without informing them could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe author was drunk but not too drunk to notice the bartender's action. They responded by not tipping at all, which the bartender took as an insult, leading to a confrontation. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, refusing to tip entirely can be seen as rude or disrespectful, especially in industries where tipping is expected. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might have been the trigger. The author might feel they were being overcharged or manipulated. But even if the bartender did that, the appropriate response might have been to adjust the tip amount after the fact rather than refuse to tip entirely.\n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing service if they didn't tip could be a breach of service. But in some places, businesses can ask for tips or have policies about them, though they can't legally force customers to tip. However, the bartender's statement about not serving them might be a violation of the customer's right to choose, but the author still has the option to leave and pay elsewhere.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. But in standard practice, the customer is the one who decides the tip. The bartender's action might have been a mistake or a way to enforce their own expectation. The author's response, while perhaps impulsive due to being drunk, was to not tip at all, which might be seen as an overreaction but also a stand against perceived manipulation. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have argued for a lower tip or corrected the mistake politely. However, given the situation, the author might feel justified in their response. But refusing to tip in a place where it's customary could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on the customary tipping practices in the specific location and the bartender's actions. If the bartender added the tip without permission, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, refusing to tip entirely could be seen as their fault because they didn't handle it in a more constructive way. But since the bartender's action was the initial issue, the author's response might be understandable. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
