      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited four people for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without telling them. The author was drunk but noticed this and tipped 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunks. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The author didn't want to tip because they thought the bartender shouldn't add the tip without permission.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider standard tipping practices. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected in restaurants and bars. However, the key issue here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, the customer is supposed to decide the tip amount, right? So if the bartender unilaterally added 20% without asking, that might be problematic. The author, being drunk but not incapacitated, noticed this and decided to refuse the tip. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bartender was taking advantage of them being drunk. But wait, the author was the one who invited friends and presumably split the bill. Maybe the total was higher because of more people, but the bartender's action of adding a tip without consent seems like it's against the usual practice. \n\nThen, the bartender threatened not to serve them if they didn't tip. That seems like a possible violation of service policies. In many places, employees can't refuse service just because a customer doesn't tip, unless there's a specific policy. But if the establishment has a policy of automatic gratuities (like for large parties or events), that's different. However, the author mentions it was a club, which might not have such policies. \n\nSo the author's decision to not tip in response to the bartender's unauthorized addition could be seen as a justified reaction. The bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission, and the author was within their rights to refuse. However, the author's decision to tip 0% might be seen as confrontational, but considering the bartender's initial action, it's a form of pushing back. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation that even if someone is drunk, you should tip. But the author was not too drunk to notice the tip being added and to make a decision. The bartender's response of refusing service seems like overreacting. \n\nSo putting it all together: the bartender's actions started the problem by adding the tip without consent. The author's refusal to tip as a response might be justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
