      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the author invited four friends to drinks, went to a club, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author was drunk but still noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for service workers, often around 15-20%. However, it's usually the customer's responsibility to add the tip, unless the bill is split or there's a pre-agreed arrangement. Here, the bartender added the tip without the customer's knowledge. That seems odd. Typically, tips are left by the customer, not added automatically by the server, unless maybe in a specific establishment. The author might have felt that the bartender was taking initiative without permission, which could be seen as inappropriate, especially when the customer was drunk and might not realize.\n\nBut then, the author decided to tip 0% in response. That's where the conflict arises. The bartender refused to serve them, which is within his rights if the establishment's policy requires tipping. However, in many places, servers can't refuse service for not tipping, unless it's a private club or something. But the key point here is whether the author was obligated to tip in this scenario. If the bartender added the tip without permission, the author might have felt it was unfair to be forced to pay more. But the author's response of zeroing out the tip could be seen as a form of protest, which the bartender then used as a reason to refuse service. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. The author's reasoning is that the bartender shouldn't take advantage of their intoxicated state. But being drunk doesn't absolve someone from the social norm of tipping. However, the bartender's action of adding the tip without asking might have been the initial wrong. The author's response, while firm, could be seen as a way to correct an unfair practice. But in terms of legal or moral rightness, the author is in a gray area. If the bartender isn't allowed to add tips automatically, then the author might be right. But if tipping is expected and they chose not to, then they're in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the bartender's action was appropriate and whether the author's response was reasonable. Since the bartender didn't inform the customer, the author wasn't at fault for correcting that. But refusing to tip entirely might be seen as going too far. However, given the circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
