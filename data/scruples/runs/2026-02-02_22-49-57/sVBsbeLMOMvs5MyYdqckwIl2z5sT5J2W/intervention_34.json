      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to each have four drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The user, though drunk, noticed and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then refused to serve them unless they tipped.\n\nFirst, tipping customs can vary. In many places, especially in the US, a 15-20% tip is standard for good service. However, the bartender added the tip without asking, which is a bit odd. Normally, the server might suggest a tip, but automatically adding it without the customer's knowledge might be an issue. The user was upset because they didn't want to be taken advantage of, especially when they were drunk. \n\nThe user's response was to tip 0%, which could be seen as a protest. But is that fair? If the bartender had asked, maybe the user would have tipped a different amount. But since the bartender didn't ask, the user felt forced into a situation where they had to react. The bartender then escalated the situation by threatening not to serve them, which might be overreacting. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they didn't tip, which some might see as rude, but the bartender's action of adding the tip without permission first was problematic. The user's right to control their own tipping is important. However, refusing to tip entirely could still be considered inconsiderate, regardless of the bartender's mistake. But given the bartender's initial error, the user's reaction might be justified as a stand against being manipulated, even if it's not the typical way to handle it. \n\nI think the balance here is that the user isn't entirely wrong because the bartender shouldn't have assumed a tip without asking. However, the user's choice to tip 0% might still be seen as rude. But considering the bartender's actions, the user's response is more about standing up for themselves against an automatic added tip. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
