      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that the person went to a club with friends, invited four friends to drinks, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The person was drunk but noticed this and decided to tip 0%, telling the bartender not to take advantage of drunk people. The bartender then said he wouldn't serve them if they didn't tip. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around tipping. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is customary in service industries like bartending. The expectation is usually around 15-20%, but it's supposed to be the customer's choice. However, if the bartender automatically added the tip without informing the customer, that could be a problem. Normally, when a tip is added automatically, it's either because the restaurant has a policy or the customer requests it, but here the bartender did it on his own without communication.\n\nThe customer was drunk but not too drunk to notice. They responded by zeroing out the tip, which might be seen as a stand against the bartender's unauthorized action. The bartender's response was to refuse service unless they tipped. That seems like a power play, since the bartender can't legally refuse service for not tipping. Tipping is a customer's choice, and employees shouldn't coerce customers.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the customer being drunk. When someone is intoxicated, their judgment might be impaired, which could affect their decision to not tip. However, the main issue here is the bartender's unauthorized addition of the tip. The customer might be justified in refusing it since it wasn't their choice. However, the customer could have handled it differently, like asking to remove the tip and then deciding how much to tip themselves.\n\nSo, the bartender's actions were inappropriate by adding a tip without consent. The customer's response was a protest against that, but by not tipping at all, they might be going over the line. However, if the bartender was already adding their own tip, the customer's refusal could be a reaction to that. The key points are the bartender's unauthorized action and the customer's response. The customer wasn't in the wrong for refusing the non-consensual tip, but refusing to tip entirely might be seen as extreme. However, since the bartender was trying to force them to tip, the customer's stance could be justified as standing up for themselves. So, maybe the customer isn't entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
