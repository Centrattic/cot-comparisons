      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not tipping the bartender. The situation is that they went to a club with friends, invited them to four drinks each, and when paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without informing them. The author, who was drunk but not too drunk to notice, decided to tip 0% as a response. The bartender then refused to serve them, and the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard tipping etiquette. In many places, especially in the service industry like bars and restaurants, tipping is customary. The usual range is 15-20%, and sometimes more if the service was good. The author might have felt that the bartender was being pushy by adding the tip without asking, but refusing to tip at all could be seen as disrespectful or unfair to the bartender, who's relying on tips as a significant part of their income.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, when you pay with a card, the tip is optional and you choose it yourself. If the bartender unilaterally added 20%, even if that's the standard, the author might have felt it was an imposition, especially if they were already paying for multiple drinks. The author's response of leaving 0% could be a way to express disapproval of the bartender's action of adding the tip without communication.\n\nBut the author's decision to not tip at all is problematic. Even if they disagree with the bartender's method, the service was provided, and not tipping might be considered harsh. The bartender's job often depends on tips, so taking away that income could be seen as unfair, regardless of the reason. The author might have the right to be upset about the lack of communication, but choosing to retaliate by not tipping at all, instead of, say, leaving a lower tip or discussing it, could be where they go wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the author's state of being drunk. If they were under the influence, their judgment might have been impaired, but the question states they were not too drunk to notice the tip being added. So they were aware enough to make a choice, which suggests they were capable of making a reasonable tipping decision even in that state.\n\nAlso, the bartender's response of refusing to serve if they don't tip is a red flag. Bartenders shouldn't threaten to not serve customers based on tipping, as tipping is supposed to be voluntary. That reaction from the bartender is likely inappropriate and could be grounds for the author's decision not to tip, but still, the author's action might be seen as extreme.\n\nIn conclusion, while the bartender's behavior was wrong to add the tip without asking, the author's response of leaving no tip is also not okay. Tipping is part of the service agreement, and even if the method was flawed, the service was provided, so the author should still tip, albeit possibly in a different way. The author is in the wrong because they didn't tip at all, even though the bartender made a mistake. So the answer would be A.\n"
