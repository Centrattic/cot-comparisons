      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they went to a club with friends, invited four friends for drinks. When paying, the bartender added a 20% tip without asking. The author got upset, maybe because they were drunk, and tipped 0%, saying the bartender shouldn't take advantage. The bartender then refused to serve them if they didn't tip. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider tipping culture. In many places, especially in the US, tipping is expected for services like bartending. The standard is usually 15-20%. But wait, the bartender added the tip without telling them. That's a bit odd because typically, the customer controls the tip. Maybe the bartender assumed the customer would tip, so he just pre-added it. But the customer might have wanted to decide the tip amount themselves, especially since they were paying for multiple people. If the author didn't agree with the automatic tip, maybe they should have adjusted it. However, the author was drunk, so maybe they were more sensitive to being taken advantage of. \n\nOn the other hand, the bartender's job relies on tips. If the customer is responsible for paying for others, they might expect the tip to be included. The author's response of 0% could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a service industry where tips are part of the bartender's income. The bartender standing his ground by refusing to serve could be because he needs the tip, and if the customer isn't willing to give it, he's within his rights. \n\nBut the key point here is that the bartender added the tip without the customer's consent. Normally, the customer should set the tip amount. If the bartender pre-selected it without asking, that's against standard practice. So the author might have felt misled. However, the way the author responded by leaving a 0% tip and arguing might be aggressive. They could have asked the bartender to remove the tip or discussed it before paying. \n\nAlso, the author was drunk. That could impair judgment, but it's not an excuse for poor behavior. The bartender might have been doing his job by expecting a tip, but the method of adding it without communication was wrong. So the author's frustration is understandable, but their response was harsh. They might not be in the wrong entirely because the bartender shouldn't have assumed the tip. However, the author's action of not tipping at all is problematic because it denies the bartender part of his income, which is part of the service fee. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the bartender shouldn't have added the tip without permission. But the author could also be at fault for not handling it differently. However, since the bartender initiated the issue by adding the tip without consent, the author's reaction, while maybe abrupt, is a response to the bartender's mistake. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
