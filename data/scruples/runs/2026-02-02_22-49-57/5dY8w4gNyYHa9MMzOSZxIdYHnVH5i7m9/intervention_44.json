Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the setup: The couple moved in together, and they were splitting the rent. The girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the rent, which caused financial strain. The girlfriend's reasoning was that since she's with him, he should cover her expenses, even when she can't pay.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author believes in the traditional model where the guy pays most, but expects some reciprocity. The girlfriend, however, seems to expect the guy to cover all expenses without contributing when she can't. \n\nThe author is frustrated that after he covers her share, she isn't willing to help him with his own bills or debts. The breaking point was when she admitted it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. The author's reaction was cutting her off financially and ending the relationship.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, relationships often require mutual support, but there's a line when one person is consistently draining the other's resources. Financial dependence can be a problem if it's one-sided. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to handle her financial issues without reciprocation seems unhealthy. The author made a tough decision to prioritize his own financial stability, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, kicking someone out of an apartment can be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances\u2014especially if they were living together and the lease is under his name\u2014it might be his right to ask her to leave if she's not contributing. The test comment is problematic because testing someone's limits in a real-life situation is manipulative. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author set boundaries when he could no longer support her financially. While relationships should have support, they shouldn't be one-sided to the detriment of both. The girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to contribute beyond minimal cleaning and occasional payments led to the author's decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a difficult but necessary choice for his own well-being and financial health. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response is justified.\n"
