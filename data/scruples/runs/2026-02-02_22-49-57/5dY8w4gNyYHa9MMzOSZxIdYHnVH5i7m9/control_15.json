Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and she started not paying her share of the rent. He mentions that even before moving in together, she had a mindset where he should pay for most things, and she didn't contribute equally. Now, she's unable or unwilling to pay her share even after the move. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot, and she's not helping. He kicks her out because he feels it's unfair and unsustainable.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. Generally, when two people live together, splitting rent and bills is expected unless otherwise agreed. The author tried to split it initially but she couldn't pay. The girlfriend's argument that the guy should pay for everything seems to be a recurring problem. The author's frustration is about the imbalance. \n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement and communication. Did they have a clear agreement on financial responsibilities from the start? The author says he went along with her mindset against his better judgment. That suggests he might have compromised his own values. However, when she couldn't meet her end, he had a right to be upset. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocity is problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this imbalance might be seen as reasonable if he felt it was unfair. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out abruptly\u2014could be seen as harsh. But given the financial strain and her not contributing, maybe it's justified. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment that it was a test makes it seem like she was using the situation to see his reaction, which is manipulative. That would support the author's decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that relationships require compromise, and the author could have tried to find another solution, like adjusting the payment terms. But given the repeated issues and her not contributing, the author's breaking point seems valid. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
