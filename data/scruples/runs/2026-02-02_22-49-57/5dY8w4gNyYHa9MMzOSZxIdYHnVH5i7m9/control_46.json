Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The user wants to know if the author made the right decision or if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things, which he did. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but then she couldn't pay. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a financial bind. When he asked her to pay back or contribute, she didn't want to. He then kicked her out because he felt she wasn't contributing, and she called it a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, splitting costs when living together is usually expected. If both parties can't contribute, it's a problem. The author might feel he's carrying the financial burden, which can be unsustainable. However, the girlfriend's reasoning that she was testing his response might be problematic. Expecting someone to cover all expenses without reciprocation can be a red flag.\n\nBut also, relationships involve compromise. If the author knew her financial habits beforehand and still moved in together, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, when it comes to rent, which is a major expense, both should contribute. The author's decision to end things when she couldn't pay might be seen as standing up for his own financial well-being. On the other hand, if he didn't set clear boundaries earlier, that could be a point against him.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether he had communicated his expectations about splitting costs. If he didn't set those boundaries from the start, maybe he's at fault. But if he did and she still refused to contribute after agreeing to split, then he's in the right. The key points are communication and mutual agreement on financial responsibilities. Since the author mentions he was paying for most things before, maybe he didn't establish clear expectations. But when moving in together, splitting rent is standard, so not doing that without prior agreement might be on her. The fact that she called it a test shows she didn't take the responsibility seriously. So, the author might be justified in his actions.\n"
