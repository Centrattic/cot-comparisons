Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to evaluate the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. He supported his girlfriend financially in various ways, including rent and groceries. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent, but she stopped contributing due to her own financial issues. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough spot. The final straw was when she couldn't pay anything again and he kicked her out.\n\nI need to consider relationship norms and expectations. Typically, in a committed relationship, shared financial responsibilities are expected, especially when living together. However, the author might have agreed to a certain arrangement without clear boundaries. The girlfriend's reasoning that she's a burden because of her debts could be a personal issue, but expecting the partner to cover all expenses indefinitely isn't sustainable.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be a result of frustration and financial strain. He tried compromising by letting her pay a few hundred dollars, but she didn't follow through. When she couldn't pay at all again, he decided to end the relationship. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test for how he'd react to an accident scenario is a bit of a stretch, as financial struggles aren't the same as emergencies.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he set boundaries and when those were repeatedly broken, he took action to protect his own financial well-being. While it's harsh to kick someone out, the situation involved significant financial stress and lack of reciprocity. The author prioritized his own stability, which is understandable. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
