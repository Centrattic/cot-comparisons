Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is about financial responsibility in a relationship when the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were used to paying for most things, which he believes is the guy's role, but expects some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was part of the agreement. However, the girlfriend started not being able to pay, leading the author to cover the rent himself. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual agreement. The author felt it was unfair to bear the full financial burden, especially when he was already managing his own debts. The girlfriend's explanation of it being a \"test\" seems dismissive of the author's financial stress. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a common topic. While it's true that relationships require support, there's also an expectation of mutual contribution, especially in shared expenses like rent. The author's decision to end the relationship when the girlfriend couldn't meet her share might be seen as a reasonable boundary. However, whether it's the right call depends on the context of their discussions about financial responsibilities.\n\nThe girlfriend's lack of communication and the author's frustration over unbalanced contributions could justify his actions. But if they had agreed on a plan for when she couldn't pay, maybe the outcome would've been different. The author's reaction was a result of accumulated stress and broken agreements, so his decision to end things might be seen as a last resort. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He set a boundary when his partner couldn't meet their agreed-upon responsibilities. The girlfriend's test explanation doesn't hold weight in this context because financial responsibility in a shared living situation typically requires both parties to contribute. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
