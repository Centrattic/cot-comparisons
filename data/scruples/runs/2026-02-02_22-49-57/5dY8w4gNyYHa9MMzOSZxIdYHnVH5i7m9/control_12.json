Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend moved in together, initially splitting rent. She couldn't pay her share, leading to financial strain on him. He ended up paying full rent, which put him in a tough spot with his own bills and debts. When he confronted her, she responded with \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implying he should handle all her financial issues. He then kicked her out, and she later claimed it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and relationship dynamics here. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common point of contention. The key factors here are mutual agreement on financial expectations, communication, and fairness. \n\nThe author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. However, when it came to splitting the rent, she couldn't contribute, which led to him shouldering the entire burden. This seems like a significant imbalance. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle all her financial issues without any reciprocity is problematic. Her statement \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" suggests a lack of consideration for the author's financial well-being, which is not a healthy dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did pay for a lot initially, but the relationship's financial expectations changed when they moved in together. The expectation that both parties contribute to shared expenses is reasonable. The author's decision to end the relationship due to this financial strain can be seen as a response to an ongoing issue where his needs were not being met. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for an emergency scenario is a bit concerning. Using a partner's financial stability as a test without prior discussion is not fair and could be seen as manipulative. Emergencies should be addressed through mutual support, but expecting one partner to cover all costs indefinitely without any contribution is unrealistic.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, kicking someone out of an apartment without following proper procedures (like eviction notices, waiting periods, etc.) might be an issue. But the question here is about moral wrongdoing rather than legal. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions stem from being overwhelmed by financial responsibility and seeking a fair partnership. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her dismissive attitude about the author's financial struggles likely contributed to the breakup. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries when those boundaries were repeatedly crossed.\n"
