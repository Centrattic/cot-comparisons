Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over rent issues is in the wrong. The scenario is that the girlfriend couldn't pay her share of the rent, and the author kicked her out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author mentions that he was used to paying for most things, even before they moved in together. The girlfriend would sometimes pay for things and clean, but he felt it wasn't equal. Then, after moving in together, she couldn't pay rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. He broke up with her because she wasn't contributing financially, especially after she said she couldn't pay again and even implied that's why she has a boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering the cultural context, in some relationships, there's an expectation for the guy to pay for everything, but the author mentions he believes in some give and take. The problem here is that when they moved in together, splitting rent is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent for multiple months would strain the relationship. The author had to cover the rent, which affected his finances, leading to his decision to end the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification of it being a \"test\" seems dismissive of the author's financial struggles. The author's reaction\u2014kicking her out\u2014might seem harsh, but if the situation is unsustainable financially, it's a valid decision. \n\nLegally, if they were roommates, the author can't just kick her out without proper eviction procedures. But since it's a romantic breakup, it's more about their agreement. Emotionally, the author felt wronged because the financial burden was all on him, and the girlfriend wasn't contributing. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to handle everything might be the root issue.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to his partner's lack of financial contribution, which he found unfair. While his reaction might be seen as extreme, the underlying issue of financial responsibility in a relationship is a valid concern. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the expectations they had. If they had an agreement that he would cover her rent, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the expectation was mutual contribution, then her not paying led to the breakup, which makes sense. \n\nThe key points are mutual expectations and the impact on both parties' finances. The author's decision to end the relationship due to his partner's inability or unwillingness to contribute financially seems justified if that was a deal-breaker for him. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
