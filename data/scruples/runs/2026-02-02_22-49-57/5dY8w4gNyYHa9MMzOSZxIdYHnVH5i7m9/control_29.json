Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story did the right thing by breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out for not paying rent. I need to analyze the situation and decide if he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's outline the key points. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, initially splitting rent. She stopped paying her share because of her debts, and he ends up covering the full rent. He's in a financial struggle, and she's not contributing. He gets angry and tells her to leave. She later says it was a test to see how he'd handle a crisis. He's questioning if he overreacted.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's covering all the rent, which is a significant financial burden. He mentions that he's already in a precarious situation, and she's not contributing equally. He had a previous understanding where she would pay sometimes, but now she's not. He might feel like he's carrying the entire burden, which can lead to resentment and stress. Breaking up might be his way of protecting his financial stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reasoning is that she's in debt and can't pay. She might believe that the guy should handle all the expenses, as she's in a tough spot herself. She also mentions that the situation was a test to see how he'd react in an emergency. This could imply she was testing his commitment or support. \n\nBut wait, if someone is in a committed relationship and moving in together, sharing financial responsibilities is usually expected. If both parties can't meet their obligations, it's a problem. The author had a conversation where she said she couldn't pay, and he agreed to let her pay a few hundred but she didn't follow through. When he asks for repayment, she dismisses it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" That seems like she's not taking her part of the responsibility seriously. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be seen as a last resort after repeated issues. However, some might argue that he could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier or working out a plan together. But given her repeated refusal to contribute and the financial strain he's under, his actions might be justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's test comment is a red flag. She's treating the situation like an experiment, which is disrespectful and shows a lack of consideration for his financial struggles. That could be the final straw, as the author mentions. \n\nIn relationships, especially cohabiting ones, financial responsibilities are a big part of the partnership. If one person is consistently not contributing and the other is shouldering everything, it's a recipe for conflict. The author might feel that his needs were being neglected, leading to his decision to end the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to communicate and compromise, but she wasn't meeting her end. His financial well-being is important, and he had the right to set a boundary when it was clear she wouldn't contribute. The fact that she tested him adds to the justification of his actions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
