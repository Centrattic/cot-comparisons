Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking out his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in with him in June 2018 and for six months she didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She cleaned sometimes, but the author felt it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, they split rent initially, but she couldn't pay later. The author paid the full rent, which put him in financial trouble. When the next month came, she said she could pay a few hundred, but then changed her mind. The author got fed up and told her to leave, and she claimed it was a test. The author now is paying full rent alone, which is stressing him financially.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFrom the situation, the author tried to be generous, paying for most things, but the girlfriend didn't contribute equally. When they moved in together, splitting rent was expected, but she couldn't pay. The author paid, but then she continued to not contribute. The girlfriend's reasoning that the guy should pay for everything is problematic. The author set boundaries after being in a precarious financial situation. The girlfriend even admitted it was a test, which seems manipulative. \n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship is important. If one person is consistently not contributing and causing financial strain, it's reasonable to reassess the relationship. The author acted to protect his own financial stability, which is valid. The girlfriend's expectation that the partner should handle all financial burdens isn't healthy. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions were justified. He tried to be understanding but had limits. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
