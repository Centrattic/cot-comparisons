Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. They were in a relationship where he was used to paying for most things, and when they moved in together, she stopped contributing to the rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, she wasn't contributing fairly. Then, she couldn't pay her share of the rent, leading him to pay the full amount. After some back and forth, she decided she couldn't pay at all, and he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nSo, the main points are financial responsibility in a relationship and how to handle it when a partner can't contribute. In a cohabiting situation, splitting rent is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. If one person can't pay and the other is forced to cover it, that can create tension. The author is taking a stand to protect his finances, which might be understandable.\n\nBut wait, was there a prior agreement? The author says they initially split the rent for a couple of months. Then she couldn't pay. He paid the full rent, which put his own finances in jeopardy. When she couldn't pay again, he decided to kick her out. He's in a position where he's trying to manage his own debts and bills. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she's in a situation where she can't pay due to her own debts. She might be in financial trouble. The author's reaction was to end the relationship and remove her from his apartment. \n\nIs this fair? Well, in a relationship, partners are supposed to support each other, but there's a balance. If she's unable to contribute to shared expenses, even if the guy pays for most things, there's a limit. The author is protecting his own financial stability. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement that it was a test is problematic. Using a partner's finances as a test is not reasonable. It shows a lack of responsibility and respect. The author's frustration is justified. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. He's trying to manage his own financial health, which is important. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out abruptly\u2014might be harsh. But considering the circumstances, he's making a choice to take control of his situation. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a mutual thing in a relationship. If one person consistently can't contribute and it's causing financial strain, ending the relationship might be necessary. The author isn't at fault here. He's standing up for his own needs.\n"
