Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things. He agreed to pay for dinners, events, etc., but she didn't contribute equally. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after a while. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused him financial strain. He kicked her out because she wasn't contributing and was in denial about it. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, relationships often require financial cooperation. However, expecting one partner to cover all expenses, especially rent, when the other is in a position to contribute, might be unfair. The author tried to balance things but felt used when the girlfriend couldn't or wouldn't pay her share. He made a decision to end the relationship to protect his own financial stability.\n\nThe girlfriend's approach of not paying rent and treating it as a test might be seen as manipulative. The author's reaction, while harsh, could be justified if he felt his own financial health was being jeopardized. However, the way he handled the breakup\u2014kicking her out in a stressful time\u2014might be seen as abrupt. But given the circumstances, he might have felt it was necessary for self-preservation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's taking responsibility for his finances and setting boundaries. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and the test comment could support his decision. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
