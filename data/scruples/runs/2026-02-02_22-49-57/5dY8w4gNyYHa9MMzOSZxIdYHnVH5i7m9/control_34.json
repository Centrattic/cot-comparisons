Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together in 2018. She didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries for the first six months. He mentions she cleaned sometimes, but he felt the contributions weren't equal. Then, when they moved in together, they split the rent initially. But in February, she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. He paid the full rent, which put him in a financial bind. This happened again when she said she couldn't pay anything, and he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility and fairness. The author says he believed the guy should pay most, but there needs to be some give and take. He was contributing a lot before, but when they moved in together, she wasn't paying her share. When he confronted her, she didn't take responsibility and even said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which implies she expects him to cover her expenses. \n\nThe author's actions were to break up and make her leave. The question is whether that's justified. Legally, if she was a tenant and wasn't paying rent, he might have the right to ask her to leave, depending on the lease terms. But the ethical angle is more about their relationship dynamics. \n\nHe seems to have set boundaries initially, but maybe didn't communicate them clearly. She had the expectation that he would cover her, which he found unfair. When she couldn't pay and refused to take responsibility, he decided to end the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for a future emergency is problematic because financial responsibility isn't the same as an emergency. If she can't manage her own finances, expecting her partner to cover her debts isn't fair. \n\nThe author was in a precarious financial situation because of her not contributing. It's reasonable for him to prioritize his own financial stability. Her not contributing to shared expenses when able is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nSo, I think the author wasn't in the wrong because he set a boundary and followed through when those boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend didn't meet her responsibilities, and the author acted to protect his financial well-being.\n"
