Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that the girlfriend moved in, initially didn't pay rent for six months, and then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. The author ended up paying all the rent and then kicked her out after she couldn't contribute again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. The girlfriend didn't contribute much financially, even after moving in together. The author paid the rent when she couldn't, but then she couldn't help again, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent could be due to her financial situation, maybe she's in debt. However, entering a relationship where both parties are supposed to share living expenses, especially rent, is a common expectation. If one person can't contribute, it's a valid reason to reassess the relationship, especially if it's causing financial strain on the other.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did the author address the financial expectations early on? The author mentions they moved in together and split rent for a couple of months. If they had a clear agreement from the start about financial responsibilities, then the girlfriend's inability to meet her part might not be the author's fault. However, if the author didn't set clear boundaries, maybe they contributed more than they should have.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything, even though she helped sometimes, might indicate an imbalance. The author did try to help before, but when it became a financial burden, they decided to end it. The girlfriend's response that it was a test is problematic because that's not a valid reason to put someone in a difficult situation.\n\nOn the other hand, kicking someone out of a home is a serious action. If the author had a lease and the girlfriend was supposed to pay her share, not paying could be a breach of the lease agreement. However, in some jurisdictions, you can't just kick someone out without following legal procedures. If the author did that without proper notice or legal steps, they might be in the wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong morally or ethically. The author might feel justified if the financial strain was too much and the girlfriend wasn't contributing. However, the way they handled it (kicking her out) without considering alternatives, like moving out themselves or finding another arrangement, could be seen as harsh.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's financial situation might be due to circumstances beyond her control, like high debt. The author might have been too quick to judge without understanding her situation better. But the author also mentions that she had a mindset that the guy should pay everything, which is an issue.\n\nIn terms of financial responsibility in relationships, both parties should be able to contribute to shared expenses. If one can't, it's a problem. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this is understandable, but the method might be questionable if it was abrupt and without legal consideration.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship due to financial irresponsibility, but the way they handled the eviction might be problematic if it didn't follow proper procedures. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author had a valid reason related to financial strain and unequal contribution, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong. But if the eviction was illegal, that's a different matter. However, the question seems more about moral/ethical wrongness, so the answer is likely B.\n"
