Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he was paying for most things from the start, like dinners, events, groceries. The girlfriend would occasionally pay, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she started off splitting the rent but then stopped contributing due to her debts. The author ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual agreements in a relationship. In many relationships, splitting expenses is expected, especially when living together. The girlfriend's inability to contribute might not be her fault if she has debts, but the author felt he couldn't afford to cover everything alone. The author's reaction was to end the relationship, which could be seen as a personal decision based on his financial stress.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything might be a red flag. The author was against that mindset from the start but went along with it. When the financial burden became too much, he made a choice to end things. \n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. Legally, if the lease is under his name, he's responsible for the rent regardless. But emotionally, it's about fairness and communication. Did he communicate his expectations beforehand? It sounds like he might have, but the girlfriend didn't meet them. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation is a bit concerning. It might indicate manipulative behavior. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial strain. \n\nSo, the author made a tough decision based on his financial situation and the girlfriend's inability to meet her share. Since relationships require mutual support and effort, the author's actions might be justified as self-preservation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
