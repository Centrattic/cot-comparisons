Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend moved in together, split rent initially, but she stopped paying her share due to her debts. He ends up paying all the rent, which strains his finances. He confronts her, she says she can't pay, and he kicks her out. She later claims it was a test to see his reaction in a crisis. The author is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The user thinks the author is not at fault. Let me break it down.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a big deal. The author was paying most of the expenses, which wasn't balanced. When they moved in together, splitting rent is common, but if one partner can't contribute, it's a problem. The girlfriend's inability to pay her share, especially after previous patterns of not contributing equally, might have been a red flag. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship. Is that justified? Well, he's taking responsibility for his own financial stability. If she's consistently not contributing and he's in a position where he can't afford to support her, it's reasonable to set a boundary. However, there's the aspect of communication. Did he try to discuss the financial issues before the breakup? It seems he did, but she wasn't helpful. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay for everything could be an issue. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay most, but wanted some give and take. She wasn't providing that. When they moved in, she expected him to cover her bills. Her saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" when he asked for help suggests a lack of accountability. \n\nHer test explanation afterward seems like an excuse. If she was genuinely in debt, that's one thing, but using it as a test to see how he'd handle a crisis is manipulative. The author's reaction to her not contributing, especially after she tested him, might be justified. \n\nFinancial dependency in a relationship can be healthy if both parties are contributing or have a clear understanding. If one person is consistently a financial burden without reciprocity, it's a problem. The author is protecting his own financial health by ending the relationship. \n\nBut is it fair to kick her out immediately? Maybe he could have given her more time or found another solution. However, given that she had already not paid for months and showed no intention to start, his action might be the only way to enforce boundaries. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his financial responsibilities and setting a boundary when the relationship isn't balanced. The girlfriend's behavior was problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
