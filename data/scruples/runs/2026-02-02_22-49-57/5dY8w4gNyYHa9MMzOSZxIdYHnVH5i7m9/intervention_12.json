Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The story details their financial situation and the girlfriend's inability to contribute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he believed in the guy paying for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend moved in, initially split the rent, but then couldn't pay due to her debts. He paid the full rent, which put him in a tough spot, and now she can't pay again. He kicked her out, and she claimed it was a test.\n\nI should think about mutual responsibility in relationships. Financial contributions are a big part of living together. If one partner consistently can't meet their share, that's a problem. The author was covering everything, leading to his own financial strain. It's reasonable for him to expect some contribution, especially when they moved in together. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocating might be an issue.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response that it was a test seems dismissive. Testing how someone would react in a crisis might be seen as unfair if it's not a real emergency. The author felt wronged because his own financial issues were being ignored while he supported hers. Breaking up over this seems justified as he's prioritizing his own stability.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation angle. Some people might argue that in a relationship, partners help each other through tough times. However, the girlfriend's debts and inability to contribute were ongoing, and the author was already stretched thin. The key here is whether the author overreacted or if his actions were a reasonable response to unsustainable living arrangements.\n\nFinancial responsibilities are crucial in relationships, especially cohabitation. If one person is consistently not pulling their weight, it's reasonable for the other to reassess the situation. The author's decision to end the relationship when the girlfriend couldn't meet her financial obligations seems like a valid step to protect his own financial health.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He set boundaries, tried to work it out, and when it became unsustainable, he took action. The girlfriend's behavior contributed to the breakdown. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
