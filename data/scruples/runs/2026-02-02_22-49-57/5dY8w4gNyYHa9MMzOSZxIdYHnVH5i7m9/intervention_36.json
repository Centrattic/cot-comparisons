Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author, who's the guy, ended up paying all the rent, which caused him financial strain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was in a relationship where the guy paid for most things, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend couldn't contribute financially, leading to the breakup. The main question is whether the guy was wrong to kick her out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nLooking at relationship dynamics, financial responsibility is a big part. In many relationships, splitting costs is expected, especially when living together. The guy mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there needs to be give and take. The girlfriend wasn't contributing equally, especially with rent, which is a major expense. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I should consider if there's any expectation in a relationship that one person should cover all the costs. The girlfriend's argument that not paying rent was a test of the guy's character in a crisis situation seems weak. Real financial emergencies are different from ongoing inability to contribute. \n\nAlso, the guy had financial obligations himself and couldn't afford to be solely responsible for the rent. His decision to end the relationship when she couldn't meet her share seems reasonable. There's no indication he was abusive or unfair, just setting boundaries after repeated issues. \n\nSo, the guy's actions were about financial sustainability. He tried to split the rent but she couldn't pay, leading to his decision. The girlfriend's mindset of expecting the guy to pay everything without reciprocity is the core problem here. The author wasn't wrong to set a boundary when it affected his own finances.\n"
