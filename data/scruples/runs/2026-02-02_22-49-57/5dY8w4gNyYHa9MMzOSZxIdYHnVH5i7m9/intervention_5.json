Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author paid for most things during the relationship and later split the rent when they moved in together. The girlfriend couldn't pay her share, and the author eventually kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for everything, even though he tried to help. When they moved in together, she stopped contributing, leading to financial strain on the author. The girlfriend's justification was that she was testing how he'd handle tough situations, like an accident. But the author sees this as irresponsible and unfair.\n\nIn relationships, especially cohabiting ones, financial responsibilities are usually expected to be shared. If one partner can't contribute and it's causing significant stress, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. The author tried to compromise by splitting the rent initially but was let down. Kicking her out because she couldn't meet her financial obligations seems like a valid decision to protect his own financial well-being. The girlfriend's behavior seems to lack reciprocity and responsibility. The author didn't act without warning; there were prior issues, and he gave her chances. Her testing her partner's limits in a financial crisis isn't a good excuse. So, the author is justified in his actions. Answer B.\n"
