Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the author and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially, he paid for most things. When they moved in together, she stopped contributing to rent and other bills after a few months. The author tried to have her pay her share, but she couldn't due to her own financial issues. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. When she again couldn't pay, he asked her to leave. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis, but he found that excuse invalid.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points are financial responsibility and mutual contribution in a relationship. The author clearly communicated his expectations, but his girlfriend wasn't meeting her financial obligations. The author had to cover the rent in full, which he wasn't willing to continue. Breaking up over this seems reasonable because relationships require mutual support, and if one partner consistently takes without giving back, especially in significant areas like rent, it's a deal-breaker for many.\n\nThe girlfriend's excuse about it being a test doesn't hold water. Financial responsibility is a practical issue, not a hypothetical scenario. The author's actions were a direct response to her not fulfilling her part of the agreement, which is a legitimate reason to end the relationship. He's prioritizing his financial stability, which is important for his own well-being and future obligations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that relationships should involve more flexibility and support during tough times. However, the girlfriend's situation seems to be ongoing and not a temporary setback. The author had given her multiple chances to contribute, which she didn't take. So, the author isn't being unfair; he's setting a boundary for himself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting in his own interest when his partner isn't meeting basic responsibilities in the relationship.\n"
