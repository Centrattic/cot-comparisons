Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The situation's been going on since 2018, so there's a long history here.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend moved in in June 2018 and lived rent and bill-free for six months. Then, when they moved in together, they split the rent initially but she couldn't pay anymore. The author is paying full rent, which is causing them financial stress, and the girlfriend seems to think the boyfriend should always cover everything, even suggesting it's a test to see how he'd react in tough situations.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have a different view, not contributing financially beyond occasional payments and cleaning. The key points here are communication, expectations, and fairness. \n\nThe author might be right in feeling that their financial burden is unreasonable, especially if they had an agreement to split costs. If the girlfriend knew she couldn't meet her responsibilities and it's causing the author to struggle, then the author's decision to end the situation could be justified. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the boyfriend to handle all her financial issues without reciprocation is problematic. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction is also important. They kicked her out and ended the relationship. While the financial strain is real, the approach could have been handled differently if they were committed to working through it. But the girlfriend's lack of effort to contribute or communicate properly might have left the author no choice. The girlfriend's test explanation is a bit flimsy because financial situations can be unpredictable, but in this case, it's her recurring debt issues, not an unexpected accident.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the relationship's financial expectations were unbalanced, and the girlfriend wasn't meeting her agreed-upon responsibilities. The author made a tough decision, but it's understandable given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
