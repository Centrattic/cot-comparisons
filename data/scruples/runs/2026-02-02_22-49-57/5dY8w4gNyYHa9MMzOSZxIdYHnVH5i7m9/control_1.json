Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the guy kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They had been living together, splitting the rent initially, but she couldn't contribute anymore due to her own debts. The author is frustrated because he's shouldering all the financial burden now, and he ended things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship from the start. The user mentions that she's in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything, and even though he helped out with dinners, trips, etc., it wasn't equal. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent, leading to the breakup. \n\nThe user says he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, in their case, it seems like the give and take wasn't happening. The girl was paying very little, even when living with him before. When they moved in together, splitting rent was a mutual agreement, but she couldn't hold up her end. \n\nThe key point here is financial responsibility in a shared living situation. When two people live together, it's generally expected that they split expenses. If one person is consistently unable to contribute, it can create tension. The author was paying all the rent and other bills, which put him in a tough financial spot. He had to take on the full burden, which he couldn't afford long-term. \n\nHe broke up with her because she was unwilling to help with the rent, which he saw as a betrayal since he expected some sharing of costs. The girlfriend's reasoning that it was a test for how he'd handle her hypothetical emergencies seems like a cop-out. Real emergencies are different from ongoing financial neglect. \n\nI need to check if the author's actions were justified. He did give her chances to pay, asked her to repay him when she couldn't, and when she refused, he ended the relationship. It's about mutual responsibility. If both parties aren't contributing, the relationship becomes unequal. The author made the decision to end things when it became unsustainable, which is a responsible move. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated better or set clearer boundaries earlier. But he did mention trying to balance things from the start. The final straw was the consistent lack of contribution despite his own financial struggles. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own financial health and setting a boundary when things become unfair. The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the breakup was a necessary step. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
