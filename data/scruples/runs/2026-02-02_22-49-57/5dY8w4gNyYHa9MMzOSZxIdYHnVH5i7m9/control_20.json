Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the guy kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay the rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent. The girlfriend then couldn't pay her share due to her debts, and the guy paid the full rent. This happened again this month when she said she couldn't pay anything. The guy got angry and asked her to leave. The girlfriend later said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider responsibilities in a shared living situation. Typically, when two people live together, they should split the rent unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The guy mentions that they agreed to split the rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay. The author paid the full rent, which is understandable if they had a mutual agreement. But the issue is that the girlfriend didn't fulfill her part, and the author decided to end the relationship as a result.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of not paying rent could be seen as a breach of the agreement they made when moving in together. The author's reaction\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be a response to her failure to meet financial obligations. However, the line between standing up for oneself and being inconsiderate could be thin here. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that she was testing him adds another layer. If she was using this situation to test his reaction, that's a bit manipulative, but the author had every right to be upset about the financial strain. The author's frustration is valid because he's shouldering all the costs while the girlfriend isn't contributing, which is unfair to him.\n\nOn the other hand, ending a relationship solely based on financial issues might be a bit extreme. However, if the financial strain was causing significant stress and the girlfriend was unwilling to take responsibility, then the author's decision to break up could be seen as necessary. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship are a mutual thing. If one partner is consistently not pulling their weight, it's reasonable for the other to address it. The author's actions were a direct response to the girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to meet her financial obligations, which is a key part of any cohabitation arrangement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem justified. The girlfriend wasn't contributing her share, and the author took a stand. The final straw was her claiming she couldn't pay again without even offering to help, which is a significant issue. The author isn't in the wrong here because he's asserting his rights in a shared living situation where both parties should contribute.\n"
