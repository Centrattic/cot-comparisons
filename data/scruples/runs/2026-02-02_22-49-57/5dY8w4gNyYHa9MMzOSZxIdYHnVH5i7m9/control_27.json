Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup over the girlfriend not paying rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that he paid for most things during their relationship, and she occasionally paid for some things. They moved in together, split rent initially, but then she couldn't pay. He ends up paying full rent twice, and when she can't pay again, he kicks her out. He argues that he's in a bad financial spot because of this. She later says it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider societal norms and expectations. In many modern relationships, splitting expenses is common, but it can vary. The guy seems to have set up the situation where he paid most of the time, but when they moved in together, he expected her to contribute. She failed to do so, leading to his decision to end the relationship. \n\nIs he wrong for expecting her to pay her share? If the couple agreed to split the rent and she couldn't fulfill her part, then he had a right to address it. However, if he had been covering everything before, maybe he didn't set clear boundaries. But in this case, when they moved in together, splitting the rent equally is standard unless otherwise agreed. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach of not paying and seeing it as a test seems manipulative. The guy's reaction of ending the relationship because of financial dishonesty and lack of contribution might be justified. Financial compatibility is important in a relationship, and if one partner isn't meeting their financial obligations, it's a valid reason to end things. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the guy should have handled it differently, like setting clearer expectations from the start. But given the context, he did split the rent initially, and she took advantage of that. His breaking up over it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
