Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. They initially split the rent, but then she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. He ended up paying the full rent twice, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now he's telling her to leave because she's not contributing. She argues that she was testing his reaction, comparing it to an emergency scenario.\n\nSo, the key points are about financial responsibility in a relationship, expectations, and communication. The guy expected some give and take but felt she wasn't contributing equally. He had to cover her share, which caused him financial strain. She, on the other hand, claims she was testing his support in tough times.\n\nLegally and socially, when two people live together, it's usually expected they split expenses unless otherwise agreed. If there's an agreement to split rent and one person isn't contributing, the other is within their rights to ask them to leave if they can't meet their part. However, relationships can complicate this because there's an emotional aspect. The guy might have felt he was supporting her financially, but when it's unsustainable, he's justified in setting boundaries.\n\nBut was he in the wrong for breaking up and making her leave? Well, he did warn her, and she didn't follow through. If he had an agreement to split the rent and she didn't honor it, he's not wrong in enforcing the terms. However, the fact that he's the one paying everything might indicate an imbalanced dynamic. But given the situation, he's in a right to protect his own financial stability. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test seems manipulative. Testing someone's response by not paying rent when they can't afford it is risky and unfair. The guy's overreaction might be understandable given the stress and financial burden. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He had a legitimate reason to set boundaries when his partner wasn't meeting their financial responsibilities, especially when it's affecting his own well-being.\n"
