Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is the guy who ended the relationship, kicked her out, and now is wondering if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple moved in together, initially split the rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share. The guy ends up paying all the rent, leading to financial strain for himself. The girlfriend doesn't contribute, and when confronted, she says it's because she has her own debts. The guy feels it's unfair and breaks up. She later says it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, especially when living together, financial responsibilities are usually shared. The guy mentions he paid for most things, which the girlfriend didn't reciprocate. Moving in together, splitting rent is standard. When she can't pay, he ends up paying all, which puts him in a bad financial spot. He's justified in feeling upset because he's shouldering all the costs, especially if they agreed to split it. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything, even after moving in together, seems problematic. Her not contributing and then justifying it as a test might be a red flag. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did they discuss financial expectations beforehand? If the guy went along with her mindset that he should pay for everything, maybe he's partly responsible for not setting clear boundaries. However, when they moved in together, splitting rent is a basic agreement. Her inability to pay might be due to her financial situation, which could be a valid issue. But if she knew she wouldn't be able to contribute, maybe she shouldn't have agreed to move in. \n\nThe guy's actions might be seen as self-preservation. He's protecting his finances by ending the relationship. On the other hand, kicking her out after she's already moved in could be harsh. But given the circumstances, he's in a tough spot financially, and she's not helping. \n\nThe girlfriend's test comment is a bit concerning. If she used the relationship as a test for how he'd handle her problems, that's a big issue. It sounds like manipulation. The guy's overreaction might be due to her testing his limits, but he's reacting to her lack of contribution.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, financial responsibility in relationships is a two-way street. If both parties aren't contributing, it's a problem. The guy's decision to end things might be justified because he's in a better position to handle the financial burden, but maybe he could have handled it differently, like finding a compromise or setting clearer boundaries earlier. \n\nHowever, given the context, the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's the one taking a significant financial hit, and she's not pulling her weight. The main issue is the lack of equality in their financial contributions. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the guy is standing up for his own financial well-being, especially after she's already put him in a precarious position. The girlfriend's behavior is more questionable, using the relationship as a test. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
