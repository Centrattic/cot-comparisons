Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, initially splitting rent. The girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts, leading the author to pay the full rent. The girlfriend then couldn't pay the next month either, prompting the author to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual agreement on living arrangements. When two people move in together, especially if they're in a romantic relationship, it's usually expected that they share expenses. The girlfriend's inability to contribute, especially after the initial months, could be seen as a problem. The author mentions that he believed in the guy paying for most things but expected some give and take. However, the girlfriend's pattern of not contributing, even after agreeing to split the rent, led to the author's decision to end the relationship and her eviction.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that the author should help her financial issues because of their relationship might be a red flag. The author is responsible for his own financial stability, and if the girlfriend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. The final straw was her expecting the author to cover all expenses without reciprocation, which can strain the relationship.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author kicked her out, which can be seen as extreme, even if the financial issues are valid. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test for a hypothetical scenario like an accident complicates things. But in reality, the author can't be expected to bear all financial burdens indefinitely, especially if it affects his own stability.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations too. In some contexts, the man paying for everything is traditional, but mutual support doesn't mean one person should bear all financial responsibilities. The author's decision to end the relationship might be justified if the girlfriend wasn't meeting her end of the agreement. But evicting someone from a shared home can be harsh. However, if they were both on the lease, he might not have a legal issue, just a moral one.\n\nIn terms of morality, if the author had discussed the financial expectations upfront and the girlfriend still couldn't meet her share despite her ability to contribute, the author's actions might be understandable. The key is whether there was an agreement and if the girlfriend was aware of the expectations. Since the author mentions they split the rent for a couple of months, it's implied that she agreed to contribute. Her failure to do so after that is her problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he set boundaries and ended the relationship when those boundaries were not respected. The girlfriend's behavior was a choice, and the author had the right to protect his financial stability. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
