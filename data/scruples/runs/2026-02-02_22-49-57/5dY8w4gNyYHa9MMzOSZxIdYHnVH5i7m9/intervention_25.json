Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author breaking up with their girlfriend and asking her to leave their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The girlfriend moved in in June 2018 and lived rent-free for six months. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but she stopped contributing. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend's reasoning was that she had debts and bills, and she even said it was a test to see how the author would react in a crisis.\n\nThe author's main points are about financial responsibility and fairness. They mention that they believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend's lack of contribution, especially when the author was already struggling, seems to be the breaking point. The author decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave because they couldn't sustain the financial burden alone.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations. In many relationships, especially cohabiting ones, splitting rent is common. The girlfriend's inability or refusal to contribute, despite the author's efforts to support her financially, could be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after paying full rent for months and facing their own financial challenges.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification that it was a test for emergencies (like an accident) is a bit concerning. Using a real financial crisis as a hypothetical test might be manipulative. The author's decision to end the relationship seems like a reasonable response to a situation where their needs weren't being met, and they couldn't afford to support the relationship anymore.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author did give the girlfriend multiple chances, even when she contributed minimally. The initial part where the author paid for most things might have set an expectation that the author would always cover costs. But when it came to living together, expecting some contribution is standard. The girlfriend's failure to meet that basic expectation, especially when it caused financial strain, likely tipped the scales in the author's favor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to be accommodating but had limits, and those limits were crossed. The girlfriend's behavior was financially irresponsible and exploitative. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
