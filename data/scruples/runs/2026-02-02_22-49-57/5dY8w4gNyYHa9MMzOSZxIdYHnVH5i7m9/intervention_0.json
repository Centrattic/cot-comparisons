Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that he was paying for most things during the relationship, which he thought was normal, but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, she initially contributed but then stopped. The key point is when she couldn't pay rent, leading to the breakup.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, splitting rent when living together is typical, so not contributing could be a problem. The author tried to compromise, but she couldn't meet her end. The girlfriend's reasoning that she's there to help him financially seems unrealistic. The author's decision to end the relationship when she refuses to contribute might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have addressed the issue earlier with communication rather than sudden eviction. But given the context of repeated failures to pay, the author's frustration is understandable. The girlfriend's \"test\" argument doesn't sound valid; using personal financial struggles as a test is not fair.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual effort. If one partner consistently doesn't meet their responsibilities, it's reasonable to reassess. The author acted to protect his financial stability, which is important. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
