Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple moved in together in June 2018, and initially, she didn't pay rent or bills. He covered most costs, feeling it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they split rent at first, but she stopped paying due to her debts. He ends up paying the full rent, which strains his finances. When he asks for repayment, she refuses, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author believed in the guy paying most but not all, expecting some contribution. His girlfriend wasn't contributing, which led to financial strain. The user is asking if his reaction was justified.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. The author tried to communicate his concerns but felt ignored. Financial expectations should be discussed upfront. If the girlfriend couldn't meet her share, that's a valid reason for conflict. However, the act of kicking someone out of a shared home can be harsh. It's important to consider if there were other options, like legal processes or moving out himself.\n\nBut given the context, the author is in a financial bind due to her inability to contribute. Relationships require mutual support, but it's also about balance. If one person consistently takes without giving, it's reasonable to reassess. The girlfriend's attitude (like calling it a test) might indicate a lack of consideration for his situation.\n\nSo, while the author's actions might be seen as harsh, the underlying issue of financial responsibility and unequal contribution justifies his decision. He's protecting his own financial stability, which is a valid concern in a relationship. Therefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
