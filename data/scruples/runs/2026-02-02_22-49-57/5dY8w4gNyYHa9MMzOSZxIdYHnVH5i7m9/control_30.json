Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user's girlfriend moved into their apartment in June 2018, and for six months she didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She helped with cleaning sometimes, but the user felt it wasn't equal. Then they moved in together and agreed to split the rent, but she stopped paying after a few months because of her debts. The user ended up paying the full rent, which put them in a financial crunch. When asked to pay back, the girlfriend said she couldn't and even implied that having a boyfriend is why the user should help. The user then kicked her out, and she later said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations.\n\nFirst, I should consider the financial expectations in a relationship. The user mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, the girlfriend was not contributing financially at all after moving in. The user was covering all the expenses, which might be a point of contention. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be a gray area. If both partners are living together, it's common to split expenses, especially if they're in a committed relationship. The user paid full rent again after she couldn't pay, which caused them financial strain. The girlfriend's response that it's part of being in a relationship seems dismissive of the user's financial struggles. \n\nThe user's reaction was to kick her out, which might be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances where she wasn't contributing and the financial burden was all on him, maybe it's understandable. However, breaking up and evicting someone abruptly might not be the best approach. Maybe communication or setting clearer boundaries earlier could have helped. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for an emergency situation is a bit of a red flag. Using someone's financial stability as a test in a real-life situation seems manipulative. The user might not have overreacted because the financial strain was significant, and the girlfriend's behavior was irresponsible. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have addressed the issue earlier instead of waiting until they couldn't handle it. But considering the timeline, they tried to communicate and set conditions for repayment, which were ignored. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both are in a shared living situation, contributing to rent is expected. The user's actions might be justified because they couldn't sustain the financial burden alone. However, the way they handled the breakup could be criticized as harsh, but given the context, it might be a necessary step for their own well-being. \n\nSo, putting this together, the user isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were financially irresponsible, and the user had the right to set boundaries to protect their own financial stability. The answer should be B (No).\n"
