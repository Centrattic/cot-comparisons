Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. From the situation described, the author mentions that he paid for most things from the start, and the girlfriend didn't contribute equally. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent and expects him to cover everything, which he feels is unfair.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contributions. The author tried to split the rent initially but when the girlfriend couldn't pay, he covered it, leading to his own financial strain. He set boundaries and when she couldn't meet them, he decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave. \n\nThe girlfriend's justification that it was a \"test\" to see how he'd react in a tough situation (like an accident) seems a bit off. Comparing financial inability to an emergency isn't fair. The author's main issue is about shared responsibilities and fairness. He's clearly communicated his needs and boundaries, and when those aren't respected, he took action to protect his own financial stability.\n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, splitting costs is a common arrangement. If one person consistently can't contribute, it can create an imbalance. The author's decision to end things might be harsh, but given the context of ongoing financial strain and lack of reciprocity, it seems justified. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
