Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for everything. He agreed to pay for most things, but felt it wasn't equal. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying her share of the rent after a while. He paid the full rent, which put him in a financial bind. The final straw was when she couldn't pay again and justified it by saying why have a boyfriend if he doesn't support her financially. The author then kicked her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test for an emergency scenario.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The user believed in the guy paying more, but there should be some give and take. When the girlfriend moved in, she didn't contribute as expected. The author tried to split the rent but then she stopped. He ended up paying everything, which caused him financial stress. The breakup happened because he couldn't handle the financial burden anymore.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. In a relationship, especially when living together, splitting costs is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The author tried to split it initially, which is fair. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent due to her own debts might be a personal issue, but expecting the partner to cover it without contributing could be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when it affects his own financial stability.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning for it being a test for emergencies is a bit concerning. Financial support in emergencies is different from routine expenses. If she couldn't handle her debts, maybe she should have addressed that before relying on her partner. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a way to prioritize his own financial health, which is important for both parties' well-being.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries or seeking a solution together instead of just kicking her out. But given the repeated issues and the financial strain, his actions might be justified. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her justification could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nIn summary, the author's decision to break up seems reasonable given the circumstances. The girlfriend's expectation that he should cover all expenses without reciprocating is problematic. The author prioritized his own financial stability, which is a valid reason to end the relationship. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
