Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and asking his girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, including rent after they moved in together. The guy paid more than his share, and when the girlfriend couldn't contribute, he kicked her out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The guy mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things but there needs to be some give and take. The girlfriend moved in and didn't pay rent for six months, then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. He paid the full rent, which strained his finances. When she again couldn't pay, he decided to end the relationship.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, splitting rent is a common arrangement when two people live together. If both are contributing, it helps with expenses. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent, especially after he's already had to cover it, might be seen as a breach of that mutual agreement. The author's frustration is understandable because he's shouldering the financial burden alone. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocation could be problematic. The user says she did some cleaning, but it wasn't equal. If the financial expectations aren't aligned from the start, conflicts can arise. The boyfriend's decision to end the relationship when he felt the balance was off might be a personal choice based on his values. \n\nThe girlfriend's test mentioned (to see how he'd react in tough situations) seems like a red flag. Using someone's financial stability as a test in a relationship can be manipulative. The author's overreaction might be considered if he had other options, like discussing the situation further or finding a compromise. However, given the repeated issues and her unwillingness to contribute, his decision might be justified.\n\nLegally, if they're in a lease agreement, the responsibility of rent is usually split unless otherwise stated. If the girlfriend is on the lease, she's responsible to pay her share. The author might be within his rights to enforce that. Emotionally, it's a tough call, but the author's actions stem from a place of needing fairness. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue seems to be the girlfriend's expectations and her lack of contribution. The author had to make a hard decision to protect his financial stability, which is valid. So the answer should be B.\n"
