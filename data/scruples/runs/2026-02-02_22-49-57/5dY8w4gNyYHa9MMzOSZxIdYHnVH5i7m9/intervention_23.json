Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. The person in the post explains that the relationship had financial imbalances from the start. The girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, and even though he contributed more, she didn't reciprocate equally. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. Generally, when two people move in together, there's an expectation to split costs equally unless they agree otherwise. The girlfriend's refusal to pay rent despite being asked is a significant issue. The author mentions that she even considered it a test of how he'd react in tough situations, which is pretty dismissive and shows a lack of consideration for his financial struggles.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Did they have an agreement about splitting rent? The author states they initially split it but she stopped contributing. If there was no prior agreement about covering her rent if she couldn't pay, then her actions are problematic. The author had to choose between his financial stability and covering her rent, which he decided against. That seems reasonable, especially since he's already been covering most expenses.\n\nHowever, some might argue that breaking up over unpaid rent is harsh. But given the pattern of behavior and the stress it caused, the author's decision to end the relationship because of this financial burden is understandable. The girlfriend's attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") is particularly disrespectful and shows a lack of responsibility. \n\nFinancial compatibility is crucial in a relationship. If one partner consistently takes more than they give without acknowledging it, it can lead to resentment. The author acted after being let down multiple times, which might be seen as standing up for his own financial health. \n\nIn summary, while relationships are complex, the girlfriend's refusal to contribute financially and the author's need to prioritize his own situation don't make him in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
