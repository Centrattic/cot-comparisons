Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, he paid for most things, and she only occasionally contributed. He believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. Then she moved in, and for six months she didn't pay rent or bills, just cleaned a bit. Then when they moved in together, they split rent initially, but she couldn't pay her share. He paid the full rent, and now she's not paying again. He kicks her out because he's worried about his own finances. She later says it was a test to see his reaction to a tough situation.\n\nSo, the key points here: financial responsibility in a relationship, communication issues, and whether the author's actions were justified. Financial contributions in a relationship can be a sensitive topic. While it's common for one partner to contribute more, there's an expectation of mutual support. The author did pay for a lot initially, but when they moved in together, it's standard to split expenses. The girlfriend's inability to meet her financial obligations might be a valid reason for the author to reevaluate the relationship, especially if it's causing financial strain.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything could be problematic. However, the author also didn't set clear boundaries early on. Maybe he should have communicated more about financial expectations from the start. When she moved in and didn't pay rent for six months, that's a red flag. But when he tried to address it, she reacted by leaving for a week and not following through on paying her share. His decision to kick her out because of her not contributing might be seen as self-preservation, especially if he's struggling financially.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test is concerning. It suggests she might be manipulating the situation, which the author might not have realized. However, the author's reaction of getting angry and kicking her out could be seen as harsh if there was no prior discussion about financial responsibilities. Did he give her enough time to adjust or seek help with her debts? Maybe he should have explored alternatives, like a payment plan or financial counseling, before deciding to end the relationship.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if they were in a lease together, both are responsible for the rent regardless of the relationship status. If she's not paying, he could face legal issues if the landlord comes after him for the full amount. But that's more about legal responsibility than moral or emotional.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Financial contributions in a relationship are important, and if one partner is consistently not contributing, it can strain the relationship. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately after she couldn't pay\u2014might be seen as extreme if there was no prior discussion or attempts to resolve the issue together. On the other hand, he's protecting his own financial stability, which is understandable.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), given that financial responsibility is a valid concern and the girlfriend's behavior was problematic. But there's a nuance in how the situation was handled. However, the final decision to break up might be justified given her lack of contribution and the financial strain it caused him.\n"
