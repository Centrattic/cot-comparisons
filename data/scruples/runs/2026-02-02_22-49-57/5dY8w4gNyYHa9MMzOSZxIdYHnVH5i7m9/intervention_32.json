Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a girlfriend who moved in with him. Initially, he paid for most things, and she sometimes contributed, like cleaning and paying occasionally. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. But then she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts, and this happened again the next month. The author paid the full rent both times, which put him in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend's reasoning was that since she has a boyfriend, he should handle her financial issues. The author then kicked her out, and she claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author was in a relationship where financial responsibilities were unequal. The girlfriend expected the author to cover her bills, which he did, but it became unsustainable. When she couldn't pay rent, he had to cover it, leading to his own financial strain. The key points are mutual expectations, communication, and fairness. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for couples to discuss finances upfront. If the author agreed to split rent but the girlfriend couldn't meet her part, that's a problem. However, the author might have set boundaries, but maybe he didn't communicate them clearly. The girlfriend's attitude that the partner should handle her debts could be problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as him prioritizing his own financial stability, which is reasonable. However, kicking her out suddenly might be seen as harsh. \n\nBut in the post, the author mentions that he gave her chances to pay, and when she couldn't, he took action. The girlfriend's justification as a \"test\" is questionable. The author might feel that her expectation to support her financially without reciprocation was unfair. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a result of unmet expectations and financial strain. He tried to work with her but eventually had to set a boundary. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he had the right to expect financial partnership. If the relationship was based on him paying everything, then maybe he's not wrong to leave when that's unsustainable. However, if the breakup was abrupt without proper communication, that could be an issue. But the post suggests he tried to discuss it and she wasn't cooperative. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He was trying to maintain a partnership but when the balance was tipped too far, he had to act. The girlfriend's attitude was the main problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
