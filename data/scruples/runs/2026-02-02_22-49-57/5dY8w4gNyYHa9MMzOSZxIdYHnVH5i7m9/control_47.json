Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author describes a situation where his girlfriend couldn't pay rent because of her debts. He mentions that from the start, he was the one paying for most things, including rent, groceries, etc. She would occasionally pay for something and help with cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but she later couldn't pay. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now, she's not paying at all, and he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, but he feels he's overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider relationship norms, financial expectations, and whether the author acted appropriately.\n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, splitting costs is common. However, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Some couples choose to split everything equally, while others have different arrangements. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay most things but expected some give and take. However, when they moved in together, they did split the rent initially. When she couldn't pay, he covered it, but she didn't follow through afterward.\n\nThe author's frustration is justified if he felt the arrangement was supposed to be shared. When she continued to not contribute, especially after he had to take on her share, it's reasonable for him to feel that he's shouldering the burden. Her claiming it was a test is problematic because that's not a valid reason to expect someone else to cover your financial issues. Testing someone in this way is manipulative and unfair.\n\nHowever, the line between supporting a partner and enabling them is important. If he had the means to support her without putting himself in financial trouble, maybe there's a different perspective. But since he's now struggling, it's understandable that he wants her to contribute. Kicking her out when she's not meeting her financial obligations could be seen as a necessary step for his own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other through tough times. But that support should be mutual. If one partner is consistently taking without giving back, it's not balanced. The author made it clear that he expected some give and take, which wasn't happening. His decision to end the relationship under these circumstances seems justified, especially since communication failed and her actions were dismissive.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He set boundaries, tried to accommodate, but ultimately had to prioritize his finances when those boundaries were repeatedly crossed. Her behavior was irresponsible, and his reaction was a response to her not respecting their agreed-upon responsibilities.\n"
