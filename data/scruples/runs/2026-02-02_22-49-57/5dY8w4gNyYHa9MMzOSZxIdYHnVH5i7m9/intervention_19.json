Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author ended things because his girlfriend couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions that he paid for most things, which he believed was his role as the guy, but there was a lack of balance. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent, but she stopped contributing due to her own financial issues. He ended up covering the rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. She then expected him to continue covering everything, even after he asked for repayment. The author kicked her out when she couldn't pay, and she later suggested it was a test.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, relationships often involve shared responsibilities, including financial ones. While there's a traditional view that the guy pays more, mutual support and fairness are important. The author tried to split the rent, but she couldn't contribute. He ended up bearing the full financial burden, which might be unfair. However, breaking up and evicting someone can be a harsh response. Was there communication about expectations beforehand? The author might have felt cornered, but kicking someone out of a shared home abruptly could be seen as extreme. However, if the agreement was that costs would be split and she wasn't meeting her end, the author has a point. The girlfriend's suggestion that it was a test for an accident scenario seems like a stretch and possibly manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. If the author expected her to contribute and she couldn't, ending the relationship might be a valid choice. But the method\u2014kicking her out during the lease\u2014could be problematic. Maybe legal or more gradual steps would be better. However, the situation shows a lack of reciprocity, which is a valid reason for the author to act. \n\nSo, considering fairness and mutual responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary when expectations were unmet. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting him to cover everything despite knowing her financial issues, is questionable. The author's actions, while harsh, stem from a place of needing to manage his own finances, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer is likely B.\n"
