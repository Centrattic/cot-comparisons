Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. They moved in together, split rent initially, but she stopped contributing due to her own financial issues. He ends up paying full rent, leading to his own financial strain, and when she can't pay again, he kicks her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. When they moved in together, he expected to split the rent, which they did for a while. But then the girlfriend couldn't pay, so he covered the rent, which put him in a tough spot. Now she can't pay again, and she seems to expect him to cover everything, even calling it a test of his reaction.\n\nThe main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. When two people live together, splitting bills is typically expected. If one partner is unable to contribute, that's a problem. The author tried to work with her, even allowing her to pay in installments, but she didn't follow through. The author then decided to cut her out, which led to the breakup.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend might have known her financial situation before moving in together. If she couldn't contribute, it's possible she wasn't being honest about her ability to manage shared expenses. The author, on the other hand, might have set unclear boundaries early on. Initially, he helped with various expenses, which might have led her to expect he would cover everything. However, when it came time to split the rent, he expected her to contribute, and she wasn't able to, which caused conflict.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment that it was a test of how he'd react in a tough situation is problematic. Using a serious situation as a test without considering the partner's financial stability isn't fair. The author's reaction, while harsh, is understandable given the financial strain. However, kicking someone out of a shared home without a proper agreement or legal process might be an overreaction. Ideally, they should have discussed and agreed on a plan for handling financial difficulties before things escalated.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both parties have some faults. The author might have been too lenient early on, allowing her to expect he'd always cover costs. The girlfriend didn't communicate her financial limitations upfront and then didn't follow through when asked to contribute. However, the author's final decision to end the relationship and kick her out seems like a reasonable step when all options were exhausted, especially since she showed no intention to meet her responsibilities. So, while there are elements of fault on both sides, the main issue is the girlfriend's lack of contribution and the author's attempt to set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
