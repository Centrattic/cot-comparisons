Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation as presented. The author mentions that he believed he should pay for most things but expects some give and take. Initially, he covered most expenses, and she sometimes paid for things and cleaned. When they moved in together, they split the rent, but she stopped contributing after a while, citing her own financial issues. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough spot. When asked again, she refused to help, leading him to kick her out.\n\nI should consider the concept of fairness in relationships. Financial responsibility is a common issue in couples. The author tried to compromise by splitting rent initially but was left to pay everything after she couldn't contribute. He then took action to protect his own financial stability. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior might be seen as taking advantage, especially if she knew the author would cover her expenses. Her reasoning that it's a test for potential future issues like accidents might not hold weight here because financial support during an accident is different from ongoing rent payments. \n\nLegally, if the apartment is in the author's name, he's responsible for the rent regardless. Kicking her out might be problematic unless they had a specific agreement. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. \n\nThe author's actions were to take control of his finances when he felt exploited. Even though splitting rent is common, it's a mutual agreement. If one party can't fulfill their part, the other has the right to adjust. The author's frustration is understandable given the financial strain. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his financial well-being and ending the relationship when his partner couldn't meet her responsibilities. The answer should be B.\n"
