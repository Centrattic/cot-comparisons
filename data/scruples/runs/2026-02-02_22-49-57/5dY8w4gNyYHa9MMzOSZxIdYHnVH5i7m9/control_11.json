Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up and kicking the girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The writer explains that he took on most of the financial responsibilities, even before moving in together. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share, leading to him paying the full rent. He got fed up and asked her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The writer mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, in their relationship, the balance shifted heavily to him covering everything, even when they were living together. The girlfriend couldn't pay her share, and when he asked her to contribute, her response was dismissive, implying he should handle it as her boyfriend. The writer then decided to end the relationship and have her leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Financial responsibility in a relationship is a common point of contention. It's generally agreed that both partners should contribute to shared expenses when cohabiting. If one partner is consistently failing to contribute, it can cause significant stress. The writer had to cover the full rent, which put him in a precarious financial position. His frustration seems justified, especially since he had his own debts and financial obligations to manage.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have had her own financial struggles. Her saying it was a test suggests she might not have been entirely honest about her financial situation. However, her inability to pay rent is a serious issue. The writer had set an expectation of splitting the rent, and she wasn't meeting that. The final straw was her refusal to even pay a few hundred dollars, and her dismissive attitude towards his financial burden.\n\nEthically, while relationships require support, there's a limit to how much one person should bear the financial load alone. The writer's decision to end the relationship because of this imbalance isn't necessarily wrong. He had communicated his expectations, and she didn't meet them. The girlfriend's reasoning that being a boyfriend means he should handle her financial issues is problematic because it's not a healthy or fair expectation. Financial responsibility is a shared aspect of a partnership, and one person shouldn't be expected to cover everything indefinitely without reciprocity.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the writer had been okay with covering more expenses before moving in together, maybe he didn't set clear boundaries. But once they moved in together, splitting rent is standard. Her inability to contribute led to his financial strain, and he had the right to address the situation. The fact that she viewed it as a test shows a lack of consideration for his financial well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer was in a situation where his financial responsibilities were becoming unsustainable due to the girlfriend's inability to contribute. His decision to end the relationship under these circumstances isn't in the wrong. The key issue here is the imbalance in financial contribution, and the girlfriend's actions (or lack thereof) led to the breakup. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
