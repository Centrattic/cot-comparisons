Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend and kicking her out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend moved in, and initially, they split the rent. However, she started not paying her share, citing her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When he asked her to pay back or contribute, she refused, leading him to kick her out.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Legally, if they were in a lease together, both are responsible for the rent. If he's the one paying the full amount, maybe he's fulfilling his part of the lease, but if she's not contributing, that's an issue. But if they're in a cohabitation agreement where they agreed to split the rent, then she not paying could be a breach. However, since they're in a relationship, maybe there wasn't a formal agreement. \n\nEmotionally and morally, the author felt that he was being taken advantage of. He mentions that she had a mindset where the guy should pay everything, which he initially accepted but later felt was unequal. When she couldn't pay, he stepped in, but now she's not helping, which led to the breakup. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning was that if she needed help, the boyfriend should support her, as if it's a test of his commitment. The author argues that this is different from a medical emergency and that he can't keep covering her expenses without financial consequences for himself. \n\nFactors to consider: Was there an agreement about splitting bills? Did the author set boundaries? If he agreed to split the rent and she didn't pay her share, he's not in the wrong for enforcing that. However, if he didn't clearly communicate expectations, maybe he shares some responsibility. Also, kicking someone out might be a harsh reaction, but if the lease is under his name and she's not contributing, he might have the right to ask her to leave. \n\nLegally, if she's a tenant and not paying, he could have a right to evict her. Emotionally, it's possible that the author was frustrated and took a stand, which might be justified. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting support without reciprocity could be the main issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably isn't in the wrong. He tried to split the rent, she didn't pay, and he had to cover it. His financial situation suffered, and he decided to end the relationship when she refused to take responsibility. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be the main problem here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
