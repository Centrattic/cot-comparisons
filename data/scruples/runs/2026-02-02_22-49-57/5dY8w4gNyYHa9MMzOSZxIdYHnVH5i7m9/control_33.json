Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy is paying all the rent and other expenses, and when the girlfriend can't pay her share, he kicks her out. He mentions that he believes the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. When they move in together, they split the rent initially, but she stops paying, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author feels he's being taken advantage of, especially since he's already helping with her debts. He's in a precarious financial situation because he's paying full rent. The girlfriend's reasoning that it's a test for how he'd handle an accident is questionable because financial inability isn't the same as an accident.\n\nBut wait, in many relationships, shared responsibilities are expected. If they moved in together, splitting rent is standard. If she can't contribute, maybe there's an issue of accountability. However, breaking up and evicting her might be a harsh reaction. But considering the ongoing financial strain and lack of reciprocity, maybe he's justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything is problematic. The author tried to be lenient but reached a breaking point. However, the final decision to kick her out without a solution might be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe not. The girlfriend's use of a test is manipulative. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his financial well-being after repeated issues. The girlfriend's behavior is irresponsible, and the author's action is a response to her lack of contribution. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
