Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up and evicting his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: They were in a relationship where the guy paid most expenses, and the girl occasionally contributed. She moved in, didn't pay rent for six months, and now can't pay again. The author paid the rent, but it's causing him financial strain. When he asks her to pay back or contribute, she says it's because she has a boyfriend. The author then kicks her out and is paying full rent again.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider several factors. Financial responsibility in relationships is a key point here. Typically, in a shared living situation, both parties are expected to contribute to shared expenses. If one person is consistently not contributing, it can lead to conflict. The author mentions that they split the rent after moving in together, but she couldn't pay. He paid the rent, which he couldn't afford, leading to his own financial issues. \n\nThen, when she can't pay again, he kicks her out. He argues that he's helping with her financial issues while his own are getting worse. The girlfriend's response that it was a \"test\" might be seen as manipulative or not taking responsibility. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue earlier, rather than accumulating debt. Also, kicking someone out of a shared home without legal means could be problematic. In some places, you can't just kick someone out unless there's a legal process, like eviction. If they're co-tenants, he might need to go through the proper legal steps. \n\nBut given that it's presented as a breakup, maybe the apartment is solely in his name. If she's a tenant, he might have the right to terminate the lease or not renew it. However, the situation is complicated because he's handling her finances as well. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified if he's in a position to manage the rent and they were in a cohabitation agreement. However, if he's taking on too much financial burden, it's understandable that he wants to end the arrangement. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior of not contributing and testing his reactions could be seen as irresponsible. The author's overreaction might be if he didn't communicate clearly about expectations from the start. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong since he's setting boundaries for himself after repeated financial strain. However, there could be a more constructive approach, like legal eviction proceedings if necessary. But in the context of the question, the immediate action of asking her to leave might be seen as his right if it's his apartment. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
