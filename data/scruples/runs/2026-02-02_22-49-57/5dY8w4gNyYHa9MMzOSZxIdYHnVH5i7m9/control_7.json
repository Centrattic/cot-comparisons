Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the background: The author mentions that from the start, the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things, and he went along with it. They moved in together, and she wasn't contributing equally. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but then she stopped paying, leading to the author paying full rent to avoid issues. Now she's refusing to pay again, and the author kicked her out. The girlfriend later says it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, but the author thinks that's different.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility and the expectations in a relationship. The author feels that the girlfriend isn't contributing her fair share, especially with rent, which is a major expense. He's in a financial bind because he's paying full rent, which affects his own bills and debts. The girlfriend, on the other hand, claims she can't pay due to her debts and seems to expect the author to cover everything, even after being asked to contribute.\n\nFinancial independence in a relationship is important. Even if one partner is paying more, there should be some mutual contribution, especially when living together. The author's frustration is understandable. He tried to compromise by splitting the rent initially, but when she couldn't pay, he covered it. Now she's not helping, and he's in a worse financial situation. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the author to handle everything, even when he's struggling, is problematic. Her comment about it being a test seems dismissive and doesn't take responsibility for her part in the situation.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to kick her out without maybe exploring other options first. Maybe he could have had a more detailed conversation about their financial expectations, set a clear agreement, or found a middle ground. But given that she's consistently not contributing and he's in financial distress, his decision might be seen as a last resort. Relationships require mutual support and understanding, but they also require fairness in responsibilities. If one partner is consistently taking without giving, that can be a valid reason to end the relationship, especially when it affects one's financial stability.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems to lack consideration for the author's financial situation. She's putting her own debts first and expecting the author to cover everything, which isn't sustainable. The author, while perhaps could have handled it with more communication, is justified in standing up for his own needs. So, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's taking a stand for his financial health, which is important. The girlfriend's actions are more to blame here.\n"
