Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her not paying rent is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend moved in with him, and initially, they split the rent. Then she started not contributing, citing her own financial issues. He ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a tough spot. When he confronted her, she said she expected him to handle everything because she had a boyfriend. The guy then kicked her out and now is paying full rent alone. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion. I need to decide between A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLet me consider the key points. Financial responsibilities in a relationship are a common issue. The guy set boundaries but they were crossed. He tried to split the rent, which she agreed to, but then couldn't follow through. He communicated his concerns, and when she couldn't contribute, he made a decision to end the relationship. Her expecting him to cover everything without any give and take seems unfair, especially since they were living together. The girlfriend's test comment might indicate she wasn't serious about contributing, which could be a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. Maybe the guy could have addressed the issue earlier or found another solution. However, the situation here seems like a breach of an agreed-upon responsibility. The guy's financial stability was at risk, and he acted to protect himself. \n\nIn conclusion, while there might be elements of miscommunication, the core issue is her not fulfilling her part of the agreement. The guy's actions seem justified as he prioritized his own financial well-being after multiple attempts to work it out. So the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
