Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the text is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the situation. The couple moved in together, initially splitting the rent. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, which caused him financial strain. The girlfriend continued to not pay, even when she said she could pay a few hundred. The author eventually kicks her out, and she claims it was a test. The author is now paying full rent again.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me consider the key points. Financial responsibility in relationships is a big issue. The author was paying most of the expenses from the start, and the girlfriend's contributions were minimal. When moving in together, splitting rent is typical, but if one partner can't contribute, that can lead to conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's been covering most costs. The girlfriend's statement about it being a test to see how he'd react seems manipulative and inconsiderate. The author had to make a tough decision to protect his own financial stability, which is a valid reason. However, breaking up and kicking someone out might be seen as harsh, but if the situation was unsustainable, maybe it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have had a conversation earlier about financial expectations instead of waiting until the problem escalated. But given the context, the author tried to work with her, allowed her to move in, and even let her pay when she could. The final straw was her lack of support when he needed help. The girlfriend's reasoning about testing his reaction is problematic. The author's decision, while difficult, might be necessary for his own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
