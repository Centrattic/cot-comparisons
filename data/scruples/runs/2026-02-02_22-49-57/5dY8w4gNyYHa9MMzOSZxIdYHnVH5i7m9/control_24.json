Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over rent issues is in the wrong. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is the guy who ended the relationship after his girlfriend couldn't pay rent. He mentions that he was paying for most things, even before they moved in together. She did help occasionally with cleaning and sometimes paid for things, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after a few months, citing her debts. He paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When he asked her to pay back or at least contribute, she refused, leading to the breakup. She later claims it was a test to see how he'd handle her financial problems, but the author doesn't buy that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship is a big deal. Cohabiting couples usually agree on splitting expenses. If one partner can't or won't contribute, it can lead to conflict. The author tried to compromise by splitting rent initially, but when she couldn't pay, he had to cover it. He seems to have set boundaries when she refused to help, which might be seen as reasonable. On the other hand, maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier, like when she first couldn't pay, instead of waiting until it escalated. But given that she moved in expecting him to pay, and she had debts, perhaps he's justified in ending the relationship to avoid financial strain. Also, her attitude of expecting him to cover everything without reciprocity might be the real issue here.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that she was in a tough spot financially and maybe expected support as part of a relationship. But that doesn't mean she's right to not contribute. Relationships require mutual effort and compromise. If one person is consistently taking without giving, that's a problem. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to protect his own finances, especially if he was already struggling. Ending the relationship when someone isn't meeting their financial responsibilities might be a reasonable decision.\n\nThe key points are mutual financial contribution expectations. The author tried to negotiate, but she wouldn't meet her part. So he's not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
