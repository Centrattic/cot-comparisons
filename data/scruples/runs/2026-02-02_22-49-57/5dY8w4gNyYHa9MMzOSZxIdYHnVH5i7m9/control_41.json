Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. He moved in with her and they were splitting rent, but she started not contributing after some time. He ended up paying the full rent, and when he confronted her, she said it was a test. He kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. The guy mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, she stopped contributing beyond cleaning. He ended up paying all the rent, which caused him financial strain. \n\nThe key point here is whether he had a prior agreement. If they were splitting rent equally, and she agreed to contribute but then couldn't, that's a problem. The user might argue that in a shared living situation, both parties should contribute to expenses. If she couldn't meet her share, maybe he has a right to ask her to leave if he's the one covering everything. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships can involve financial support, especially if there's a history of the guy paying for most things. But when they move in together, a mutual agreement on expenses is important. If she expected him to pay everything without contributing, that's a one-sided arrangement. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations might be seen as manipulative or thoughtless. The guy is in a tough spot because he's shouldering all the financial burden, which can lead to resentment. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is crucial. If both parties can't meet their obligations, maybe the relationship isn't viable. The guy's decision to end things might be justified if he felt it was unfair and there was no resolution. But if they had an agreement where she expected to pay nothing, he might be in the wrong for not setting clear boundaries earlier. \n\nHowever, in this case, the guy did try to split the rent initially, and she wasn't holding up her end. He had to pay full rent, which caused him financial stress. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to cover everything without reciprocation seems to be the main issue. Therefore, the guy's actions in ending the relationship might be justified.\n"
