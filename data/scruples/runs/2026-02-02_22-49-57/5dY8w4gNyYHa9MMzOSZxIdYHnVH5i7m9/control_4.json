Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially, she didn't pay rent for six months. Then, when they started splitting the rent, she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which affected his finances. When he asked her to pay back or help, she didn't, leading him to kick her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction to tough situations.\n\nNow, financial responsibility in relationships is important. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting rent is a common practice. The girlfriend not contributing her share, especially after agreeing to split, could be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is understandable because he's taking on the financial burden alone, which can lead to stress and potential conflicts.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test of his commitment in a crisis might not be a valid excuse. Financial responsibility is a mutual expectation in most cohabiting relationships. Her not contributing despite knowing her financial situation could be seen as taking advantage. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this might be justified, especially if he felt it was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author had previously allowed her to live rent-free for six months, which might have set an expectation that she wouldn't need to pay. But once they agreed to split, not following through on that agreement could be a problem. The author's reaction might be seen as necessary if he couldn't sustain the financial load alone. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. The author isn't wrong for ending the relationship if the financial imbalance was a significant issue for him. On the other hand, maybe he should have addressed the problem earlier rather than waiting until it escalated. But given the circumstances, his actions might be justified. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
