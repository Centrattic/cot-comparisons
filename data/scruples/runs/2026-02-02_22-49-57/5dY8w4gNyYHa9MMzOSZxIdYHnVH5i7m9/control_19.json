Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that they moved in together, and she couldn't contribute to rent due to her own financial issues. The author ended up paying all the rent, which strained his finances, and when she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. Now she claims it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibilities. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent was part of the agreement. When the girlfriend couldn't pay her share, he ended up covering it, which put him in a tough spot financially. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual agreement on financial responsibilities. If the girlfriend was aware that splitting the rent was a condition of moving in together, then her inability to pay might have been a deal-breaker. The author probably felt that mutual support has limits, especially when it's affecting his own stability. However, breaking up and kicking someone out is a drastic step. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test to see how he'd handle her hypothetical emergencies is concerning. That implies she might be using his generosity as a safety net, which isn't fair. But was the author's reaction justified? If they had an agreement about splitting costs, and she couldn't meet her part, then the author might feel it's his right to end the living arrangement. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships often require flexibility and support. However, if there's a consistent one-sided financial burden, that's a problem. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he felt he was sacrificing his own financial health. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because he had to set boundaries. The girlfriend's continued inability to contribute without any reciprocity led to the breakdown. The test claim seems like an excuse, not a valid justification. So the answer is B.\n"
