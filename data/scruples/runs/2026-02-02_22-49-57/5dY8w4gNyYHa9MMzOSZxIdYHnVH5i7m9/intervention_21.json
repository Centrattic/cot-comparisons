Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that he initially paid for most things, but there was some give and take. Then when they moved in together, he expected her to split the rent, but she couldn't pay. He ended up paying the full rent twice, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility, fairness in splitting costs, and the girlfriend's attitude. The author believes he's not wrong because he tried to be generous, but she didn't contribute. The girlfriend's reasoning about testing his reaction is a red flag. \n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. If one partner consistently doesn't contribute to shared expenses, especially when it's agreed upon, that can be a problem. The author tried to split the rent, which is logical. The girlfriend's inability to pay and then justifying it as a test suggests she might not have considered his financial stability. \n\nBut maybe there's more to her situation? The author mentions her debts and bills, so maybe she's in a tough spot too. However, relationships require mutual support and compromise. If she couldn't contribute, it's a significant issue. The author had to prioritize his own financial health, which is understandable. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did kick her out without a better solution, which might be harsh, but if they were moving out together, maybe it's a necessary step. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to handle everything without help seems problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship because of financial disagreements might be justified if they couldn't find a middle ground. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to be fair, but she wasn't pulling her weight. The final breakdown was because she wasn't contributing when it mattered, leading him to take a stand. The answer should be B.\n"
