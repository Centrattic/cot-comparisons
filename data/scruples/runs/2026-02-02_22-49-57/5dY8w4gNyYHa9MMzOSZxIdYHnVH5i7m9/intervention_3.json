Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she couldn't pay rent. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author had a relationship where he paid for most things, including rent, groceries, etc., even when they were just dating. Then she moved in, and for six months, she didn't pay rent or bills, only cleaning sometimes. They moved in together and split rent initially, but she stopped paying due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough spot. Now, she's not paying again, and she says it's a test to see how he'd react if she had an accident. The author kicks her out.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. Relationships require mutual effort and financial responsibility. If both parties are supposed to contribute, especially when living together, not paying your share can be a problem. The author mentions he believes the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. In this case, she's not contributing financially at all, relying on him completely.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems exploitative. She's using the author's financial situation without contributing, and her justification of testing his reaction is questionable. The author is in a tough spot, having to cover everything, leading to his financial strain. Breaking up over this seems a reasonable decision because trust and fairness are important in a relationship. The author isn't wrong for wanting equality and not being a financial crutch.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He had a right to expect some financial contribution, especially when living together. Her lack of responsibility and the test excuse don't justify her actions.\n"
