Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The story goes that she moved in, didn't contribute much, and now she's not paying rent, leading to the breakup. The author is saying he's the one who ended up paying everything and now she's leaving him in a financial bind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple moved in together, and it seems like they didn't have a clear agreement on splitting expenses. The author mentions that he paid for most things before they moved in, and after moving in, she wasn't contributing equally. Then, when she couldn't pay rent, he ended up covering it, which caused him financial stress. Now she's not paying at all, and he kicks her out.\n\nI should think about relationship norms and expectations. In many relationships, splitting bills is discussed, especially when moving in together. If there's no agreement, it can lead to conflict. The author felt that his contributions weren't balanced. The girlfriend's reasoning that she expects the guy to pay everything might not be fair in the long run, especially when they're sharing a home. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part of any partnership. If one person is consistently relying on the other without contributing, that can create a one-sided dynamic. The author's frustration is understandable. He's putting himself in a precarious financial situation to support her, which might not be sustainable. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's a test for how he'd react in her hypothetical accident is a bit concerning. Using such a scenario to justify not paying rent seems like poor communication. The author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as standing up for his own financial stability. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did they have a conversation about rent splitting before moving in? If not, the author might share some responsibility for not setting boundaries. But given the situation, it's clear that he tried to split the costs and she wasn't meeting her end, leading to his decision to end the relationship to protect his finances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem justified. He's prioritizing his own financial health after repeated issues with her not contributing. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without balance is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
