Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend moved in together. The author mentions that the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, which he did, but felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent, but then she stopped contributing because of her own debts. The author ended up paying full rent twice, which put them in financial strain. The girlfriend's reasoning for not paying was that she had her own bills and debts. The author broke up with her and asked her to leave. Now she claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis, but the author disagrees, feeling that this isn't the same as an emergency situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points of contention. The key issue seems to be financial responsibility in a relationship. The author is taking a stand when it comes to rent payments, which is a significant part of living expenses. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute to rent, despite the author covering it, leading to financial strain for the author. The author decided to end the relationship because they felt their own financial stability was being compromised.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and expectations. In many relationships, there's an expectation of shared financial responsibilities, especially when living together. However, this can vary based on individual circumstances and agreements. The author mentions that they initially had an agreement to split the rent, but the girlfriend stopped contributing, leading to the author paying full rent. This could be seen as a breach of the mutual agreement they had when moving in together.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that she has her own debts and bills might be a valid reason for her inability to pay, but it's important to note that relationships typically require some level of compromise and support. However, if she's consistently not contributing and expecting the partner to handle all expenses, that could be problematic. The author is concerned about their own financial obligations and feels that their support is one-sided.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment about it being a test to see how the author would handle an emergency seems to be an attempt to justify her actions, but the author rightly argues that a voluntary financial choice isn't the same as an unexpected emergency. This might be a misunderstanding of the situation's severity from her side.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they are maintaining their own financial health and setting boundaries when they feel their partner is not meeting their part of the agreement. It's reasonable for someone to expect their partner to contribute to shared living costs, especially when moving in together. The author's decision to end the relationship based on this financial misalignment could be seen as a responsible action to protect their own financial stability.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did the author address the issue with the girlfriend before breaking up? The narrative suggests that they had discussions where the girlfriend indicated she couldn't pay, but she didn't seem to take the author's concerns seriously. The author's frustration is justified if the girlfriend is not willing to find a solution or compromise, such as contributing in other ways or addressing her own debts.\n\nIn summary, the author acted based on their own financial needs and the expectation of shared responsibility in the relationship. The girlfriend's lack of contribution to rent, despite the author's willingness to support her in other ways, led to a breakdown in their mutual agreement. The author's decision to end the relationship seems to be a response to protect their financial well-being, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
