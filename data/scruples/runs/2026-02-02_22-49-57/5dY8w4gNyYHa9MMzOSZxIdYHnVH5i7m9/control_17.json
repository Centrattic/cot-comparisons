Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The couple moved in together, initially split the rent, but then she couldn't pay due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, which put them in financial strain. When asked to help with the next month, she said she couldn't, and when confronted, she said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" leading the author to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and expectations. The author mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. However, when the financial burden became unsustainable, they decided to end the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation is problematic. Using someone's financial stress as a test without considering the consequences is manipulative. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since their own financial stability is at risk.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider mutual responsibility in a relationship. While it's common for partners to support each other, there's a limit when one person's financial irresponsibility affects the other's ability to meet their obligations. The author made the decision to end the relationship to protect their financial health, which is a valid reason.\n\nHowever, some might argue that communication could have been handled better or that the author didn't give enough time. But given the repeated failures to contribute and the lack of accountability from the girlfriend, the author's actions seem justified. Breaking up over financial irresponsibility isn't inherently wrong, especially when it leads to personal hardship.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their own financial stability after multiple instances of the girlfriend not contributing as agreed. The answer should be B (No).\n"
