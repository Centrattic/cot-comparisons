Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he initially paid for most things, like dinners and groceries, expecting some give and take. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share of the rent due to her financial issues. He paid the full rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction to tough situations, which he disagrees with.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, financial responsibility is a big deal. Partners are expected to contribute to shared expenses, especially when living together. If one person consistently can't or won't contribute, it can cause strain. The author set a boundary by splitting the rent initially, which she then violated. His frustration seems valid because he's taking on financial burdens that affect his own obligations.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that she was testing his commitment, which might indicate she wasn't taking the relationship seriously or wasn't financially stable. The author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship\u2014could be seen as a necessary step to protect his own financial health.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, while it's commendable that he tried to accommodate her financially, there's a point where one needs to set limits. Kicking her out might be harsh, but if the situation is unsustainable and she's not willing to meet her responsibilities, it's a reasonable decision. The key here is whether the author acted within reasonable bounds. He communicated his expectations, she didn't meet them, and he made a decision to end the relationship. That doesn't make him wrong. The girl's expectations of the guy paying everything, without reciprocity, might be the bigger issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his financial stability and setting boundaries in a relationship where the other party isn't meeting their end of the agreement. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her test comment show a lack of responsibility, which justifies his decision.\n"
