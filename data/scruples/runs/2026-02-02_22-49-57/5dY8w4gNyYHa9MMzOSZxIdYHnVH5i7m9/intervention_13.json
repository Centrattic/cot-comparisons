Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is described in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" format.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author had a girlfriend who moved in with him, and initially, she didn't pay rent or bills for six months. They later moved in together and split the rent for a couple of months. Then she couldn't pay, and he covered it, which strained his finances. When she failed to pay again, he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, but he insists that's different.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down the responsibilities in a cohabiting relationship. Typically, when two people move in together, splitting costs is expected. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, the girlfriend moved in rent-free for six months and then couldn't contribute later. This seems like an imbalance. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part of a relationship, especially when living together. The author had to cover all the rent, which put his own finances at risk. He communicated with her, tried to work it out, but she wasn't able or willing to contribute. The girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything and her claim that it was a test might be a sign of irresponsibility or manipulation. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave seems like a response to a breach of trust and unmet responsibilities. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014failing to pay her share, not addressing her debts, and treating the situation as a test\u2014could be seen as the main issue here. \n\nFrom an objective standpoint, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries and prioritizing his own financial stability. Expecting a partner to contribute to shared living expenses is reasonable. The girlfriend's lack of commitment to her part of the agreement likely led to the breakup. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the core issue is the girlfriend's failure to meet financial obligations, and the author making a stand to protect his own situation. The test comment from the girlfriend also suggests she may not have taken the responsibilities seriously, which justifies the author's reaction."
