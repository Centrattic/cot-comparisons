Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author mentions that he was okay with paying for most things, but there was an expectation of some reciprocity. When they moved in together, he expected them to split the rent, but she couldn't pay. He got angry and kicked her out. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he was helping her financially, but the relationship became one-sided, especially with her not contributing to shared expenses. The breaking point was her inability to pay rent, leading to his decision to end the relationship and cover the rent himself. \n\nNow, considering the response that the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, I need to evaluate if there's any fault on his part. Did he have a right to expect her to contribute to the rent when they moved in together? Yes, typically in a shared living situation, splitting costs is standard unless otherwise agreed. The problem arises when one person isn't contributing, leading to financial strain. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's managing his own debts. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did he address the issue before it escalated? The timeline shows that he had discussions with her about her inability to pay, but she didn't commit to a plan. The final confrontation where she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" seems dismissive of his financial struggles, which the author found unacceptable. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test of his commitment in a crisis might be a red flag, as it's not a real emergency but a recurring financial issue. The author's decision to end the relationship is a response to her ongoing inability to meet her responsibilities, which he found unsustainable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, financial expectations in relationships are crucial. If both parties are not on the same page about financial contributions, it can lead to conflict. The author's actions stem from his own financial stress caused by her inability to contribute. While it's harsh to kick someone out, it might be a necessary step if the relationship is causing significant financial harm. \n\nNo one is entirely without fault. The girlfriend's inability to manage her finances and the author's initial reluctance to set boundaries might both play a role. However, given the situation described, the author's decision to end the relationship is a reaction to her not meeting agreed-upon responsibilities, which he had communicated was important to him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
