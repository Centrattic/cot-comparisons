Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, split the rent for a couple of months. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay due to her debts and it happened again. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction, which he disagrees with.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author took on the burden of paying the full rent, which he couldn't afford, leading him to cut ties. The girlfriend expected him to cover her expenses, which he found unequal. \n\nNow, considering relationship norms, it's common for couples to split expenses, but expectations can vary. The author believed in the guy paying most but with some give and take. However, the girlfriend's inability to contribute led to financial stress. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he made a choice to end the relationship when it became unsustainable. The girlfriend's actions (not paying rent, using her debts as an excuse) might be seen as irresponsible. The author prioritized his own financial stability, which is understandable. \n\nBut some might argue that kicking someone out abruptly is harsh, even if they're not paying their share. However, the author had tried to communicate and set boundaries, which were ignored. The girlfriend's test explanation seems dismissive of his feelings and problems. \n\nIn such situations, communication is key. The author felt wronged and took action when he felt it was necessary. While being in a relationship often involves compromise, there's a limit when one person's financial irresponsibility affects the other's stability. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He acted when the situation became unsustainable. The girlfriend's behavior and lack of contribution led to the breakup. So the answer is B.\n"
