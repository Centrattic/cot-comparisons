Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a breakup because his girlfriend couldn't pay rent. He's saying she expects him to pay for everything, even after moving in together. They split rent for a while, but now she can't pay, and he ends up paying all the rent again, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions that he was paying for most things, which he says is his belief as a guy, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, contributed occasionally but not equally. When they moved in together, he expected splitting the rent, but she couldn't pay, so he ended up covering it. Then, when she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nI think about financial responsibilities in relationships. It's common for couples to split costs when living together, but it depends on their agreement. The problem here is that the author is shouldering all the financial burden, which can create stress. The girlfriend's inability to contribute might be due to her own financial issues, but the author feels it's unfair. \n\nThe key points are whether the author overreacted or if he had a right to ask for equal contribution. He did mention that he believed the guy should pay for most but expected some give and take. When she couldn't contribute, he felt it was his last straw. The girlfriend's response about it being a test might be an excuse to see his reaction, but the author argues that the situation isn't the same as an emergency. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms here. Some might think the guy should handle the finances, but others argue for equality. Since the author was already paying for everything and the girlfriend wasn't contributing, he might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like discussing a financial plan earlier. But given the circumstances, his actions seem justified. The final decision would be whether he overstepped or if his actions were reasonable given the financial strain.\n"
