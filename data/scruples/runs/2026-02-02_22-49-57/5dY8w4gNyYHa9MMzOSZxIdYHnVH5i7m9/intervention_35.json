Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out after she couldn't pay rent. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author describes a pattern where he paid for most things, including rent, groceries, and events. The girlfriend did pay occasionally and helped with cleaning, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she initially split the rent but then couldn't pay due to her debts. He ended up covering the rent, which caused his own financial strain. She continued to not pay her share, leading him to kick her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction to financial stress.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Financial responsibilities in a relationship can be a sensitive topic. The author expected some give and take but felt it wasn't balanced. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a common arrangement. However, when she couldn't pay, he stepped in, which he might have done out of kindness or obligation. But when she continued to not contribute, his frustration led him to end the relationship.\n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility and communication. If the couple hadn't discussed financial expectations beforehand, that could be a problem. However, the girlfriend's behavior\u2014prioritizing her own debts and not contributing her share\u2014might have crossed a line. The author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as a response to her not meeting her part of the agreement, especially when it's causing him financial hardship.\n\nHer claiming it was a test complicates things. It suggests she might have anticipated this reaction, which could be manipulative. However, if she genuinely had financial difficulties, the author might have chosen to support her despite the strain. But since he felt it was unfair, his decision to end things might be justified.\n\nLegally, if the lease is in his name, he's responsible for the rent. Kicking her out without a legal process could be an issue, but the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. Morally, the author might feel justified, but some might argue he could have handled it differently, like finding alternative solutions together. However, given the repeated issues and her lack of contribution, his actions seem like a last resort.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He made a tough decision to address an unfair financial burden after multiple attempts to resolve the issue. The girlfriend's behavior, especially the test comment, shows a lack of consideration for his situation.\n"
