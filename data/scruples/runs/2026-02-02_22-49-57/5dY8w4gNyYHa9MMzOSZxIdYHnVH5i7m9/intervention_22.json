Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nThe author had a girlfriend who moved into their apartment. He mentions that she expected him to pay for most things, and even when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share of the rent. He ended up paying all the rent and groceries, which put him in a tough financial spot because of his own debts. When he confronted her about not contributing, she said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. He then kicked her out because he felt she wasn't giving anything back.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and financial responsibilities. Typically, when two people move in together, it's expected that they split the costs. If one person can't pay their share, especially if it's a recurring issue, that can cause a lot of stress. The author seems to have been covering everything, which isn't fair in the long run. But does that make him right to kick her out?\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning about it being a test is concerning. She's using a hypothetical emergency to justify not helping financially. That seems like a bad attitude. If she couldn't pay her share, maybe she should have communicated that earlier or found a solution together. However, the author's reaction was to end the relationship and ask her to leave. Is that too harsh?\n\nFinancial strain is a major issue in relationships. If the author felt that his financial situation was being jeopardized and there was no compromise, ending the relationship might be a valid choice. But maybe there were other steps he could have taken before deciding to kick her out. Like setting clear boundaries earlier or discussing finances more openly.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there needs to be give and take. However, if the balance is completely one-sided, it's understandable to feel exploited. The girlfriend's lack of contribution, even when asked to pay back, shows a lack of consideration for his financial health.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, if she was living in his apartment and he's the sole tenant, he has the right to ask her to leave if they're not married. So legally, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, though, it's a tough call. He was already stretched thin and the final straw was her not paying anything again. \n\nConsidering all this, the author acted based on his own financial limits and the lack of support from his partner. The girlfriend's approach seems to be taking advantage, and the author made a decision to protect his own well-being. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
