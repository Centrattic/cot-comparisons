Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking out their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their girlfriend moved in together, split the rent initially. Then she couldn't pay her share due to her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which strained their finances. When the next month came, she said she couldn't pay anything again, leading the author to kick her out. She later claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me consider both sides. Financial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. The author might feel that there's an expectation of shared responsibility, especially since she initially moved in and then stopped contributing. But relationships can be complex. Maybe the author didn't set clear boundaries from the start. If they agreed to split the rent but she wasn't able to pay, maybe the author should have discussed this earlier instead of waiting until it became a problem. However, if she had a history of not contributing equally even before moving in together, the author might have valid concerns about fairness. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test is concerning. That suggests she might have intentionally put the author in a difficult position to see how they'd handle it, which is manipulative. The author's reaction of ending the relationship when their financial stability was at risk seems reasonable, especially if they felt it was a one-way relationship in terms of contributions. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author overreacted. If they had communication issues and didn't address the imbalance earlier, maybe they share some responsibility. But given that the girlfriend was unwilling to contribute and even tested the author, the decision to leave might be justified. The key points are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual respect. Since the girlfriend wasn't paying her share and the author felt their own financial health was compromised, the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
