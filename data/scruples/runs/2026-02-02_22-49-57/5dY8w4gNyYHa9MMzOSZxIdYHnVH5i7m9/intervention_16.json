Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that he paid for most things initially, and she would occasionally pay for some stuff and help with cleaning. Then, when they moved in together, she said she couldn't pay rent due to her debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough spot financially. After she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test, but he disagrees.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree. The answer options are A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some relationships, it's common for one partner to take on more financial responsibility, but when it becomes one-sided and unsustainable, that can be a problem. The author mentions he believed in the guy paying for most things but wanted some give and take. The girlfriend wasn't contributing as much as he expected, leading to financial strain.\n\nWhen they moved in together, splitting the rent is standard. The fact that she couldn't contribute led to the author having to pay everything, which he couldn't sustain. His reaction was to end the relationship because he felt it was unfair and unsustainable. The girlfriend's argument that it was a test seems like a justification for her lack of responsibility, which the author found unacceptable.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, expecting mutual contribution in shared expenses is reasonable. The author's frustration is valid if he's shouldering all the financial burden. The girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to pay might be due to her own financial issues, but in a shared living situation, both parties usually need to contribute. The author's decision to end the relationship under these circumstances could be seen as justifiable because he's prioritizing his own financial stability and the balance in the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's testing rationale doesn't address the actual problem; it's more about her expecting him to support her without any reciprocal effort. The author's overreaction might be questioned if there were attempts to communicate and resolve the issue before breaking up. However, the situation had been building up over months, and the final trigger was her not contributing, leading him to make a firm decision. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem like a response to a long-standing imbalance that he couldn't resolve through other means. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
