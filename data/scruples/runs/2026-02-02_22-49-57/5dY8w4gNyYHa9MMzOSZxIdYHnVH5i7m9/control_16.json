Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out for not paying rent is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that he consistently paid for most things during their relationship, and after moving in together, his girlfriend stopped contributing to rent. She couldn't pay due to her debts, which he found unacceptable. He ended up paying the full rent, leading to his own financial stress. When she couldn't pay again, he asked her to leave.\n\nThere are a few key points here. Financial responsibility in a relationship is often a sensitive topic. The author believes that while the guy should pay for most things, there should be some give and take. However, after moving in together, the expectation of splitting rent wasn't met by his partner. Financial stress can cause a lot of strain, and the author feels that his own financial stability is being compromised.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, it's common for couples to split expenses when living together, but there's no one-size-fits-all approach. The girlfriend's inability to pay might be due to her financial situation, but if she couldn't contribute, that's a problem. The author tried to find a solution, like having her pay back later, but she didn't follow through. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that she was testing his reaction is a bit concerning. Using a partner's financial situation as a test could be seen as manipulative. The author's decision to ask her to leave might be harsh, but if he's in a position where he can't afford the rent alone, he has a right to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, kicking someone out of a shared home can be legally and emotionally complicated. If they were in a lease together, the author might need to follow proper procedures to avoid legal issues. Emotionally, the situation is tense, and the author's frustration is valid given the financial strain. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be justified in setting boundaries, especially if he can't afford the rent alone. But the way he handled it (kicking her out) could be seen as extreme. However, considering the context of her not contributing and the test comment, his reaction might be understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would be leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his financial well-being and setting clear boundaries. But there's a nuance where communication and legal steps could have been considered first. Still, given the circumstances, his actions are a reaction to her financial irresponsibility and lack of contribution.\n"
