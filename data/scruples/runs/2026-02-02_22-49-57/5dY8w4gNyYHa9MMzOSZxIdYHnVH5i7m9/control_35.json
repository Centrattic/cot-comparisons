Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if they're at fault. \n\nFirst, the user mentions that the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for everything\u2014dinners, events, trips, groceries. She would pay occasionally but not equally. The guy believed the guy should pay most of the time, but there should be some give and take. Then she moved in, and for six months, she didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. When they moved in together, she agreed to split the rent but later couldn't pay due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough spot. The next month, she said she couldn't pay anything again, and the author kicked her out. After breaking up, she claims it was a test to see how he'd react.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was right to kick her out. Let's break it down.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a big deal. If both people are living together, splitting expenses is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The author took on the majority of the costs from the start, and even when they moved in together, she couldn't contribute. The author had to pay full rent twice, which strained his finances. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation that the guy should pay everything, even when living together, might be part of the issue. The author tried to be generous but felt it wasn't equal. When she couldn't or wouldn't pay her share, leading to financial stress, the author decided to end the relationship. \n\nShe later said it was a test, which seems like a justification for her behavior. That could be seen as manipulative or irresponsible, as she put her partner in a difficult situation. \n\nFinancial compatibility is crucial in relationships. If one partner is consistently unable or unwilling to contribute their fair share, it can lead to conflict. The author made a choice to end the relationship when it became unsustainable. \n\nBut was it overreacting? The author had to cover all the costs, which could be a valid reason to end things. However, maybe there could have been a discussion to adjust their living arrangements or payment plans. But given that she couldn't pay due to her own debts and wasn't willing to contribute, the author's decision might be justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author seems to be in the right because the girlfriend wasn't meeting her financial responsibilities, leading to the author's financial strain. The author's actions were a response to a situation where the balance was unequal, and they couldn't sustain it. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting the author to bear all costs, might be the root issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
