Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author paid for most things, including rent when they moved in together. The girlfriend started not paying her share, citing her own debts. The author ends up paying all the rent, leading to financial strain. The final straw was when she said she couldn't pay and didn't see the need to help with rent, leading the author to ask her to leave.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author expected some contribution from the girlfriend, which she didn't provide. The girlfriend's justification was that the guy should pay for everything, which the author initially went along with but found unequal. When they moved in together, splitting rent was an agreement, but she couldn't pay. The author had to cover it, which is causing him financial issues. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting him to support her financially without reciprocation led to the breakup.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a shared living situation, splitting costs is common. If the girlfriend couldn't contribute, maybe she should have communicated better or left. The author had the right to set boundaries. However, relationships involve compromise. The author might have been too strict, but given the financial strain, his decision seems justified. The girlfriend's testing his reaction by not paying rent is problematic. The author prioritized his financial stability, which is reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
