Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, which he did, but she didn't contribute equally. They moved in together, split rent for a while, but then she stopped paying because of her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author felt it's unfair to carry all the financial burden, especially when the relationship isn't balanced. The girlfriend's actions led to the author making a decision to end the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, shared financial responsibilities are common, especially when living together. If one partner isn't contributing and it's causing financial stress, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. The author tried to work it out, allowing her to pay some amount, but she didn't follow through. His decision to ask her to leave because she wasn't contributing seems like a response to self-preservation, not just being selfish. \n\nShe also mentioned it was a test, which might indicate she wasn't serious about her responsibilities. The author's frustration is understandable. Financial strain is a major stressor in relationships. If someone isn't willing to meet their obligations, it's a sign of potential deeper issues. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He made a tough choice to end the relationship when his boundaries were crossed. It's about mutual respect and responsibility. If she didn't want to contribute, maybe the relationship wasn't balanced. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
