Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wasn't contributing equally. The author initially paid for most things, but when she started saying she couldn't pay rent due to her own debts, he had enough and made her leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The user mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there needs to be some give and take. The girlfriend, however, seemed to expect him to cover everything without reciprocation. When they moved in together, splitting rent was agreed upon, but she stopped contributing, leading to financial strain.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contributions. It's common for couples to split expenses when living together, especially rent and bills, as fairness and equality are important. If one partner can't or won't contribute, it can cause tension. The author had to pay the full rent, which affected his ability to manage his own debts. That's a valid concern, especially if he's struggling financially.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test to see how he'd react is a bit strange. Testing a partner by not paying rent isn't a typical or healthy approach. It's more about expecting the other person to handle all the financial burdens without any discussion or compromise. The author's frustration is understandable because he was already helping her with other expenses and expected some reciprocity, even if it wasn't equal every time.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it\u2014throwing her out\u2014might be seen as harsh. Maybe a better approach would have been to have a conversation about their financial expectations and find a solution together, like a temporary adjustment if she was facing debt. But given the girlfriend's lack of response and expectation that he should just cover everything, the author's decision to set boundaries by asking for a split might be justified.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the couple agreed to split rent and she was unable to meet her part, the author isn't obligated to cover it all. Relationships require mutual support, but that doesn't mean one person should bear all the financial load indefinitely. The girlfriend's attitude, expecting him to pay for everything while she handles her own debts, shows a lack of consideration for his situation. So the author's actions might be a result of needing to protect his finances, which is reasonable.\n\nBut maybe there's nuance. If the author was okay with covering her rent as a test, but she didn't take it seriously, then he's right to be upset. Alternatively, if he was being too controlling, but the text doesn't suggest that. He mentions he was able to pay, but it's straining his own finances. So he's not wrong for prioritizing his financial stability. The girlfriend's response of \"why do I have a boyfriend\" seems dismissive of his efforts and responsibility, which is unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He set a boundary when the balance became too one-sided, especially when it came to the main shared expense like rent. The girlfriend's approach was flawed, and the author acted to protect his own financial health. So the answer is B.\n"
