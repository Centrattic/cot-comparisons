Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong when they broke up and kicked their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to figure out whether the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the details again. The author mentions that the girlfriend moved in, and for six months she didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She cleaned sometimes but it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, initially split rent, but she stopped paying. The author ended up paying full rent, which caused their own financial issues. The girlfriend then said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. The author broke up with her, saying she's not helping with his financial problems while expecting him to cover hers.\n\nSo the main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believes the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend didn't contribute, leading to the author's financial strain. The girlfriend's reasoning is that since she's in a relationship, the author is supposed to help her, which he feels is unfair when it's causing his own problems.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, many people do have different views on splitting expenses in a relationship. Some believe it's fair to split equally, others think it's okay for the guy to pay more. However, the key here is that the girlfriend was not contributing, leading to the author's financial stress. The author felt it was unfair to bear all the costs, especially when his own financial stability was at risk. The girlfriend's argument that it's a test for potential future emergencies is weak because the situations are different\u2014emergencies would require support, but ongoing financial irresponsibility isn't the same.\n\nLegally, if they were roommates, both parties would be expected to contribute to rent. If the author was the sole tenant, the girlfriend might not be legally obligated to pay, but ethically, in a relationship, there's usually an expectation of shared financial responsibility. The author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship due to this\u2014seems justified if the girlfriend was aware of the expectations and still chose not to contribute, especially after prior agreements. The girlfriend's behavior seems to take advantage of the author's willingness to support her financially without reciprocation.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid. They were helping with expenses before moving in, and when the arrangement changed, the girlfriend didn't hold up her end. The author's financial situation was negatively impacted by supporting her debts and bills, which isn't sustainable. The girlfriend's test argument is a bit of a stretch; expecting someone to take on financial burdens without any responsibility isn't reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship under these circumstances.\n"
