Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if he was at fault.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend moved in and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries much. Then when they moved in together, she agreed to split the rent but couldn't pay. The author ended up paying full rent twice, which put him in a tough spot. The girlfriend then said she can't pay again and the author kicks her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The author felt that while he's okay with paying most, there needs to be some reciprocity. The girlfriend didn't contribute as much as he expected, leading to the breakup. \n\nIn relationships, financial responsibilities are often a point of contention. If both partners are living together, splitting bills is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The author might have set the precedent early on by paying for most things, which the girlfriend might have come to expect. But when they moved in together, splitting the rent is standard. The fact that she couldn't pay her share might be due to her financial situation, which is a valid issue. However, not communicating better or not contributing at all could be a problem.\n\nThe author's anger and decision to kick her out after she couldn't pay again seems extreme. The girlfriend did mention her debts, so maybe there's a lack of understanding or communication from both sides. The author might have been in a tight spot financially too. The girlfriend's statement that it was a test is concerning because using someone's financial instability as a test isn't responsible. \n\nBut was the author wrong to break up and kick her out? Well, if they were in a situation where the rent was split, and she couldn't pay, maybe the author should have addressed it earlier instead of letting it build up. However, after multiple instances where she couldn't contribute, the author had a right to set boundaries. The final decision to end the relationship could be justified if there was a mutual agreement to split costs and she repeatedly couldn't meet her share. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been too harsh. Financial difficulties can be situational, and maybe working out a payment plan or open conversation could have helped. The girlfriend's attitude of relying entirely on the partner isn't healthy, but the author's response of sudden eviction might not consider her circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions might be seen as a last resort after repeated issues. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her test mindset are problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship could be justified as protecting his own financial stability. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground where communication could have been better. However, given the situation, the author's action seems a reasonable outcome when expectations weren't met.\n"
