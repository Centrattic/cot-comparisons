Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, looking at the details: The woman moved into his apartment in 2018 and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. She helped with cleaning occasionally. Then they moved in together, split rent for a while, but she couldn't pay her share in February and again this month. The author paid the full rent each time, which put him in financial strain. When he asked her to pay back, she said, \"Why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which led him to kick her out. She later mentioned it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. \n\nI need to consider relationship norms, financial responsibility, and communication. The author was paying for most things from the start, expecting some contribution, which he didn't get. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard, but she couldn't hold up her end. The author's financial stability was affected, and he made a decision to prioritize his own obligations. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning about the test seems problematic. Using a partner's financial situation as a test is manipulative and unfair. The author had valid reasons for being upset, given the financial strain and lack of reciprocity. \n\nHowever, breaking up and kicking someone out abruptly might have emotional repercussions. But in terms of right or wrong, the financial responsibility and the girlfriend's lack of contribution seem to justify the author's actions. The key issue is the imbalance in financial responsibility and the lack of willingness from the girlfriend to contribute. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to her not meeting her financial obligations, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
