Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation is that she couldn't pay rent, and he kicked her out. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, they moved in together, and initially split the rent. Then she stopped paying because of her debts. The man ends up paying all the rent, which puts his own finances at risk. He's frustrated because he's been covering most expenses before, and she's not contributing. When he asks for payment or repayment, she dismisses it by saying why have a boyfriend. He then kicks her out.\n\nHe argues that he's been paying most of the bills and she expected him to cover everything. She later claims she was testing how he'd react in tough situations. He feels it's unfair to bear all the financial burden, especially when their relationship wasn't balanced.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Financial responsibility in a relationship can vary, but there's a general expectation of shared responsibilities. If both are supposed to be contributing to shared living expenses, and one partner is unable to contribute, that can cause tension. However, the man didn't give her a chance to find a solution or seek help; he just kicked her out. That might be abrupt. But considering the ongoing pattern where she was not contributing and he's facing financial strain, he might feel justified. Also, her response about it being a test shows a lack of consideration for his situation, which could validate his decision.\n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility in financial matters and communication. If they couldn't reach an agreement on splitting costs, breaking up might be a result of incompatibility. However, the method of handling it (kicking her out immediately) could be seen as harsh, especially if there were no prior discussions about financial planning before moving in together. But given the context, he might have felt it was necessary for his own well-being.\n\nSo, while there's a gray area, the man's actions could be seen as a justified response to a long-standing imbalance. The answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
