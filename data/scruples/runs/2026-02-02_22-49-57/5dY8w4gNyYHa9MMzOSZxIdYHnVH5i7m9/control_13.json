Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if they did the right thing by breaking up and asking her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple was in a relationship where the guy paid for most things, and she occasionally paid. When they moved in together, they split the rent initially, but she stopped paying because of her debts. The guy ended up paying all the rent, which put him in a financial bind. He got angry and asked her to leave. She later said she was testing his reaction for a hypothetical emergency, but the guy thinks that's different.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility and mutual agreement in a relationship. The guy felt that while he was okay with paying for most things, there needed to be some balance. When she couldn't contribute, especially when they moved in together, he felt it was unfair. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nFinancial expectations are a big part of any relationship. If two people move in together, it's reasonable to expect that both contribute to shared expenses. If one person consistently can't or won't contribute, it can create stress. The guy here tried to compromise but eventually had to take full responsibility, which he couldn't sustain. \n\nShe argues it was a test, but that seems a bit dismissive. Testing someone's financial commitment without prior discussion might not be fair. The guy had to make a choice to either keep paying full rent or set a boundary. He chose boundaries, which could be seen as responsible, especially if he couldn't afford to keep covering everything. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately after she couldn't pay\u2014might be seen as harsh. Maybe he could have had a longer conversation or found another solution first. But considering the build-up of the situation and his financial strain, his actions might be understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a role. She should have been honest about her financial situation from the start. He might have needed to set clearer expectations earlier. But in the end, when she couldn't pay and he couldn't sustain the financial burden, breaking up might be a valid decision. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the financial arrangement was fair and discussed. If they didn't have an agreement, his frustration is valid. Since he had to take full responsibility without her input, he might not be in the wrong. But if he was aware she couldn't pay all along and still kept her, that's a different story. The timeline shows a gradual buildup, so his final action seems justified given the circumstances.\n"
