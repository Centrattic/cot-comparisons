Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author mentions that he paid for most expenses, even though he believed in some give and take. The girlfriend moved in, and for six months didn't pay rent or bills. Then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. He paid the full rent, which put him in a bad financial spot. Now she's not paying again and he's had enough, kicking her out.\n\nHe's wondering if he was wrong to do so. The user thinks he's not wrong. So the question is whether he's in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nI need to consider a few things: financial responsibility in relationships, communication, and mutual agreements. When two people move in together, typically there's an understanding of splitting costs. If one person isn't contributing and it's causing financial strain, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. The girlfriend seems to have a different expectation, thinking the guy should pay everything, which might not be fair in the long run.\n\nThe author did try to communicate and compromise, but the girlfriend didn't follow through. Her not paying rent is a significant issue, especially when it leads to his own financial problems. The final straw was her inability to contribute and her justification that it was a test. That seems unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing a home, both parties should contribute to living expenses. If one can't, it's a problem. The author acted to protect his own financial stability, which is understandable. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
