Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved into his apartment in June 2018 and stayed rent-free for six months. Then they moved in together and split the rent initially. But she stopped paying her share, citing her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When he tried to get her to contribute, she refused, leading him to kick her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react to tough situations, like an accident.\n\nNow, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. On one hand, financial responsibility in a relationship is important. If both partners are supposed to contribute, especially when living together, it's fair for each to pay their share. The author was paying more than his fair share and this caused him financial strain. He had to prioritize his own bills, which is understandable.\n\nBut wait, did he handle it correctly? He kicked her out of his apartment, which is his property. If they were in a lease together, she might have the right to stay. But if it's his apartment, he might have the legal right to ask her to leave, especially if she's not contributing. However, relationships are complex. Breaking up because of financial issues is a personal choice. The question is whether his actions were justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems to be a red flag. She's not holding up her end of the financial agreement, and when confronted, she's dismissive. The author made a tough decision to prioritize his own financial stability. He might be in the right because he's taking control of his situation. However, maybe he could have handled it more constructively, like setting clear boundaries earlier on. But given the circumstances, his decision to end the relationship due to her not contributing financially might be justified. The test comment from her is also concerning, suggesting she might be using him for financial support without contributing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong. He's standing up for his own financial well-being. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
