Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. From the details given, the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't contribute much, and later couldn't pay her share. The author ended up paying everything, which led to financial strain for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibilities. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent was the norm, which the girlfriend agreed to. When she couldn't pay, he tried to work it out, but she wasn't consistent. The final straw was her saying she wouldn't pay anything, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test of how he'd react in tough situations seems like an excuse. The author's actions were about his own financial stability. If he couldn't afford the full rent alone and the relationship became unbalanced, ending it makes sense. However, maybe he could have communicated better or found another solution before asking her to leave. But given that she wasn't contributing and he's facing financial issues, his decision might be understandable. The key points are mutual agreement on financial responsibilities and whether the author's reaction was reasonable. Since the girlfriend didn't meet her part, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
