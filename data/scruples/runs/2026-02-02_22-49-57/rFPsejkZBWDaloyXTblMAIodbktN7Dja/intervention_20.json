We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe a bit early. The parents wanted to keep the baby safe from the flu, so they sent out a message saying they wouldn't be passing the baby around, just inviting the family to come over and hang out.\n\nThe family reacted strongly, saying if they feel that way, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They have a new baby, which is vulnerable, especially during flu season. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources say that the last few weeks are crucial for lung development and other factors. Maybe the parents are concerned about the baby's health. It's common for new parents to be cautious about exposing their newborn to illnesses, especially with visitors.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. They took offense to the message. Maybe they felt excluded or thought the parents were being elitist or distrustful. The message says the baby won't be passed around, but the family was welcome to come over. The parents are setting boundaries, which is reasonable. But the family's response to cut off Christmas if they feel that way seems extreme. It's possible the parents were trying to be clear about their needs without being pushy.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for parents to limit handling of a newborn, especially if they're not close to the visitors or if there's a health risk. However, maybe the parents could have explained better why they didn't want the baby passed around. The message mentions over-stimulation and flu, which are valid reasons, but maybe the family didn't take it well because they felt it was a rejection of them personally.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus the family's expectation to interact with the baby. The author's message is clear but perhaps could have been softer. However, the family's response of cutting off Christmas seems over the top. The parents have a legitimate reason to protect the baby, so they're likely not in the wrong. The family's reaction is the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
