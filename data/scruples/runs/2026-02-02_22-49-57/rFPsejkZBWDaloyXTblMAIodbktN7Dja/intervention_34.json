We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family was upset and even threatened not to come to Christmas if they couldn't pass around the baby. The author's message explains their reasons: they want to avoid overstimulating the baby and are worried about the flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some people might still be cautious, especially during flu season. The parents' concern about germs and overstimulation is valid, as newborns have underdeveloped immune systems and can get stressed by too much handling. So from a medical standpoint, the parents are within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The family seems to have taken offense. It's possible they were expecting a certain tradition or didn't consider the parents' concerns. The author's message was polite and explained their reasons, so it's not like they were rude. However, family gatherings can be sensitive, and some might feel excluded if they can't interact with a new baby. But the parents are the primary caregivers and have the right to make decisions for their child's well-being.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some families, holding the newborn is a big deal, especially for grandparents or close relatives. If the parents didn't communicate their reasons effectively, maybe there was a misunderstanding. But the text provided does explain their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially threatening to not come to Christmas. That seems more like an overreaction than a justified response.\n\nPossible angles to consider: The parents should have been more flexible, but the family's reaction is also disproportionate. The key point is that the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. Unless there's a cultural norm that prioritizes family interaction over health concerns, which isn't indicated here, the parents aren't in the wrong. The family might need to respect the parents' decisions, especially as new parents setting boundaries for their child's safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are justified in their decision for health and safety reasons, and the family's reaction seems unwarranted. The author explained their stance politely, so there's no indication of being an asshole here.\n"
