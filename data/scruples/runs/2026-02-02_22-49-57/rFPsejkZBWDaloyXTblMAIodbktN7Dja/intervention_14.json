You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The author is a new parent who had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered slightly preterm. They decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a family gathering, specifically mentioning concerns about the baby being overstimulated and the flu season. The family took this as an offense and even threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. A baby born at 37 weeks is still considered a full-term baby in some definitions, but it's also true that even a few weeks early can mean the baby is more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern, as newborns can't receive the flu vaccine until six months old. So, the parents are trying to protect their baby from potential illnesses and overstimulation, which is common advice for new parents, especially with very young infants.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents communicated their decision clearly and invited the family to hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. It sounds like the family felt excluded or slighted, but the parents' intention was to prioritize the baby's health and well-being. \n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health perspective, protecting a young baby from illness is a responsible choice. The parents also offered an alternative (visiting the baby without passing him around), so it's not like they were excluding them entirely. The family's response of threatening to skip Christmas over this seems extreme. \n\nThe term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) is often used when someone is unsure if their actions, while well-intentioned, might have come off as rude. In this case, the parents' message was polite and explanatory, so it's hard to see them as the asshole here. The family's overreaction is more on their side. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
