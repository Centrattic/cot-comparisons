We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is technically full-term, but maybe the parents are still cautious because of the early birth and flu season. Their message was polite, explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They invited the family to come hang out, just not pass the baby around. \n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are trying to protect the baby's health. It's flu season, so limiting exposure to germs is a legitimate concern. Also, a newborn, even if full-term, can be fragile. Overstimulation might be a reason to avoid too much handling, especially by multiple people in a short time.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's safety and the family's reaction. The parents communicated their reasons clearly and invited everyone to visit. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. \n\nIt's possible the family felt excluded or didn't understand the reasoning, but the parents aren't being selfish; they're protecting their baby. The message was polite and offered alternatives. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B makes sense.\n"
