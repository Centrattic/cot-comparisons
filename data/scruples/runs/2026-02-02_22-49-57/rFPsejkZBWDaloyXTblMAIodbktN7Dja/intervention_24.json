We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and the parents decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a family gathering to avoid overstimulation and flu exposure. The family took offense and mentioned they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents wanted to protect their newborn, which is understandable, especially during flu season. They communicated their decision politely, offering an alternative (visiting instead of passing the baby). The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe there's more context.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms around family gatherings and baby introductions. In some families, not passing the baby might be seen as rude or exclusionary, especially if they're expecting it as a tradition. But the parents have valid health concerns. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be fragile. Overstimulation and exposure to germs are real risks.\n\nThe parents' message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons. They didn't say the family couldn't come over; they just didn't want the baby passed around. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme. But maybe the family felt slighted despite the explanation.\n\nLegally and medically, the parents are justified in protecting their child. But social dynamics can complicate things. The parents might be seen as inconsiderate if the family felt excluded, even if the parents intended to be cautious. However, the parents' intent was to ensure safety, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer likely depends on balancing health concerns with family expectations. Since the parents communicated their decision and had a valid reason, they are probably not in the wrong. The family's overreaction might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
