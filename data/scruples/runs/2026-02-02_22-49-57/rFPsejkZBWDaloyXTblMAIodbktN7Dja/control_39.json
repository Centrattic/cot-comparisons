We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born at 37 weeks. The situation is that they wanted to avoid over-stimulation and flu exposure during flu season, but their family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. A 37-week baby is considered early term, which means they might have some health concerns compared to full-term. Flu season is a real risk, and newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more vulnerable to illnesses. The parents' decision to limit handling could be a precaution to protect the baby's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents communicated their decision clearly in a friendly and polite manner, stating their reasons. They even invited the family over to hang out, just not to pass the baby around. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems disproportionate and possibly hurtful. \n\nThe key here is whether the parents acted unreasonably. They had valid health concerns and communicated them respectfully. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or not taking the parents' concerns seriously. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's well-being. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or social norm that might influence this. In some families, not passing around a new baby could be seen as a slight, but the parents' explanation about health reasons should override that. The main issue is the family's response, not the parents' decision. \n\nTherefore, the parents are not in the wrong. They made a reasonable choice for their child's safety and communicated it clearly. The family's reaction is the problem here, not the parents' decision.\n"
