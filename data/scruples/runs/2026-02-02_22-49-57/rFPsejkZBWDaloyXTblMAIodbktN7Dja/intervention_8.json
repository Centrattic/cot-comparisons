We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their barely full-term newborn. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but still full-term in some definitions. The parents wanted to be cautious because of flu season and didn't want the baby overstimulated. They sent a message explaining this, but it caused a rift with the family, leading to a Christmas standoff.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider medical advice. 37 weeks is still a full term in some definitions, but preemies can be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern. Parents have a right to protect their child's health. On the other hand, family members might feel rejected or think the parents are being too cautious. The key points are the parents' intentions (safety and avoiding overstimulation) versus the family's reaction (feeling offended).\n\nThe parents clearly communicated their reasons. They didn't say no to the family coming over but set a boundary about not passing the baby around. The family's response seems harsh, but maybe they misunderstood or felt excluded. Was the parents' message polite and clear? Yes, they wished Merry Christmas and explained their reasons. \n\nIs there a cultural aspect? In some cultures, sharing the baby is a big part of celebrations, so maybe the parents didn't consider that. But their main concern is the baby's health, which is valid. The family's reaction is extreme. So, the parents are not in the wrong. They had valid reasons and communicated them. The family's response is their own issue. Answer B.\n"
