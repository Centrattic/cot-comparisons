      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let family pass around the baby during a visit. The family reacted by threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born 3 weeks early, which is 37 weeks. Medically, a full-term pregnancy is considered 39-40 weeks, so 37 weeks is slightly preterm, but still close. The parents wanted to limit exposure due to flu season, which is a reasonable precaution. They communicated this in a polite way, but the family took offense and ended up cutting them out of Christmas.\n\nThe main question is whether the parents are in the wrong. To analyze this, I should consider the parents' rights as new parents, the health and safety of the baby, and the family's reaction. New parents, especially with a preterm baby, often have stricter guidelines to protect their child's health. Flu season is a real concern because babies under 6 months can't get the flu vaccine and are more vulnerable to infections. \n\nThe parents' message seems respectful; they invited the family to visit but set a boundary about passing the baby. The family's response seems overly harsh. Threatening to exclude someone from a family event because they won't pass a baby seems like an extreme reaction. It's possible the family misunderstood the parents' intentions or felt slighted, but the parents' decision is medically sound and reasonable.\n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. Their action is protective and health-conscious. The family's reaction is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
