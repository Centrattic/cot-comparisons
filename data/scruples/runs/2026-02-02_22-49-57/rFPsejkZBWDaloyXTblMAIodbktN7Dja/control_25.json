      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, which is at 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season as a concern, so they wanted to avoid passing the baby around to prevent overstimulation and possible illness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical social norms around newborns and family gatherings. Usually, it's common for families to want to see the baby, especially during holidays. However, the parents have a valid concern about the baby's health. Premature babies, even by three weeks, might be more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is understandable.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' reasons: avoiding overstimulation and flu risks. They communicated this in a polite way, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and inviting them to hang out otherwise. However, their family took it as an offense and reacted strongly, leading to a threat of not coming to Christmas.\n\nThe parents are trying to balance health precautions with family expectations. The family's reaction seems harsh given the parents' legitimate concerns. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health perspective, they have a valid reason. Socially, they communicated their decision respectfully. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas seems overreactive. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's about respecting the parents' boundaries. If the parents clearly state their reasons and others take it as a personal offense, the responsibility lies more with the family's reaction. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're making a health-conscious decision. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
