We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but the parents decided not to let family pass around the baby because of flu season concerns. The family reacted strongly, saying not to come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. At 37 weeks, the baby is technically full-term, but some might argue it's still early. However, the parents are worried about the flu, which is a valid health concern. Newborns can be more vulnerable to illnesses, even if the baby is healthy. So the parents' decision might be based on precaution.\n\nThen, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of that seems extreme. The parents clearly communicated their reasons, and it's their right to set boundaries for their child's health. The family might be taking it personally, but the parents are prioritizing the baby's well-being. \n\nThe text message sent by the parents is polite and explains the reason, so there's no indication of rudeness. The family's response seems to overreact. So, the parents aren't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
