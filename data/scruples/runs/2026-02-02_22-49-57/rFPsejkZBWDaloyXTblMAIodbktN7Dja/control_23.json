      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born 3 weeks early, so at 37 weeks. They wanted to be cautious during flu season and decided not to let the family pass around the baby. Their message was meant to be polite, but it caused offense and even a threat of not inviting them to Christmas. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born 37 weeks, which is technically full term, but some sources say 39 weeks is full term. However, 37 weeks is considered early term. So, the baby might be a bit more fragile. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and the flu, which is a valid health concern, especially for newborns. Flu season is a real risk, and close contact can spread germs easily. \n\nThe parents sent a message to the family explaining their decision. The message is polite, mentions the safety concerns, and invites the family to come over and hang out with the baby. So they're not completely cutting off interaction but are setting a boundary. However, the family took it as an offense. The response from the family was harsh, threatening to exclude them from Christmas. \n\nNow, considering typical social dynamics, family gatherings can be sensitive. Parents setting boundaries, especially for a newborn's health, are often met with resistance if family members aren't used to such precautions. The parents are in a vulnerable position, wanting to protect their baby, which is a natural instinct. \n\nThe main question is whether their action was wrong. From a health perspective, avoiding passing a newborn, especially one that's early, is a standard precaution. The CDC and other health organizations often advise limiting handling of newborns to prevent illness. So, the parents are following medical advice. \n\nThe family's reaction seems over-the-top. The parents didn't say to stay away entirely; they invited the family to visit. The issue is that the family took offense at the refusal to pass the baby, which might be a cultural or personal sensitivity. However, the parents' primary concern is the baby's health, which is a legitimate reason. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often considers intent and reasonableness. The parents' intent was to protect their child, not to offend. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas is more extreme than the parents' refusal to pass the baby. \n\nTherefore, the parents are not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
