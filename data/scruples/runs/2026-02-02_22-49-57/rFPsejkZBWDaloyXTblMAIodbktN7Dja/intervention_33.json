      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is just slightly premature. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically a full-term baby, but still considered early enough to be at a higher risk for some issues. The parents mentioned flu season as a concern. Flu can be particularly dangerous for newborns because their immune systems are not fully developed. So, the parents' decision to limit handling might be a precautionary measure to protect the baby's health.\n\nOn the other hand, family members might feel excluded or hurt. They might not understand the medical reasoning or feel that the parents are being overly cautious. There's a cultural expectation sometimes around holidays where sharing the new baby is a tradition, so the parents' refusal might come across as a rejection of that tradition.\n\nThe text they sent was polite, explaining their reasons for not passing the baby around. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just not to pass the baby. The problem seems to be that the family took offense, possibly because they didn't agree with the decision or felt it was a slight.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents have a valid health concern, especially in flu season. The baby's well-being is a priority. The family's reaction seems to be based on hurt feelings rather than a valid point against the parents' decision. The parents communicated their decision clearly, so it's not like they were rude or dismissive. The family members might not have considered the medical reasoning or overreacted to the situation.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision to protect their baby's health, communicated it politely, and the family's reaction was excessive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
