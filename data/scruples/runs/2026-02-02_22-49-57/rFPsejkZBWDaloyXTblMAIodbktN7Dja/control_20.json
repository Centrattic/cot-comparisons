We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, which is 37 weeks. The family wanted to pass the baby around, but the parents said no because of flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but sometimes preemies can have more health risks. Since it's flu season, parents might be cautious. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just not pass the baby around. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas because the parents want to protect their baby? That seems like an overreaction. Parents have the right to make decisions for their child's health and safety. The message was clear and respectful, so there's no indication of being rude. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family felt left out or didn't understand the reasoning. But the parents are justified in their caution. The key point here is that the parents are acting in their child's best interest. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than a valid concern. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a reasonable decision to protect their newborn, communicated it politely, and the family's reaction is inappropriate.\n"
