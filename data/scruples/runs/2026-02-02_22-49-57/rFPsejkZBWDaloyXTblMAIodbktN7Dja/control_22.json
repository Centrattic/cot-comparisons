      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new parent not letting family pass around their 37-week-old baby during a family gathering, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The baby was born three weeks early but at exactly 37 weeks. The parents wanted to prevent overstimulation and flu exposure, so they informed the family they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family took offense and said if that's their stance, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The parents are questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' reasons: health concerns (flu season) and the baby's well-being (overstimulation). 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources say 39 weeks is full-term. However, even if it's early by a few weeks, the parents are concerned. They communicated their decision in a friendly way, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and explaining their reasons.\n\nNow, considering typical societal norms, new parents often set boundaries for their baby's safety, especially regarding health and stress. Flu season is a real concern, and limiting physical contact can prevent illness. Overstimulation is also a valid reason since newborns need rest and adjustment periods.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them they shouldn't come to Christmas just because they don't want to pass the baby around might be an overreaction. The parents made it clear they welcome the family to visit, just not to handle the baby. That's a reasonable boundary. The family's response could stem from feeling excluded or not respected, but that doesn't make the parents wrong for prioritizing their child's health.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the family felt they were being excluded from the celebration, but the parents didn't ban them from the event. They just limited physical interaction with the baby. Also, 37 weeks is full term, but even so, the parents' concerns are legitimate. \n\nSo, the parents are acting in their baby's best interest. The family's response seems extreme. Therefore, the parents aren't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
