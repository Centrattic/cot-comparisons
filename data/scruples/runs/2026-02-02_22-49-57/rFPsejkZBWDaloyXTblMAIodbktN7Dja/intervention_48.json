      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born at 37 weeks. The family was upset to the point of threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born three weeks early, which is considered a full term in some definitions but still a preterm birth. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and the flu season. They communicated their decision in advance, explaining their reasons. \n\nFrom a health perspective, preterm babies can be more vulnerable to infections. The flu season is a valid concern because even small exposures can lead to serious complications. Overstimulation is also a common reason for limiting handling of newborns, especially if they're still adjusting to life outside the womb.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. The parents made a reasonable decision to protect their baby and allowed visitors to come over but set boundaries. It's possible the family felt excluded or didn't understand the medical reasoning. However, the parents prioritized their child's health and well-being, which is a fundamental parental responsibility.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The parents communicated their decision clearly, gave a valid reason, and offered an alternative (visiting the baby). The family's response of threatening to skip Christmas is extreme. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The key points are the health concerns, clear communication, and the family's overreaction. The parents are justified in their decision, and the family's response is disproportionate.\n"
