We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is during Christmas, and the family is upset, even threatening to not come if the author won't let them hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is still considered preterm, even if it's just a week early. The parents are concerned about the flu season, which is a valid medical concern. Premature babies have weaker immune systems and are more susceptible to illnesses. So their decision to avoid passing the baby around is probably for the baby's health.\n\nThen there's the family reaction. The family seems to feel slighted, interpreting the parents' request as a rejection of them. But the parents' message was clear and friendly, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and interact, just not to pass the baby around. The family's response might stem from not understanding the medical necessity or feeling excluded.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child and the family's overreaction. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is their responsibility. The family's threat about Christmas seems like a knee-jerk reaction, possibly not considering the parents' reasons.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision with a valid health concern. The family's response is the issue here, not the parents'. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
