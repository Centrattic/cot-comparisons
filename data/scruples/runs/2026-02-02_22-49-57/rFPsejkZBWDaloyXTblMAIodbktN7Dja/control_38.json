      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The situation involves a family conflict where the parents decided to keep the baby from being held by everyone during Christmas due to flu season concerns. The family members were offended and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A 37-week gestation is considered a late preterm birth. These babies can face some health risks compared to full-term infants, though the risks are lower than those born earlier. The parents' reasoning is twofold: avoiding overstimulation and preventing exposure to the flu. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' health concerns for the baby and the family's reaction. The parents communicated their decision in advance with a message that was polite and explained their reasons. They allowed family to come over and interact but not to pass the baby around. The family's response was to threaten not attending Christmas if they can't pass the baby, which seems extreme. \n\nNow, considering medical advice, it's common for preterm or early-term babies to have restricted contact to prevent illness, especially in seasons with high flu activity. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for newborns, as too much handling can be stressful. The parents are acting in the baby's best interest. \n\nThe family's offense might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling excluded. However, the parents have the right to prioritize their child's health. The family's reaction of using Christmas as leverage seems unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's important to consider family feelings, the parents' request is reasonable. The way they communicated it was clear and respectful. The family's response is more about their own disappointment or lack of consideration for the parents' concerns. \n\nSo, the parents are not the asshole here. The family overreacted. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
