      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The family members took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The baby was born three weeks early, which is considered \"barely full term.\" Premature babies can have health complications, especially with their immune systems. Flu season is a valid concern because illnesses can be more severe for newborns. The parents wanted to protect the baby from overstimulation and potential illness.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in a polite way, inviting the family to come over but not pass the baby around. However, the family took offense and made a big deal about it, threatening to not attend Christmas. The question is whether the parents did something wrong here.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, it's reasonable for parents to set boundaries to protect their newborn, especially when there are known risks like flu season. The parents weren't keeping the baby from the family entirely; they just wanted to avoid passing him around. It's common for new parents to be cautious about exposing infants to large groups or potential illnesses in the first few months.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems excessive. Not being able to hold the baby might be disappointing, but it's a temporary measure for the baby's well-being. The threat of not attending Christmas because of this seems overreacting. Family dynamics can play a role here, but the parents' primary responsibility is to their child's health.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. The family's reaction is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the health rationale, the polite communication, and the family's overreaction.\n"
