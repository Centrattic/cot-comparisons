      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They told their family they wouldn't pass the baby around during a family gathering, mainly because of flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered early term, and while many babies born at 37 weeks are healthy, they can be more susceptible to infections. Flu season is a real concern, especially for newborns. So the parents' decision to protect the baby is medically sound.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The parents communicated their decision clearly, even inviting the family to come hang out. They mentioned concerns about overstimulation and the flu. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to skip Christmas over this. It's possible the family didn't take the explanation seriously or felt excluded. But the parents' priority is the baby's health, which is a valid reason.\n\nCommon scenarios like this often lead to family tensions. Sometimes, relatives might not understand the necessity of such precautions, especially if they haven't had similar experiences. The parents' message was polite and offered an alternative, so they tried to be accommodating. The family's response seems overreactive. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the parents are trying to protect their child, which is a parental duty. They didn't say the family couldn't visit; they just set boundaries for the baby's safety. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas over this seems more about feeling slighted than the parents being wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision based on medical advice and communicated it clearly. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings rather than the parents' wrongdoing. So the answer should be B.\n"
