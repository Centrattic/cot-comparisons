      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks), because they're concerned about the flu season. The family reacted by saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A 37-week pregnancy is considered \"barely full term\" because the full term is 40 weeks. However, even being born three weeks early can mean the baby has some health considerations, like a lower immune system. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, so they're more vulnerable to infections.\n\nThe parents sent a message in advance explaining their decision not to pass the baby around. Their reasons are to avoid overstimulation and flu concerns. They invited the family to visit, though. The family's reaction was to threaten not to come to Christmas, which seems like a harsh response.\n\nNow, considering if the parents are in the wrong. The key points here are the health of the baby, the parents' right to make medical decisions, and the family's overreaction. Medical advice usually recommends that newborns, especially preemies, avoid exposure to crowds and potential illnesses. The parents are acting in their child's best interest. The family's response seems disproportionate. They might be hurt or not considering the health risks, but their threat to cancel Christmas is extreme.\n\nThe text the parents sent was polite and gave a clear reason. They didn't say the family couldn't visit at all, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction of cutting off the holiday gathering seems like they're taking it personally, possibly misinterpreting the parents' caution as a rejection. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's reasonable to have boundaries for a newborn's health. Especially in flu season, many families do similar things. The parents aren't being unreasonable. The family's threat is more about their own feelings than the baby's health. So, the parents aren't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
