We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is that they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu exposure. The family got offended and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the user says \"barely full term.\" Maybe they consider it as still needing extra care. The family was invited to come over but the parents decided not to pass the baby around. The message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons: avoiding overstimulation and flu concerns.\n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective, protecting a newborn, especially one born early, is a common concern. Flu season is a real risk, and overstimulation can affect the baby's health. The parents are trying to balance family time with the baby's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems a bit harsh. The parents did allow family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems disproportionate. The parents communicated their decision respectfully, giving a reason. The family might be taking it personally, perhaps feeling excluded or not respected.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents made a reasonable decision based on health concerns, communicated it politely, and the family overreacted. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's health. The family's reaction seems more about their own feelings rather than any wrongdoing by the parents.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons, communicated clearly, and the family's reaction is their own issue.\n"
