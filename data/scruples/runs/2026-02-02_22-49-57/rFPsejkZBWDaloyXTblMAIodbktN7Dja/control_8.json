      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some sources say that 37 weeks is technically early full term. The parents wanted to avoid passing the baby around because of flu season and overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents sent a message explaining their decision, but the family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong here.\n\nFrom a health perspective, flu season is a real concern. Newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Doctors often recommend limiting visitors and handling for preemies or early full-term babies to prevent infections. So, the parents have a valid medical reason.\n\nHowever, family dynamics can be tricky. The parents sent a message that might be perceived as exclusionary. Instead of saying they wouldn't pass the baby around, maybe a more open invitation with conditions could have helped. For example, inviting people to meet the baby under certain conditions rather than outright refusing. But the parents did allow people to come over and hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to skip Christmas over this seems disproportionate. The parents are taking precautions for the baby's health, which is their right as caregivers. The family might not understand the medical reasoning, but that doesn't make the parents wrong. \n\nSo, considering both health and social aspects, the parents are not in the wrong. Their actions are protective and based on medical advice. The family's reaction is more about hurt feelings than any wrongdoing by the parents. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
