      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a baby born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They wanted to be cautious because it's flu season and decided not to let their family pass around the newborn. They sent a message explaining this, and it caused a rift where the family said they shouldn't come to Christmas. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born early, so maybe the parents are concerned about his health. Flu season is a time when viruses are more common, and newborns, especially those born a bit early, can be more vulnerable. The parents' message says they don't want the baby over-stimulated and are worried about the flu. They invited the family to come over but not to pass the baby around. \n\nNow, the family's reaction was strong\u2014they said if that's how the parents feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. That's pretty harsh. The parents are trying to protect their baby's health, which is a common concern. However, maybe the family felt slighted or that the parents were excluding them from a bonding moment with the new grandchild. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The parents have a legitimate medical reason to be cautious, especially with a preterm baby. Flu can be dangerous for infants, and over-stimulation isn't good either. On the other hand, the family might have expected to hold the baby, which is a normal reaction for new grandparents or relatives. Maybe the way the message was phrased came off as cold or dismissive, even if the intent was good. \n\nBut the parents did invite them to come over and hang out. The problem was just passing the baby around. Maybe the family felt that not being allowed to hold the baby was a big deal, especially if they were looking forward to it. However, the parents made it clear that their priority was the baby's health and well-being. \n\nIn terms of medical advice, 37 weeks is considered full term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks is early term and the baby might still need extra care. So the parents are justified in their caution. The family's reaction seems a bit extreme. They're threatening to exclude the parents from Christmas over a health precaution. That's a big deal and seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author probably isn't. They have a valid reason to protect their baby. The family's response is more about their own feelings than the baby's health. Therefore, the author is not the asshole here.\n"
