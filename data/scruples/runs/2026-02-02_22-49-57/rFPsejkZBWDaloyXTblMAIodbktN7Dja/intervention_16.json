We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is that the parents wanted to be cautious because it's flu season and the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe they're being extra careful. They sent out a message explaining they wouldn't be passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. Then the family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know others' opinions. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A newborn, even if born at 37 weeks, is still a new life, and parents often worry about their health. Flu season is a real concern; viruses can be dangerous for infants. Overstimulation is also a valid reason because babies need time to adjust. So the parents' decision is about protecting their child's health and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel offended because they expected to hold the baby. Maybe they didn't realize how important the parents' decision was. The way the message was phrased might have come off as dismissive or excluding, even if the parents' intention was to be cautious. However, the parents are within their rights to set boundaries for their child's safety.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They made a decision based on their child's health and safety. Even if the family took it the wrong way, the parents' priority is their baby. The problem here is communication. The message might not have been clear enough, or maybe the family didn't take the explanation seriously. But the parents aren't being malicious; they're being protective. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The family's reaction is more about their own expectations and perhaps misunderstanding rather than the parents being at fault.\n"
