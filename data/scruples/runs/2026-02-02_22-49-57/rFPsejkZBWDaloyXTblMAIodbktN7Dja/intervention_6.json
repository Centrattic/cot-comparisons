We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their almost full-term newborn. The situation involves a baby born 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely preterm. The parents wanted to prevent overstimulation and flu exposure, so they set boundaries. The family took offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. They mention flu season as a concern. It's a valid health precaution to limit exposure, especially for a newborn. Even though the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is close to full term, some parents might still be cautious. Overstimulation is another point; newborns need quiet and rest, so limiting handling makes sense. The parents also invited the family to come over for just hanging out, not handling the baby, which shows they still wanted to celebrate together.\n\nOn the other side, the family's reaction seems harsh. The threat to exclude them from Christmas over this seems like an overreaction. The parents communicated their decision politely, using \"we\" to show they're making a joint decision and inviting the family over. The family's response of \"then you shouldn't come to Christmas\" is extreme and dismissive. It's possible they didn't take into account the parents' health concerns or the baby's needs.\n\nPublic health guidelines often recommend that newborns be protected from crowds and people who are sick, especially during flu season. So the parents' actions align with common advice. While 37 weeks is not considered a high-risk preterm birth, the parents have the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health. The family's reaction might stem from a misunderstanding or not taking the parents' concerns seriously enough.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, setting boundaries, especially when it's about a newborn's health, is usually accepted. The key is how it's communicated. The parents did it respectfully and offered an alternative (visiting instead of handling the baby). The family's response seems to prioritize their own feelings over the parents' medical judgment. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the parents are not in the wrong. They had valid reasons and communicated them clearly. The family overreacted. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
