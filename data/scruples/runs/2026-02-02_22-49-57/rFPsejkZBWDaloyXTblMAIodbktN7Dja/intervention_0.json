We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The family got offended and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they don't pass the baby. The author sent a message explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and flu season concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. A 37-week baby is considered preterm, though it's late preterm. These babies can have more health risks, like respiratory issues or a weaker immune system. The parents might have valid medical concerns, especially during flu season. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they expected the baby to be passed around, which is a common tradition in some families. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' reasons: safety and health of the baby. They communicated their decision in advance and invited the family to visit. The family took it as a personal offense, which might be unreasonable. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. \n\nHowever, cultural or family expectations could play a role. If passing the baby is a tradition, some family members might feel excluded or that they're not being welcomed. But the parents' responsibility is to their child first. The message the author sent was polite and explained their reasoning, which is important. They didn't say \"no\" outright but offered an alternative. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They made a reasonable decision based on medical concerns and clearly communicated it. The family's response seems overly emotional and possibly not considering the parents' valid reasons. So the answer is B for No.\n"
