      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The context is that they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and protect him from the flu during the holidays. Their family took it as an offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born three weeks early, but at 37 weeks, which is technically full-term. However, some people might still consider that slightly early. The parents wanted to keep the baby from being overstimulated and to avoid potential flu exposure. They communicated this to their family in a polite way, saying they didn't want the baby passed around but that the family could come over. The family reacted negatively, leading to a possible Christmas conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no). \n\nConsiderations: \n1. The parents' concerns are valid. A 37-week baby might be more delicate, and flu season is a real risk. Overstimulation is a common concern for newborns.\n2. The parents communicated their wishes clearly and offered an alternative (family can come over but not pass the baby around). That's reasonable.\n3. The family's reaction seems harsh. Taking the parents' request as a personal offense instead of respecting their wishes could be the family's issue.\n4. Cultural or family expectations might play a role. Some families might expect to hold the newborn during gatherings, but the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health and well-being.\n\nPossible arguments against the parents: Maybe the family felt excluded or that they weren't trusted. However, the parents are the ones responsible for the baby's care. Their decision is in the baby's best interest.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often side with parents who set boundaries for their child's health. The parents are not being unreasonable. The family's threat to skip Christmas seems like an overreaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
