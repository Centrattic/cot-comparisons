      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, which was born three weeks early. The situation led to the family threatening not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe the parents are being cautious because of flu season. The parents sent a message explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. But the family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the parents' decision is about the health and safety of their newborn, especially during flu season. They're being proactive to avoid potential health risks. The family's reaction is to threaten exclusion from a family event, which is a strong response. \n\nIs the parents' request reasonable? Newborns, even full-term, have underdeveloped immune systems. Flu season is a real concern. Preventing strangers from handling the baby to avoid illness is a common precaution. Overstimulation is another valid concern for newborns, so limiting handling could be for the baby's comfort. \n\nThe family's response seems to be more about feeling slighted or not respected. The parents didn't say no to the family coming over, just that they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family took it as a personal offense and used Christmas as leverage. That seems harsh and possibly inconsiderate of the parents' needs. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries with their baby's health. Refusing to have others hold the baby, especially in public health concerns, is not unusual. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or expecting that family traditions (like holding the baby) take precedence over health concerns. However, the parents have the right to make decisions about their child's health. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are prioritizing their baby's well-being, which is a valid and responsible choice. The family's response is unreasonable and possibly disrespectful of the parents' decision.\n"
