We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted about not letting their family hold their nearly full-term newborn is in the wrong. The situation is that the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely preterm. The parents decided not to pass the baby around during a family gathering, especially during flu season, to protect the baby's health. But the family took it as an offense and even mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. 37 weeks is technically a full-term baby, but some consider it early term. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and illness. They communicated their decision clearly in a text, explaining their reasons. However, the family reacted negatively, suggesting that the parents are being exclusionary.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate if their actions were reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a newborn from potential illnesses, especially during flu season, is a common and responsible practice. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so limiting exposure to germs is advised. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for infants, as too much handling can stress them out.\n\nHowever, the family might feel excluded or think the parents are being rude. But the parents did invite them to come over and interact, just not to pass the baby around. The text message seems polite and explains the reasons, so the parents aren't being inconsiderate. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially threatening to not come to Christmas. That's a strong response to a health precaution.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while family gatherings can be sensitive, the health and safety of a newborn should be a priority. The parents are not refusing interaction entirely; they're just managing how the baby is handled. It's a reasonable boundary. The family's response might stem from misunderstanding or taking offense where it's not intended.\n\nTherefore, the parents are not in the wrong. Their decision is based on valid health concerns and they communicated it clearly. The family's reaction is disproportionate. So the answer should be B.\n"
