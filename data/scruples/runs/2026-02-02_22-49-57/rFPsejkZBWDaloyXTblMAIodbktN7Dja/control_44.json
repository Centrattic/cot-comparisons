You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family deciding not to let others pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during flu season. They sent a message explaining their decision, but it led to the family being told they shouldn't come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks is considered \"early term\" and might have slightly higher risks compared to 39-40 weeks. However, the parents are concerned about flu season and overstimulation. Their intention is to keep the baby safe, which is a common parental instinct. They\u2019re not refusing visitors but just not allowing physical contact with the baby.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Cutting off Christmas plans because the parents set boundaries for their child's safety could be seen as overreacting. The parents are making clear decisions for their child's health, which is their right. The family's response might stem from misunderstanding or taking it personally, thinking the parents don't want them there, when it's actually about the baby's well-being.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they communicated their decision respectfully and made it clear that the family is welcome to visit, then they\u2019re not being unreasonable. The problem lies more with the family's interpretation and their ultimatum. The parents are prioritizing their baby's health, which is a valid concern, especially during flu season. There's no indication that they're being inconsiderate beyond necessary precautions.\n\nSo, likely the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are making a responsible choice for their child, and the family's reaction is disproportionate. The parents should not have to feel guilty for protecting their newborn.\n"
