We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is that they sent a message explaining they wouldn't pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risk, and the family took offense, leading to a Christmas standoff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is considered full term, but still a bit early. Flu season is a real concern, as newborns can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Parents might want to limit exposure for health reasons. It's common for parents to set boundaries with newborns, especially in the first few weeks.\n\nThen the family's reaction seems a bit harsh. The parents didn't say no visit, just not to pass the baby around. The family took it as a personal offense, which could stem from not understanding the medical concerns or feeling excluded. But the parents are within their rights to prioritize their child's health and their own comfort level.\n\nThe message the parents sent was polite and explained the reasons. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby. So there's no indication of rudeness or unnecessary exclusion. The family's response of threatening to not attend Christmas seems excessive and not considering the parents' legitimate concerns.\n\nIn similar situations, it's generally accepted that new parents can set boundaries, especially with health considerations. The key points are the parents' right to protect their child's health and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being unreasonable here. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're justified in their decision for health and safety, especially given the flu season and the baby's premature birth. The family's reaction is the real issue here.\n"
