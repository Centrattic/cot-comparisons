We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The situation is that they told the family they wouldn't pass the baby around during a family gathering, probably to protect him from the flu. But the family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks are considered early term. These babies might still need extra care because their lungs and other systems are still developing. Flu season is a real concern because babies under six months can't get the flu vaccine, so they're more vulnerable. So the parents' decision to limit contact for the baby's safety seems reasonable.\n\nBut the family reacted negatively, leading to a Christmas conflict. The parents probably wanted to avoid overstimulation and germs. They made it clear they don't want the baby passed around, but still invited the family to hang out. The problem is the family felt offended. Maybe they felt excluded or not trusted to handle the baby, or thought the parents were being overly cautious.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, they have a valid reason to protect their child's health. The message was polite and explained the reasons. However, maybe the parents could have found a middle ground, like allowing brief, supervised contact instead of an outright ban. But the family's reaction seems excessive. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing the baby's health. The family's threat about Christmas seems like an overreaction. So the parents are not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
