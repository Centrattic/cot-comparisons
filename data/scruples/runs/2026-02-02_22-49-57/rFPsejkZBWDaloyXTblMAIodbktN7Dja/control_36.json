You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family members pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe the parents still wanted to be cautious because of the flu season. The parents sent a message explaining that they wouldn't be passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risk. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' concerns for the baby's health and the family's reaction. The parents are trying to protect their newborn, which is a common concern for new parents. However, the family might feel excluded or not considered by the parents' decision. \n\nI should consider medical advice. At 37 weeks, the baby is technically full term, but some sources say babies born at 37-38 weeks are considered \"early term\" and might have a slightly higher risk compared to 39 weeks. However, the flu season is a real concern for infants, as they can't get the flu vaccine until six months old. So the parents' caution makes sense medically.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents made a clear, polite explanation. The family response of threatening to skip Christmas is extreme. The parents are not preventing the family from seeing the baby; they're just not passing him around. The family could still visit and interact with the baby in a controlled way.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person had a reasonable justification and if the other party overreacted. Here, the parents had valid health concerns and communicated them politely. The family's response was disproportionate. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
