      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks early. The family got offended and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but still considered early. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation. It's common for parents to have these precautions, especially with a preterm baby. They might be trying to protect the baby from illnesses and stress.\n\nThen there's the social side. Family gatherings can be important, and the parents' message might have been perceived as excluding the family. The parents might not have realized how sensitive the family was to this request. Maybe they didn't phrase it in a more inclusive or empathetic way, leading to misunderstandings.\n\nBut the key here is whether the parents' actions are justified. They are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a valid concern. Flu season poses real risks to infants, and avoiding exposure is a responsible decision. Overstimulation is also a common issue for newborns, especially in large family settings.\n\nHowever, the way they communicated it could be a factor. The text says they \"let the family know we would be passing him around,\" but if the family was expecting to hold the baby and it's denied, that could lead to hurt feelings. Maybe the parents could have offered alternatives, like a specific time for visitors or explaining the baby's needs more thoroughly.\n\nThe family's reaction seems a bit extreme, but it's possible they felt excluded or not respected. The parents might have miscalculated how the message would be received. But the main issue is the health and safety of the baby, which should take precedence. Unless the parents were being unreasonable or not allowing any interaction at all, they're probably in the right.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They made a reasonable decision for their baby's health, even if the communication could have been better. The family's response is more about their own feelings than the parents' actions being wrong.\n"
