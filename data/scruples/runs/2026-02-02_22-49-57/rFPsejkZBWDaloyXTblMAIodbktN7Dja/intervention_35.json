      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is that the family was upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some contexts but still early by a few weeks. The parents are concerned about over-stimulation and the flu season. They wanted to keep the baby safe and healthy. They communicated this in a polite way, saying people can come over but not pass the baby around.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. On one hand, family might feel excluded or think the parents are being too cautious. But on the other hand, the parents have a valid reason to protect their newborn. Babies born slightly preterm might have more delicate health needs, and flu season increases the risk of infections. The parents are setting boundaries to ensure the baby's well-being.\n\nThe text from the family response was harsh, using \"you should probably not come to Christmas\" which seems extreme. The parents' message was clear and polite, so they're not being inconsiderate. They're prioritizing the baby's health, which is a responsible decision. It's possible the family didn't handle the situation well, maybe overreacting, but the parents' intention was to protect their child, not to exclude people maliciously.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had good reasons and communicated their decision appropriately. The family's reaction seems more on them than the parents.\n"
