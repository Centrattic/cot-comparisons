We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe a bit early. The parents decided not to let family members pass around the baby during a family gathering, especially since it's flu season. They sent a message explaining their decision, but the family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're trying to protect their newborn from potential illnesses, especially during flu season. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so it's common for parents to be cautious. They also mention the baby shouldn't be overstimulated, which is another valid concern for a baby's well-being. Their message was polite and offered an alternative (inviting the family over to see the baby without passing him around). \n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this decision seems like an overreaction. It's possible the family felt slighted or not trusted, maybe thinking the parents don't trust them to handle the baby or are being exclusionary. But given the parents' explanations, their actions were based on health and safety. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's health, the flu season context, and the family's overreaction. The parents didn't refuse their presence entirely; they just set a condition for handling the baby. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nIn similar situations, people often prioritize the health of a newborn, especially when there are valid medical reasons. The parents communicated their decision respectfully, so they aren't being inconsiderate. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or not valuing the parents' concerns enough. \n\nTherefore, the parents aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
