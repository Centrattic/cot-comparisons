We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent deciding not to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. They texted their family ahead of time to explain that they're not allowing the baby to be passed around because of flu season and wanting to avoid overstimulation. The family reacted negatively, saying they won't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The parents are making a decision based on the baby's health. Even though 37 weeks is considered full term, it's still an early delivery, and the baby might be more vulnerable. Flu season is a valid concern. The parents are trying to protect the baby, which is a responsible action.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they won't pass the baby around is extreme. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their right. They're not being rude; they're being cautious. The family might be hurt or offended, but that doesn't mean the parents are wrong. The key here is the parents' intention to keep the baby safe versus the family's feelings.\n\nAlso, the parents invited the family over, so they're not completely excluding them. They just have a specific request about the baby. The family is taking it as a personal offense, possibly not respecting the parents' decision. The parents are in a vulnerable position with a new baby, and they have the right to make decisions they think are best for their child's health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
