We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some contexts but still a bit early. The parents sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks, but the family was offended and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically a full-term baby, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks is considered early term. These babies might still have some health risks compared to those born at 39-40 weeks. So, the parents' concern about flu season is valid. They might be protecting the baby from potential illnesses.\n\nThen, the social aspect. Family gatherings can be stressful, especially with a newborn. The parents are setting boundaries to protect the baby, which is their right. However, they communicated it as a message that might come off as excluding people, even if that wasn't their intent. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they felt left out or not trusted. The key here is whether the parents handled the situation appropriately.\n\nThe message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out. The issue might be that the family felt excluded because they couldn't hold the baby. But the parents aren't obligated to let others hold the baby, especially when there are health concerns. The family's response of threatening not to come to Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some families might expect to hold the baby, but others understand the need for caution. The parents are asserting their right to make decisions about their child's health, which is a valid parental right. The family's reaction could stem from misunderstanding or feeling disrespected, but that doesn't make the parents wrong. \n\nSo, the parents aren't in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their baby. The family's overreaction is their own issue. The correct answer should be B (No).\n"
