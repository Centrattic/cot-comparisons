We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let family pass around the baby to protect his health during flu season. The family was upset and threatened to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents sent a text explaining their decision, mentioning not wanting the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. The family took offense and cut off Christmas plans. The question is whether the parents are wrong for setting this boundary.\n\n37 weeks is technically full term but still early. Premature babies can be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern, and parents often take precautions. The text was polite and invited the family over, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems extreme. \n\nThe parents are prioritizing their baby's health. They communicated their reasons clearly. The family's response was to hold a grudge over a health precaution. That seems harsh. In many cases, family should understand health decisions, especially for a newborn. \n\nBut maybe some people might think that once the baby is born, family should be allowed to visit, so there's a cultural expectation. However, the parents are not keeping the baby a secret; they're just limiting handling. The family's reaction of cutting off Christmas is a bigger issue than the parents' decision. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are justified in protecting their baby's health, especially during flu season. The family's overreaction is the problem here.\n"
