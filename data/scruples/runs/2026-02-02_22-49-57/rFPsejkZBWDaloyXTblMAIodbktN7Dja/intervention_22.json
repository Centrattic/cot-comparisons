We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is during flu season, and they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby. The family reacted strongly, saying if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A newborn, especially one born a few weeks early, might have a more delicate immune system. Flu season is a real concern because even a common flu can be dangerous for infants. The parents are trying to protect their child's health. On the other hand, the family felt offended and took it as a personal slight, leading to a potential family conflict over Christmas.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents' right to make decisions for their child's health, the importance of flu prevention for a newborn, and the family's reaction. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family over but set boundaries. The family, however, took it as a rejection, which might indicate that they didn't take the health concerns seriously or felt excluded.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have the authority to decide what's best for their child. Their decision isn't just about the baby's health but also about avoiding unnecessary stress. The family's reaction seems extreme, possibly because they didn't understand the medical reasoning or felt slighted. However, the parents are not at fault for prioritizing their child's well-being. The family's response might stem from their own emotions or misinterpretations, but that doesn't make the parents wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They communicated their decision respectfully and had valid health reasons. The family's overreaction doesn't justify the parents being the asshole in this scenario.\n"
