We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the newborn was born 37 weeks, which is considered early, and the parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas. The parents sent a text explaining their decision due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The baby is born 3 weeks early. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some people might still consider it a preterm birth depending on the context. The parents are concerned about the flu season, which makes sense because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. Also, overstimulation can be a concern for new babies.\n\nThe parents' message was polite and explained their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe there's some family dynamics at play here. However, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. It's important to protect a newborn from potential illnesses and stress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents have a valid reason based on health and safety. Refusing to pass around the baby isn't unreasonable, especially with a preterm infant. The family overreacted by threatening to not attend Christmas. The parents communicated their decision clearly and respectfully. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a responsible choice for their child's health.\n"
