We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn son who was born at 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season as a concern. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, 37 weeks is considered full term, so the baby is healthy. But the parents chose not to have the family pass around the baby. The reasoning is flu season and avoiding overstimulation. That seems reasonable. New parents often have concerns about keeping their babies safe, especially with illnesses. \n\nThe family's reaction seems a bit over the top. If the parents communicated their reasons clearly and in advance, then it's their right to set boundaries. The problem might be that the family expected to hold the baby and felt slighted when denied. However, the parents' priority is their child's health and comfort, which is valid. \n\nThe initial text they sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out, just not to pass the baby around. So they weren't being unreasonable. The family's response of threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems like a disproportionate reaction. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, they have the authority to make decisions about their child's care. The family's insistence might stem from cultural or generational expectations, but the parents aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014no, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
