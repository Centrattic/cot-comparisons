      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, which was born at 37 weeks. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born three weeks early but at 37 weeks, which is still considered a full-term pregnancy. However, being early by even a few weeks can mean the baby is more susceptible to illnesses. The parents mentioned it's flu season, so they want to limit the baby's exposure to people to prevent getting sick. They also mention not wanting the baby overstimulated.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' stated reasons: health concerns due to flu season and avoiding overstimulation. These are valid concerns, especially for a preterm infant. They communicated this in a polite way, inviting family to come over and hang out but not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, threatening to not come to Christmas. \n\nNow, considering the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child. As a parent, you have the authority to decide what's best for your baby's health. The flu is a real risk, and even a few weeks early can make a difference in the baby's immune system. Overstimulation is another valid concern; newborns need rest and a calm environment.\n\nThe family's response seems to take the statement personally, which might be a cultural or emotional reaction. However, the parents didn't say they don't want the family to visit; they just have specific boundaries. The family's threat to not attend Christmas because of this seems disproportionate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially for health reasons. The message from the parents was clear and respectful, so there's no indication of being rude or dismissive. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than the parents being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. They communicated their needs politely and have legitimate health-based reasons. The family's response is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
