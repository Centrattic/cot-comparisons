      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family hold their nearly full-term newborn during Christmas to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family reacted by threatening to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but only by a few weeks. 37 weeks is still considered full term in some definitions, but some sources say 39 weeks is full term. However, medically, a baby born at 37 weeks is considered full term, but they might still be at a slightly higher risk for certain issues. The parents are concerned about flu season and don't want the baby overstimulated.\n\nThe parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family took offense and reacted strongly. The key points are health concerns and the family's reaction. The question is whether the parents are wrong for setting this boundary.\n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a newborn from potential illnesses is reasonable. Flu season can be dangerous for infants, and overstimulation is a common concern for new parents. The parents are making a reasonable decision to keep the baby safe. The family's response seems excessive. The parents didn't refuse visitors entirely; they just said the baby wouldn't be passed around. They invited the family to hang out, just not to handle the baby. \n\nIn terms of family dynamics, setting boundaries around a newborn is common. Many families understand the need for caution. The reaction of the family might stem from not understanding the health risks or feeling excluded. However, the parents are within their rights to make decisions about their child's health. The family's threat to not attend Christmas if the parents don't change their decision is more about the family's feelings than the parents' actions.\n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. Their actions are justified for the baby's well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
