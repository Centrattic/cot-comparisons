We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, which was born three weeks early. The context is that they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and reduce flu exposure. The family reacted by threatening to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but sometimes doctors consider 37-39 weeks as early or \"barely full term.\" Depending on the health of the baby, there might be risks of illness, so avoiding contact with people might be a precaution. The parents are trying to protect their child, which is a common concern, especially during flu season.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The family was expecting to pass the baby around, which is a common tradition during holidays. The author's message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons. However, the family took it as a personal offense. That's a bit sad because the parents are just trying to be cautious. But maybe the family felt excluded or that their holiday traditions were being ignored.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The key points are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus the family's expectations. Since the parents gave a valid reason and even invited the family to visit, it seems reasonable. The family's reaction of threatening to not attend Christmas seems extreme and possibly immature, but that doesn't make the parents wrong in their decision.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, avoiding exposure to a large group of people, especially in flu season, is a prudent move. The parents are not being selfish; they're being cautious. The family's reaction shows a lack of understanding of the parents' concerns. So, the parents are not in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
