We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who declined to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They provided a reason related to health concerns due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some might argue that being a few weeks early could still be a reason for caution, especially in terms of health. The parents are prioritizing the baby's well-being by avoiding potential exposure to the flu and reducing overstimulation. These are valid concerns, as newborns have developing immune systems and can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Overstimulation can also affect a baby's ability to sleep and adjust to the world, so it's a reasonable precaution.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision clearly and politely, stating that the family is welcome to visit but the baby won't be passed around. The family's reaction seems harsh and possibly misunderstands the parents' intentions. It's possible the family didn't take the health concerns seriously or felt slighted, interpreting the request as a personal rejection rather than a health precaution. However, the parents didn't refuse the visit or make any unreasonable demands; they just set a boundary for their child's safety.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. While some families might expect to hold a new baby, especially during holiday gatherings, the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. It's important to balance family expectations with the child's well-being. The key here is the communication was respectful and the reason was health-related, which is a valid justification.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? It doesn't seem so. They made a thoughtful decision based on medical advice (flu season) and the baby's needs, communicated it clearly, and the family overreacted. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
