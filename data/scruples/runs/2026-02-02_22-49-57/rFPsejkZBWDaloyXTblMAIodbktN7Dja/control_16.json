      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their newborn son born at 37 weeks, and they decided not to let family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered full-term in some definitions, but it's still early by about three weeks. Premature babies can have more health risks, especially with infections. Flu season is a real concern here. The parents are trying to protect the baby from potential illnesses and overstimulation, which are valid reasons.\n\nNext, the communication part. The parents sent a text explaining their decision in advance. They allowed the family to come over and meet the baby but wanted to avoid passing him around. The text was polite and gave reasons. So, they didn't just say no without context.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening not to come to Christmas because the parents want to take precautions with their newborn is extreme. Family gatherings can be stressful, but health concerns should be taken seriously, especially for vulnerable individuals like newborns.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the family is being overly sensitive, or that they want to bond with the baby. However, the parents' reasons are legitimate and they communicated clearly. The family's response of cutting off a holiday gathering is not a proportionate reaction.\n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their child's health and safety. The family's threat is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
