We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not letting family hold their preterm baby is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely preterm. The parents decided not to let the family pass around the baby because of flu season concerns and to prevent overstimulation. Their message was clear and polite, inviting family to visit but not to hold the baby. The family took offense and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nI need to determine if the parents are at fault. The key points here are the health of the newborn and the parents' right to make decisions about their child's care. Newborns, especially slightly preterm, have underdeveloped immune systems and are more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. Overstimulation can also affect their well-being. \n\nThe parents' message was a heads-up, not a rejection. They provided an alternative (visiting) instead of holding the baby. It's reasonable for parents to set boundaries for their child's health. The family's reaction seems over-the-top. Maybe they felt excluded or misunderstood the parents' intentions, but that doesn't make the parents wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They prioritized their baby's health, which is their responsibility.\n"
