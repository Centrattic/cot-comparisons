You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they have a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a visit, probably to avoid overstimulation and because it's flu season. The family took offense and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for this decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 37-week baby is considered preterm but sometimes referred to as \"late preterm.\" These babies can have more health risks compared to full-term (40 weeks) infants. So, the parents might have valid medical concerns about the baby's health, especially during flu season. It's common for new parents to want to limit the baby's exposure to germs and overstimulation, especially in the early weeks.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' decision to not pass the baby around, their stated reasons (flu season and overstimulation), and the family's reaction. The parents were clear in their message, inviting the family over but setting boundaries. The family's response seems harsh\u2014threatening not to come to Christmas because they couldn't hold the baby. It seems like the parents are trying to protect their child's health, which is a common-sense measure. The family might be taking it personally, not considering the parents' concerns. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that new parents have the right to set boundaries when it comes to their newborn's care. Visitors are usually expected to follow the parents' wishes, especially for medical reasons. The parents' message was polite and gave the family an option to visit and interact in a way that's comfortable for the baby. So, from the parents' perspective, they're acting responsibly. The family's reaction seems overblown and possibly dismissive of the parents' needs. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the family felt excluded or not trusted by the parents. Maybe they thought the parents were being overly cautious. However, given the baby's early birth and the flu season, the parents' caution is justified. The family's threat to exclude the parents from Christmas seems like an extreme reaction. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents made a reasonable decision based on their baby's health. The family's response is more about their own feelings of being slighted rather than the parents being in the wrong. So the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
