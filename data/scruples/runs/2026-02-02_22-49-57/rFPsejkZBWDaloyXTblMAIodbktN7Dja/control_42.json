We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents texted the family in advance saying they wouldn't pass the baby around because they wanted to keep him safe from the flu and avoid overstimulation. The family reacted negatively, leading to a Christmas cancellation threat.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are reasonable. The parents had a valid concern about the flu season and the baby's health. A 37-week preterm birth, while considered full-term by some definitions, can still have a baby who's slightly less developed. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a common-sense decision. They also gave a heads-up and invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. That seems considerate.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Taking away Christmas over a health precaution might be overreacting. The parents are not denying the family the chance to see the baby; they're just setting boundaries for safety. The text message is polite and explains the reasons, so there's no indication of rudeness. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different comfort levels regarding newborns. However, health and safety should be a priority. The parents are making a reasonable request, especially given the flu season. The family's response could be seen as not respecting the parents' decision, especially since the parents communicated their stance early.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest. The family's threat is the real issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
