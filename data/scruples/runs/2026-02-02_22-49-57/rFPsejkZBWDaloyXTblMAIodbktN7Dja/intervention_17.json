We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a given post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's son was born 3 weeks early at 37 weeks. They sent a message to their family saying they wouldn't be passing the baby around due to flu season concerns and overstimulation. The family was offended and said if they feel that way, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe some people might think 37 is a bit early? The author is trying to be cautious because of the flu season. The message was meant to set expectations that they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. The family took offense, leading to a conflict about attending Christmas.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Well, the main issue is about the decision to not pass around the baby. The author provided reasons: overstimulation and flu. Parents often have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. Even if 37 weeks is technically full term, there can be valid concerns about a baby's health in the first months, especially during flu season.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around is a strong response. It's possible that the family didn't expect the author to be so strict, but the author's actions are protective. The message was polite and gave the option to come over and hang out, which shows they wanted to be inclusive but set limits.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe in some families, holding a newborn is a big tradition. But the author is not refusing visitors, just not passing the baby. It's a reasonable request. The family's offense might stem from misunderstanding or feeling excluded, but the author's main concern is the baby's well-being.\n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision for the baby's health and safety, communicated it politely, and the family overreacted. However, the user's question is phrased as a hypothetical, so I have to stick to the analysis based on the provided information without external context.\n"
