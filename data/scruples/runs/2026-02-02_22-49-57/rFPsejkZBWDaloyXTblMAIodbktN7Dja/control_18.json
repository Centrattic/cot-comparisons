      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They decided not to let the family pass around the newborn during a visit, mainly because of flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. But their family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if that's the case. The user is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a \"barely full term\" baby implies. 37 weeks is considered full term, but some sources might say that late preterm babies (34-36 weeks) have higher risks. However, 37 weeks is just seven days before the typical 40-week pregnancy. The mother might be concerned about the baby's health, especially during flu season. \n\nNow, the reasoning here. The parents are making a decision based on their baby's health and their comfort level. They communicated this decision in a polite way, saying they hope the family understands and that they can hang out but not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to cancel Christmas if they don't get their way. That's a big reaction to a reasonable health precaution, especially for a newborn.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, families often have strong emotions around new babies, especially if they're excited to meet the child. However, the parents have a right to protect their baby's health. Newborns can be more vulnerable to illnesses, so avoiding exposure to people with the flu is a common-sense precaution. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for newborns, who need rest and care.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents communicated their decision in advance, gave a clear reason (health and stimulation), and extended an invitation for the family to visit. The family's response seems to take it as a personal offense, which might indicate they didn't take the health reasons seriously. \n\nIn similar situations, it's usually the family that overreacts who are considered the \"assholes\" because they prioritize their feelings over health considerations. The parents are making responsible choices for their child. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
