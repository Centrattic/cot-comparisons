We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a newborn born 37 weeks (which is actually full term, but the user says \"barely full term\"), and the parents decided not to let family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering because of flu season concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that 37 weeks is considered full term, but some people might refer to it as \"barely full term\" because it's just a bit before the average 40 weeks. The parents' message was meant to set boundaries to protect the baby's health and manage the stimulation level. The family took offense, leading to a threat about not coming to Christmas. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to determine if their reasoning is valid. The key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health and the communication of that decision. Flu season can be a legitimate concern for a newborn, especially if they're slightly premature. Over-stimulation is also a common reason for limiting handling of newborns.\n\nThe message from the author is polite, mentions the reasons (flu and over-stimulation), and invites the family to come over and hang out. It's clear and considerate. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening exclusion from Christmas over a health precaution might indicate an overreaction or misunderstanding of the parents' concerns. \n\nIn such situations, personal boundaries around a newborn's well-being are generally seen as reasonable. The parents are not being rude, they're being cautious. The family's response suggests they might not have taken the message seriously or felt it was an overreaction, but that's their reaction, not the author's fault. The author communicated their wishes appropriately, so I don't see them as being in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
