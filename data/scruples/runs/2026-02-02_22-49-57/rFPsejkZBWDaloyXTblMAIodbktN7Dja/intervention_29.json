We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and the parents deciding not to let their family pass around the baby because they're concerned about the flu. The family responded by saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. 37 weeks is considered full term in some definitions but very early full term. However, even a few weeks early can mean the baby is more delicate, especially in flu season. The parents have a legitimate health concern here. They're not just being paranoid; they're trying to protect their newborn from potential illnesses.\n\nNext, the parents communicated their decision politely, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and hang out but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas because they can't touch the baby seems over the top. Family gatherings are important, and while the parents might prefer to limit handling, it's their right to protect their child's health.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some cultures, handling a newborn is seen as a bonding experience, but health and safety should take precedence. The parents are not refusing entirely; they're just not passing the baby around today. Maybe the family felt slighted, but the parents' decision is reasonable.\n\nAlso, the parents didn't say no to the entire Christmas gathering, just the passing around. Their message was clear and polite, hoping for understanding. The family's response seems more about feeling offended rather than a genuine health concern. \n\nThere's no indication that the parents are being overly controlling. They're balancing family time with necessary precautions. The key here is that the parents are acting in their child's best interest, which is a valid reason. The family's threat seems like a disproportionate reaction. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
