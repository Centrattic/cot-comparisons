We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The author sent a message explaining they wanted to keep the baby from being overstimulated and worried about the flu. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The parents are trying to protect their newborn, especially since 37 weeks is considered preterm. Even though it's not extremely early, preemies can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern. So the parents' actions are based on health and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel hurt or offended. Maybe they interpret the message as the parents not trusting them or not wanting them to hold the baby. Family dynamics can be sensitive, and if the message wasn't received well, perhaps there was a lack of communication or a misunderstanding.\n\nThe key points here are the health of the baby versus family feelings. The parents' intention is to protect their child, which is a valid reason. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially since the parents are allowing the family to come over and interact, just not pass the baby around. It's a reasonable precaution. \n\nThe message sent was polite and gave an explanation. If the family still took offense, that's more about their reaction than the parents' actions. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're making a choice in the baby's best interest. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
