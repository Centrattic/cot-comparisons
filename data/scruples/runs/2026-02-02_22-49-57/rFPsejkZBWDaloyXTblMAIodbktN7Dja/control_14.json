      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, which was born at 37 weeks. They mentioned flu season and wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources might say that 37 weeks is early for a full term. However, it's still a week before the typical 40 weeks. So the parents might be cautious. Flu season is a real concern, and newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more susceptible to illnesses. Doctors often advise limiting exposure to prevent infections.\n\nNext, the family's reaction was to say they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel. That's pretty harsh. The parents' message was polite and offered an alternative (visiting instead of passing the baby around). They didn't exclude the family entirely, just set a boundary for the baby's safety.\n\nThe key points here are the parents acting in the baby's best interest and the family taking offense. While family traditions can be important, the health of a newborn is a valid concern. The parents didn't act out of spite; they communicated their reasons clearly. The family's response seems disproportionate, possibly misunderstanding the parents' intentions as exclusion rather than precaution.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a newborn. Overstimulation is a real issue for infants, so limiting handling can be necessary. The parents provided an invitation to visit, which shows they still wanted the family to be part of the celebration, just in a way that's safer for the baby.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the parents made a responsible decision for their child's health and well-being. The family's reaction was overly harsh. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
