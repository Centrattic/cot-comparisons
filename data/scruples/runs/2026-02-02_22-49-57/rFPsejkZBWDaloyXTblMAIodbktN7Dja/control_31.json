We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they should not come to Christmas. The text they sent was polite, explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the parents are justified. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, are still pretty young. The flu season is a real concern. Parents wanting to protect their baby is normal. The message they sent was clear and respectful, giving an option for the family to visit instead. The family's reaction seems harsh. They overreacted by threatening to exclude them from Christmas for a health precaution. \n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their child's well-being. The family's response was disproportionate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
