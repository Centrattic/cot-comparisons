We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they're worried about the flu season. The family reacted strongly, saying not to come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born 37 weeks, which is slightly preterm. The parents wanted to avoid passing the baby around to prevent overstimulation and flu risks. The family took offense and cut them off from Christmas. The question is whether the parents are at fault.\n\nI know that 37 weeks is considered full term in some definitions, but it's still a bit early. The parents have valid concerns about the baby's health, especially during flu season. Protecting a newborn from potential illnesses is common practice. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for new parents trying to adjust.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to cancel Christmas because the parents want to protect their child seems excessive. The parents' message was polite and invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. That should be reasonable. It's about setting boundaries for their child's well-being.\n\nHowever, maybe the family has different cultural or personal beliefs about family traditions. But even then, the parents' health concerns should be respected. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were protecting their baby, and the family's response was overly reactive.\n"
