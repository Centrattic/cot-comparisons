We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing family to pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is that the author sent a message saying they wouldn't be passing the baby around during a family gathering, and the family took offense, leading to a Christmas threat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the parents wanted to be cautious during flu season. Their reasoning was to avoid overstimulating the baby and to prevent potential illness. The message was clear and polite, and they invited the family to come over and hang out with the baby but not pass him around.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents made a reasonable request, and the family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and comfort, which is a common concern for new parents. It's not uncommon for families to have rules about handling newborns, especially when they're not fully term or during flu season. The parents didn't refuse the family from seeing the baby, just from passing him around, which is a different thing. \n\nHowever, maybe the family felt slighted because not passing the baby is a traditional part of the gathering for them. But the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. It's important to balance family traditions with the health needs of the baby. The parents did communicate in advance, which is a key point. They explained their reasons and extended an invitation, so they did try to be inclusive.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family didn't expect such a direct approach. But the parents aren't wrong in wanting to protect their newborn. The line between being considerate and being strict can be thin, but in this case, the parents' actions seem justified. The family's threat seems like an overreaction. So, the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
