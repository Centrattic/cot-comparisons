We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. 37 weeks is considered \"early term,\" but not as risky as preterm. However, the parents mention flu season, so they're worried about exposure. Their message was about safety and avoiding overstimulation. But instead of understanding, the family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems valid from a health perspective. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern. The parents are setting boundaries for their baby's well-being, which is responsible. The family's reaction seems harsh. Maybe they felt excluded or not trusted, but that doesn't justify cutting off contact over Christmas.\n\nHowever, maybe the wording of the message could have been softer. They said they're not passing the baby around, which might have sounded like a refusal without explanation. But they did mention overstimulation and flu, so the reasons are there. The family's response seems disproportionate. \n\nI think the parents are justified in their decision for the baby's health. The family's threat to not attend Christmas is unreasonable. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
