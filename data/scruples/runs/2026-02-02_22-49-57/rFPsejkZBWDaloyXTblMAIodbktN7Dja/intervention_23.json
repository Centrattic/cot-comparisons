We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early by some standards. The parents decided not to let family pass around the baby during a gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and mentioned not inviting them to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the parents' reasons. Preemies can have different needs, even if 37 weeks is close to full term. Some sources say that 37 weeks is considered early term and babies born this early might have a higher risk for certain complications. So the parents' concern about health is understandable, especially during flu season. Protecting the baby's health is a primary responsibility, so their decision to limit the baby's exposure might be reasonable.\n\nNext, the way the message was communicated. They said the family is welcome to come over and hang out with the baby but not pass him around. The phrasing might have been unclear or perceived as restrictive. However, the parents did express hope for understanding, which is a polite approach. The family's reaction seems harsh, as cutting off a family member over a health precaution is extreme. It's possible they felt excluded or that their traditions were being ignored, but the parents' right to make decisions for their child's wellbeing is key here.\n\nConsidering the options, answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense. The parents are prioritizing their baby's health, which is a valid reason. The family's overreaction doesn't justify the parents being wrong. However, communication could be improved to avoid misunderstandings. But ultimately, the parents are not in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their newborn.\n"
