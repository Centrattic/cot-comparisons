We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is just a bit early but still full term. They decided not to let their family pass around the baby because they're worried about flu season and not over-stimulating the newborn. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The parents are making a decision for their child's health and well-being. 37 weeks is considered early term, and babies born at 37 weeks are still at a slightly higher risk compared to full-term (40 weeks), but not extremely preterm. However, even a slightly early baby might be more vulnerable, especially during flu season. The parents are trying to protect their baby, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe family's reaction is that they felt offended and threatened to exclude them from Christmas. Their message was that if they don't want the baby passed around, they shouldn't come to Christmas. That's a heavy reaction. The parents' message was polite and explained their reasons. They even invited the family to hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. So the parents set a boundary, which the family didn't respect, leading to conflict.\n\nLegally, the parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child. Ethically, protecting a newborn's health is a priority. The family's response seems disproportionate. They're prioritizing their own desires over the parents' responsibility to their child. The parents' message was clear and respectful, so they shouldn't be in the wrong here. The family's threat to exclude them is more concerning. The parents are not being unreasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
