We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks (barely full term). They wanted to be cautious due to flu season and sent a message explaining that they wouldn't pass the baby around, but people came over. Then the family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents are trying to protect their newborn from potential illness and overstimulation. Flu season is a real concern, especially for infants, who have weaker immune systems. Being three weeks early might make the baby even more vulnerable. \n\nThe message the parents sent was clear and polite. They invited the family to come over and hang out with the baby but didn't want to pass him around. They explained their reasons. So, they're not being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around is an overreaction. The parents' main goal is the health and safety of their child. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially with a new baby. \n\nPossible angles: Maybe some family members felt excluded or didn't understand the medical reasons. Or maybe there's a cultural expectation that the baby should be shown to everyone immediately. But from a health perspective, avoiding passing the baby around is standard practice, especially in early weeks and during flu season. \n\nIs there any aspect where the parents might be wrong? If they had been more flexible or if there was a prior expectation that the baby would be passed around, but the text doesn't mention that. They did invite people over, so they're not completely shutting them out. \n\nSo, the parents are acting in the best interest of their child. The family's response is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
