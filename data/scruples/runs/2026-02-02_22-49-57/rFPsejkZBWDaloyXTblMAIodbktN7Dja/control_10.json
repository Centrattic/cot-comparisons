We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that their newborn was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering because of flu season and wanting to avoid overstimulation. The family members got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that 37 weeks is considered full term, but it's still a bit early. However, the parents are trying to be cautious, which is common with newborns, especially around flu season. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe there's some cultural or personal context I'm missing.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a quick answer, so I need to focus on key points. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and comfort, which is a valid concern. They didn't exclude the family from the event, just the baby. The family's response seems overly negative for a reasonable precaution. \n\nIn these types of situations, it's important to consider health guidelines. Newborns, especially those born slightly early, are more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern. The parents are making a responsible decision. Family members getting offended might be missing the point. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're being protective. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Their decision is reasonable and based on valid concerns for the baby's well-being. The family's reaction is disproportionate.\n"
