We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family is upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered early term. While some sources say that 37-38 weeks are close to full term, there's still a risk of complications. The flu season is a concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. So from a health perspective, the parents are justified in being cautious.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents wanted to set boundaries for their child's well-being. They communicated their decision politely, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, using a cancellation of Christmas as leverage. That seems extreme, especially since the parents were offering an alternative (visiting the baby at home). \n\nThe key points are the health risks and clear communication. The parents aren't being selfish; they're prioritizing their child's health. The family's response is overreacting to a reasonable precaution. So the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
