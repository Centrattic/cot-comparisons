We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is during flu season, and the author sent a message explaining their decision. The family then reacted strongly, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some sources say 39 weeks is full. However, 37 weeks is still considered early enough that the baby might be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, so they're at higher risk. The parents' decision to limit handling is likely for the baby's safety.\n\nThe message the author sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited family to come over but set a boundary about not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this seems harsh, especially since the parents are prioritizing the baby's health.\n\nThe key points here are the health of the newborn and the family's overreaction. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas over this seems like the bigger issue. There's no indication the author was being rude or unnecessary; they just wanted to be cautious. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
