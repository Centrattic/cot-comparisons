We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is technically full term, but maybe a bit early. The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu during flu season, so they informed the family in advance. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice. At 37 weeks, a baby is considered full term, but some sources might say that 37-38 weeks is early term and the baby might still be at slightly higher risk for certain issues. However, the main concern here is the flu season. Newborns under six months can't get the flu vaccine, so they're vulnerable. The parents' decision to limit handling could be protective.\n\nThe parents' message was polite and explained the reasons: not wanting the baby overstimulated and worried about flu. They invited the family to come hang out, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they felt excluded or that their traditions were being dismissed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Arguably, they're protecting their child's health. The family's threat to skip Christmas seems disproportionate. The key points are flu season, the baby's health, and communication. The parents did give a heads-up, so they weren't being rude. The family's response might stem from hurt feelings rather than valid criticism.\n\nPossible angles: Cultural expectations around family time with new babies. Maybe the family felt their right to see the grandchild was being denied. But the parents have a legitimate health concern. The line between being protective and being overly cautious is blurry here. However, the parents didn't refuse entirely; they allowed visitors. The issue is with passing around, which increases contact. So B, the author is not in the wrong. The parents are justified in their decision for health reasons.\n"
