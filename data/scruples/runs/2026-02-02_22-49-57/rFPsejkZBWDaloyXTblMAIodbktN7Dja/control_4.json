We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn son who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but just barely. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulation and prevent flu exposure, so they informed the family beforehand. However, this led to the family being upset and even a threat to not come to Christmas if they didn't allow passing the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the newborn. Even though 37 weeks is technically full-term, babies born early can still be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern, and parents have a responsibility to protect their child's health. Overstimulation is also a valid reason, as newborns need time to adjust and shouldn't be handled too much, especially in the first few weeks.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision clearly and invited everyone to visit the baby, just without handling him. It seems like a reasonable request. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas because of this seems harsh. The parents are not being rude or inconsiderate; they're making a health-conscious decision for their child. The family's response might stem from misunderstanding or not taking the parents' concerns seriously enough. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to make decisions for their child's well-being and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being selfish; they're prioritizing the baby's health. The family's threat is more about their own feelings being hurt, perhaps feeling excluded or disrespected, but that doesn't justify their response. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
