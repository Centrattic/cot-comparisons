We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The family got offended and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they don't pass the baby. The author sent a message explaining their decision due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A 37-week baby is considered full-term, but some might argue it's \"barely full term.\" However, the main concern here is flu season. Newborns are particularly vulnerable to infections, so keeping them away from large groups and potential germs is a common precaution. The author's message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons without being confrontational.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to exclude someone from a family event because they set a boundary for their child's health is extreme. The author is not being inconsiderate; they're making a reasonable decision to protect their newborn. The family might feel slighted, but that's their own reaction. The author's priority is the baby's well-being, which is valid.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some families, passing the baby around is a tradition, but that doesn't make it a necessity. The author offered an alternative: family can come over and hang out with the baby without passing him around. That shows they still want to include everyone, just in a safer way.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are responsible and considerate of the baby's health. The family's response is the issue here, not the author's decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
