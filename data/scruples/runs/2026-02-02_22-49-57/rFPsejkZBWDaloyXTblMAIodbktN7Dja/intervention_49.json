We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The parents sent a message explaining that they don't want the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu, so they're not letting people hold him. But then the family was upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is technically full-term, but being born three weeks early might still make the parents cautious, especially during flu season. They have a right to protect their child's health. Overstimulation is a valid concern for newborns, as they can get overwhelmed by too much activity and handling. So, the parents' decision is rooted in the baby's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents didn't say no to visiting; they just wanted to control the interaction. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas if they can't hold the baby seems like an overreaction. The parents are setting boundaries for their child's health, which is reasonable. The family should respect that decision even if they're disappointed.\n\nThe text message they sent is polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to come over. They\u2019re not being hostile but are clearly stating their needs. The family's response of cutting off holiday plans because of this seems like they're taking it personally rather than focusing on the baby's needs. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a new baby. People often expect some adjustments when a family has a newborn. The key here is whether the parents acted unreasonably. Since they provided an explanation and offered an alternative (visiting without holding the baby), it's hard to argue they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's reaction is disproportionate, and the parents are justified in their decision to protect their baby's health and comfort.\n"
