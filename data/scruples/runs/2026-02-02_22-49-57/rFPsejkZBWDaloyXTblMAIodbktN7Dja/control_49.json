      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not super preterm. They wanted to be cautious because it's flu season and didn't want to let family members pass around the baby. They sent a message explaining that, and the family got offended, leading to a possible Christmas feud.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 37-week baby is still considered full-term in some definitions, but others might consider it early. However, the parents' main concern is health, especially during flu season. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to crowds can be risky. The parents are trying to protect their baby's health by limiting handling, which is a common precaution.\n\nNext, the way the message was delivered. The text says \"we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today\" and explains the reasons. It's polite, offers an alternative (family can come over and hang out), and hopes for understanding. The tone seems respectful and considerate, not dismissive.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas is a strong response. It's possible the family felt excluded or thought their presence was being restricted. Maybe they didn't expect the baby's health to be a priority. But from a medical standpoint, the parents have a valid reason. 37 weeks is still a time when some babies might need extra care, depending on their health.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? In some cultures, family interactions with newborns, especially during holidays, are very important. If the family expects to hold the baby as part of the celebration, not allowing that might be seen as a slight. However, the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child should take precedence.\n\nAlso, the parents are not refusing to see the family. They are just limiting the baby's exposure. The family could still visit and interact without physical contact, but maybe they felt that wasn't enough. The parents are trying to balance family time with health concerns.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole (AITA), the parents are acting in their baby's best interest. The family overreacted, possibly not considering the health risks. The parents' message was clear and polite, so it's not their fault. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
