We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but slightly early. The parents sent a message explaining they won't pass the baby around because of flu season and not wanting him overstimulated. The family took offense and said not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They have a medical reason: flu season and the baby being born early. Even 37 weeks is considered preterm in medical terms, so the baby might be more vulnerable. The parents are trying to protect their child's health. Also, overstimulation is a common concern with newborns, especially in a large family gathering. Their message was polite, explaining the reasons and inviting the family to visit.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this policy seems extreme. The parents aren't refusing interaction entirely; they're just not allowing passing around. The family could still come over to meet the baby without handling him. The parents have a right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set rules about handling the baby, especially for health reasons. The family should respect that. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing the baby's needs. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems like an overreaction. \n\nSo, the answer should be No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons, communicated politely, and the family's reaction is the real issue here.\n"
