We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during a family gathering. The situation started when they informed the family in advance that they wouldn't be passing the baby around, citing concerns about overstimulation and the flu season. The family reacted strongly, leading to a potential Christmas fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A newborn, even if born at 37 weeks (which is technically full term, but some sources say 37-38 weeks is early term), might be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern for infants, as they can't get vaccinated until 6 months. So the parents are trying to protect the baby's health. Also, overstimulation can be an issue for newborns, especially in a large gathering. Their message was polite and gave an option for the family to visit, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nOn the family's side, they might feel hurt or rejected because the parents are setting a boundary. Cultural or family expectations around newborns might involve holding the baby, which could lead to offense if those expectations aren't met. However, the parents have valid health and safety reasons. The family's reaction seems extreme, threatening to not come to Christmas, which suggests they might not have considered the parents' concerns or felt they were being excluded. The initial text message was clear and offered an alternative, so the parents communicated their wishes respectfully.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the parents' reasons (health and safety) and how they communicated their decision. Since they provided a notice in advance and offered an alternative, their actions seem responsible. The family's reaction is more about feeling slighted rather than a justified health risk. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's well-being and setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
