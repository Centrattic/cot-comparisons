We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but still technically preterm. They might have some health concerns, especially during flu season. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health by not exposing him to too many people, which is a common precaution. \n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems a bit harsh. The parents did communicate their decision in advance and invited the family over for other activities. The family took offense, which might indicate they have different views on family traditions versus health precautions. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' intention to protect their baby and the family's reaction. The parents made a responsible choice based on the baby's health, so they're not in the wrong. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas because of health precautions seems extreme. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some people might be upset, the parents' decision is valid. The family might not understand the health risks, but that doesn't make the parents wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
