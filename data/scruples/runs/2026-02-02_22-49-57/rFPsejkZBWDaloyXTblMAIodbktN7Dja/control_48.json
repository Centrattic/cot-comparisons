      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during the flu season. The author sent a message explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu, but this caused offense and the family threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some definitions but still a bit early. The parents wanted to be cautious because of flu season. They communicated their decision clearly, saying the family could visit but not pass the baby around. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective. They have a medical reason to be cautious. Newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections. Flu season is a valid concern. Overstimulation can also be a problem for a newborn's health. So, the parents are trying to protect their child, which is a responsible action.\n\nOn the family's side, they might have felt excluded or not trusted with the baby. Maybe they didn't take the precaution seriously or felt it was an overreaction. Their response of threatening to skip Christmas seems extreme. However, family dynamics can be complicated, and maybe there were prior sensitivities or misunderstandings. But the parents' main goal is the baby's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the parents were wrong for setting this boundary. From a health and safety standpoint, they're justified. The family's reaction might stem from feeling rejected, but the parents aren't being unreasonable. They still invited the family to visit, just with certain conditions. The family's response seems overly harsh.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the parents could have been more diplomatic, but the message they sent was polite and offered an alternative. The family's threat is more about their own feelings than the parents' actions. So the parents aren't in the wrong here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
