We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had their baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but still full-term by some definitions. They told their family they wouldn't pass the baby around during the visit because of flu season concerns. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what's considered a full-term pregnancy. 37 weeks is actually the earliest for a full-term, so maybe the family thought the baby was okay. But the parents wanted to be cautious. The key here is that the parents were prioritizing the baby's health. Flu season is a real concern for newborns, as their immune systems aren't fully developed. \n\nThe parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons: not wanting the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to skip Christmas over this seems disproportionate. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some families, not being able to hold the newborn might be seen as a big deal, but health concerns are valid. The parents have the right to protect their child's health. The family's response is more about their feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions being wrong. \n\nAlso, the parents did inform them in advance, which is considerate. They didn't just suddenly refuse. The family's threat to not attend Christmas seems like an overreaction. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision for their baby's safety. The answer should be B, No.\n"
