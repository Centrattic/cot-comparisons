We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered a \"barely full term.\" They wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they informed the family they wouldn't be passing the baby around during Christmas. The family reacted by saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to check if 37 weeks is actually full term. I think full term is around 37-40 weeks, but maybe 37 is considered early. Wait, actually, full term is 39 weeks or later, right? So 37 weeks is considered late preterm. That means the baby might still be more vulnerable to infections compared to a full-term baby. So the parents are trying to protect their baby from the flu, which is a valid concern, especially since the immune system of a preterm baby might not be as strong.\n\nThe parents sent a message explaining their decision. They mentioned not wanting the baby overstimulated and worrying about the flu. Their message was in advance, so they gave the family a heads-up. The family then took offense and cut off the invitation to Christmas. The key here is whether the parents' decision is reasonable. \n\nIs there any indication that the parents were being rude or dismissive? The message starts with Merry Christmas and is informative, not confrontational. They invite the family to hang out, just not to pass the baby around. So they're offering an alternative (visiting) while setting a boundary. The family's reaction seems extreme. It's understandable that parents would want to protect their newborn, especially a preterm one. The parents are not saying the family can't come at all, just not handle the baby. \n\nPossible angles where the parents could be in the wrong: Maybe they didn't communicate this earlier, but the message was sent in advance. Or maybe the family felt excluded because not being able to hold the baby is a big part of their celebration. But from the parents' perspective, health and safety are priorities. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a vulnerable baby. So I think the parents are justified in their decision. The family overreacted by threatening to exclude them from Christmas. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
