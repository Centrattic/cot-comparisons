We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not allowing family to pass around their newborn son, who was born 3 weeks early (at 37 weeks). They mentioned flu season as a concern and wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to recall if 37 weeks is considered full term. I think full term is typically 39 weeks, so 37 is early but not extremely premature. However, the author's intention was to be cautious. Newborns, even full-term, can be susceptible to illnesses, so avoiding contact during flu season is a common precaution. \n\nThe family's reaction was taking it as an offense and threatening to exclude them from Christmas. The author's message was clear and polite, giving an explanation. The key points here are the author's right to set boundaries for their child's health and the family's overreaction. \n\nIn such cases, parents often have the right to make decisions they believe are best for their child. The message was respectful and offered an alternative (visiting the baby without passing him around). The family's response seems more about feeling slighted rather than a legitimate health concern. \n\nPossible arguments against the author might be that 37 weeks isn't severely premature, but the author's reasoning is valid regardless. Also, cultural expectations around baby handling might play a role, but the health aspect should take precedence. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision to protect their newborn's health and communicated it clearly. The family's reaction is unwarranted. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
