We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn during Christmas. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is still considered full term, but maybe some people consider it \"barely full term.\" The parents decided not to let the family pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and because of flu season. The family took it personally and said not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The parents' main concerns are the baby's health and overstimulation. Even though 37 weeks is technically full term, some sources might say that the last few weeks in the womb are important for the baby's development. However, others might argue that 37 weeks is still considered full term in many medical contexts. \n\nThe parents are justified in wanting to protect the baby from the flu, especially if flu season is active. They're also concerned about overstimulation, which is common with newborns, especially if the family is large or the environment is noisy. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to hang out. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of a health precaution is a strong response. The parents didn't say they wouldn't see family at all, just that they wouldn't pass the baby around. Maybe the family felt slighted or thought the parents were being cold, but the parents' intentions were health-related. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural or situational nuance I'm missing. In some cultures, family gatherings with newborns are very important, and not allowing physical contact might be seen as a slight. However, the parents' message was clear and polite, so they're not being dismissive. \n\nThe key points are the health precaution and the parents' right to set boundaries for their baby's well-being. The family's response is overreacting. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid concerns, communicated politely, and the family's reaction is the real issue here.\n"
