      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but they decided not to let family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is just one week early, and while it's considered full term, some sources might say that babies born at 37 weeks are still at a slightly higher risk for certain issues compared to full-term babies. However, the parents are concerned about flu season and overstimulation. These seem like reasonable concerns, especially since newborns have developing immune systems and can be more susceptible to illnesses.\n\nThe parents' message was polite and explained their reasons. They invited the family over but set a boundary about not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible they might have felt excluded or not respected, but the parents' decision is about their child's health and well-being.\n\nI should also think about social norms. While family traditions might involve holding the newborn, respecting the parents' wishes should take precedence. The parents are in a vulnerable position with a new baby, and their primary responsibility is to protect their child. The family's response of threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the family misunderstood the term \"passing around.\" If they were expecting to hold the baby and the parents meant not letting anyone hold him, but instead just let him be in a controlled environment, that could be a miscommunication. However, the parents' message was clear in stating they don't want him overstimulated and worried about the flu. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. The family's response is more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions being wrong. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their right. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
