We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn during Christmas. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is early but not extremely preterm. The parents sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around because of flu season concerns and overstimulation. The family took offense, leading to a Christmas gathering issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. Early term babies can still be more vulnerable to infections compared to full-term infants. Flu season is a real concern, especially for newborns. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a valid reason. Overstimulation from a large family gathering could also be a factor, as newborns need rest.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel excluded or hurt. They might not fully understand the medical reasons or feel that their presence is being restricted. However, the parents did invite the family to come over and meet the baby, just without passing him around. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe key points are the health and safety of the newborn versus the family's feelings. In such situations, the well-being of the baby should take precedence. The parents clearly communicated their decision in advance, which is thoughtful. The family's reaction seems harsh; threatening to not come to Christmas is an overreaction if the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. \n\nI don't see any malice or unnecessary exclusion from the parents. They made a responsible decision, albeit difficult. So the answer is B.\n"
