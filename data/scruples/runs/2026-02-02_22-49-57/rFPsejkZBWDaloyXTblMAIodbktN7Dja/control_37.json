We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born early, even though 37 weeks is still considered full term by some definitions, but the parents are cautious because of flu season. They didn't want to pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risk. They sent a message explaining this. The family took offense and mentioned not inviting them to Christmas.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate whether the parents were wrong. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a common and responsible approach. New parents often have boundaries to protect their newborns. The family's reaction seems harsh, but the parents' message was polite and gave an explanation. They didn't exclude the family from the event entirely, just limited physical contact with the baby. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nIn terms of social norms, setting boundaries for a newborn's health is generally accepted. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're being proactive. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or feeling slighted, but the parents have a valid reason. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
