We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family hold their 37-week-old newborn during Christmas, which is flu season. The parents sent a message explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated or exposed to the flu, so they won't be passing him around. The family then threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they don't hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the parents are wrong. Medical-wise, 37 weeks is considered full term, but some sources say 39 weeks is full term. Wait, the post says barely full term. So maybe 37 is considered early but still full term. But the parents are concerned about flu season. Newborns are vulnerable to illnesses, so it's common advice to limit exposure. So the parents' reasoning is medically sound.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. They're upset that they can't hold the baby and are cutting off Christmas. The parents are trying to protect the baby, which is a valid concern. The user's message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's response was extreme, using a holiday as leverage. \n\nSo the parents aren't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason. The family is being unreasonable. Answer should be B (No).\n"
