You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering because they're worried about flu season and overstimulation. The family took offense, and it escalated to a point where they said not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that 37 weeks is considered full term. Wait, no, some sources say that 37-39 weeks is early term. So the baby is still considered full-term, but maybe the parents are being cautious. The parents sent a message explaining their decision, emphasizing safety due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The family reacted strongly, but the parents' reasoning is about the baby's health and well-being. Flu season is a valid concern, especially for a newborn. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to people could risk illness. Also, overstimulation can affect a baby's ability to settle, which is important for their development.\n\nHowever, the parents could have handled the communication differently. Maybe the tone of the message came across as dismissive or not considerate enough of family traditions. They might have been more specific about the medical reasoning, or maybe offered alternatives, like suggesting a more controlled environment for the visit. But the core issue is that the parents are making a decision based on their child's health needs, which is a valid parental right.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas over a health precaution might indicate they prioritized their own expectations over the baby's safety. The parents are not obligated to expose their child to potential risks. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their decision, even if the communication could be improved. The family's response is the issue here, not the parents' decision itself.\n"
