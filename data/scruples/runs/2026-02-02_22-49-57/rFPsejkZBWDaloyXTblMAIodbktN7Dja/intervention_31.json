      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The family was told in advance, but this caused an offense leading to a Christmas invitation being rescinded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby is born at 37 weeks, which is considered preterm but still close to full term (which is 40 weeks). The parents are concerned about the flu season and don't want the baby overstimulated. They informed the family beforehand and invited them to visit but set boundaries about not passing the baby around. The family took offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they don't comply.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, new parents often have valid concerns about their baby's health, especially if preterm. Flu season is a real risk, and limiting exposure to germs is a common precaution. Also, not passing the baby around is a way to keep the baby calm and not overwhelmed by too many people. It's responsible parenting to set these boundaries for the baby's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have felt excluded or that they weren't trusted. Maybe they were used to such interactions and didn't expect the refusal. The parents could have been more considerate in their wording, but they did explain their reasons. The family's reaction seems extreme, threatening to exclude the parents from Christmas if they don't comply with passing the baby. That's a harsh response to a reasonable request.\n\nLegally and medically, the parents are justified in protecting their infant. Flu can be serious for newborns, and overstimulation can affect their health too. The parents' message was polite and gave the option to visit but set clear boundaries. The family's response is more about their own feelings of being slighted rather than the parents' actions being objectively wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parents aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
