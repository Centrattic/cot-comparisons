We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some definitions, but still slightly early. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu season risks. Their message was polite, explaining their reasons. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Refusing to attend Christmas over not passing the baby around seems disproportionate. The parents' decision is about health and safety, especially with flu season. New parents often have valid concerns about protecting their newborn. The key here is whether the parents' actions were unreasonable. They allowed visitors to come over and interact, just not to pass the baby around. That's a reasonable precaution. The family's response of threatening to not attend Christmas is overreacting. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision for their child's health. The family's reaction is the issue here. Answer B.\n"
