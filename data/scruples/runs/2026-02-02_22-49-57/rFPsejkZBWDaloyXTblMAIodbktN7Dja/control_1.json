We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season and they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nHmm, first, 37 weeks is considered full term, but some people might still be cautious. The parents are trying to protect their baby from germs and stress. The message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems extreme. They should understand the parents' concerns. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be fragile, especially with flu season. It's about the baby's health and well-being.\n\nThe parents didn't say no to the family coming over; they just didn't want the baby passed around. Maybe the family felt slighted, but the parents had a valid medical reason. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems like an overreaction. The parents are not in the wrong here. They're acting in their child's best interest. So the answer should be B.\n"
