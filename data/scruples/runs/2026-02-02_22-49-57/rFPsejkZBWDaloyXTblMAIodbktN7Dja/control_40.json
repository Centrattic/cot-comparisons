      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their newborn was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They decided not to let family pass around the baby during Christmas, citing concerns about the flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered preterm but still within the range of near-term births. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) mentions that babies born between 37 and 38 weeks are at a slightly higher risk for certain health issues, including respiratory problems and feeding difficulties. So there might be some medical reason to be cautious, especially with flu season being a concern. However, 37 weeks is just one week before 38, which is the start of full-term. The line between preterm and term is sometimes a bit blurry here.\n\nThe parents' decision to limit contact to protect the baby's health seems reasonable. Flu season is a legitimate concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. The parents could be trying to prevent the baby from getting sick. Also, overstimulation is a common concern for newborns, especially in a large family gathering. Newborns need a lot of rest and can become overwhelmed easily.\n\nBut then, the family's reaction was to cut off Christmas, which seems harsh. The parents' message was clear and polite, inviting the family over and explaining their reasons. They didn't say not to come at all, just not to pass the baby around. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas because of this seems like an overreaction. It's possible that the family might be upset because they feel excluded or not respected. Some people might have different opinions on when it's safe to handle a baby, even if it's just a week early. Cultural or family traditions might play a role here as well.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents acted unreasonably. Given the potential health risks and the baby's age, their decision to be cautious isn't without merit. On the other hand, the family's response is disproportionately negative. The parents are making a reasonable request to protect their newborn, which is their right. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas is more about their own feelings of being slighted rather than a health concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are not in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on their baby's needs and health, and the family's reaction was excessive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
