We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (37 weeks). They wanted to be safe due to flu season and sent out a text explaining they wouldn't pass the baby around but invited the family to come over. But the family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's actions. The baby is considered full-term at 37 weeks, so maybe the family thought it was okay to handle him. However, the parents wanted to be cautious about overstimulation and flu risks. Their communication was clear: they're not passing the baby around but are open to the family visiting. The family's reaction seems harsh, using an ultimatum about Christmas. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. They have a valid concern about health and the baby's comfort. The family's response is disproportionate. The text from the author is polite and explains their reasoning, which shows they're not being inconsiderate but rather protective.\n\nSo the question is whether their decision to not pass the baby is reasonable. Since 37 weeks is technically full term, maybe some family members might not see the risk, but the parents have the right to prioritize their child's safety. The family's threat to exclude them from Christmas seems extreme. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
