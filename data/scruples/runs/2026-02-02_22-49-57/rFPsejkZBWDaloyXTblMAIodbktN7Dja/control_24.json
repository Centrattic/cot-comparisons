      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn son, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The parents sent a message explaining their decision due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term in some places, but maybe slightly early. However, the parents are concerned about the flu and overstimulation. They communicated their decision to family, who found it offensive and cut off the invite to Christmas. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering medical advice: 37 weeks is considered early term. Babies born at 37 weeks may have some higher risks compared to full-term (39-40 weeks), like respiratory issues or temperature regulation problems. So, the parents' concern about the flu is valid because newborns, especially those born early, have weaker immune systems. It's common for parents to be cautious about exposing them to crowds or sick people.\n\nThe parents made a decision to protect their child's health, which is a responsible action. They also provided a clear explanation, which shows they tried to be considerate. The family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas over this seems like an overreaction. Family gatherings can indeed be stressful for a newborn, and the parents are within their rights to set boundaries for their child's well-being.\n\nHowever, maybe the family felt excluded or thought the parents were being overly cautious. But the parents' priority is their child's health, which is a valid reason. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they are being protective. The family's response is more about their own feelings rather than the situation's merits.\n\nSo, in this case, the parents (the author) are not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
