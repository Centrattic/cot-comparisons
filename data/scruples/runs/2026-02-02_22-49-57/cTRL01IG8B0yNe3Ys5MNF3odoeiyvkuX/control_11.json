We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k together, next year he'll be making $100k alone. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. After that, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So their budget is pretty tight. The author gives about $125 a month, which is a significant portion of their remaining money, but his wife gave $200 in a week. That's a big chunk, especially since they only have $100 left until April 15th after her donation.\n\nThe wife admires his generosity and started giving too, sometimes giving her whole lunch or $10. But giving $200 all at once seems excessive given their financial constraints. The author is upset because they can't afford that, while the wife expected him to be happy. Now they're arguing and she's ignoring him.\n\nMoral vs. financial considerations: helping the homeless is good, but when it strains your own finances, it's a balance. The author's reaction is about financial responsibility, while the wife sees it as a moral duty. Both have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The wife gave a large amount without discussing it, which caused financial stress. The author has a right to be concerned about their shared finances. On the other hand, the wife's actions come from wanting to help, which is also valid. However, since their resources are limited, not discussing such a significant expenditure could be seen as irresponsible. The author's anger stems from financial strain, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, considering their financial situation and the fact that the wife acted unilaterally on a large expense, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The right answer should be B (No).\n"
