We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple's finances: they make $60k a year combined, paying $1200 rent and $500 in bills. After that, they only have a couple hundred left for everything else. They both have student loans to pay off. So $200 is a significant portion of their monthly budget. The husband gives around $125 a month, which he says is what he can afford. The wife gave $200 in a week, which the husband considers excessive given their financial situation.\n\nThe wife was proud of his charitable acts before, so she might feel it's important to contribute similarly. But she gave all the money she had in her wallet, which totals $200. The husband got upset because they were already tight on money after paying rent and utilities, leaving only $100 until April 15th. They ended up arguing, and she locked him out of the bedroom.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong for being upset? Well, he's concerned about their financial stability. The $200 could affect their ability to cover necessary expenses. On the other hand, the wife's actions are also about helping others, which is commendable, but maybe she didn't consider the couple's shared financial plan. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband's reaction is justified. He's not against giving, as he contributes himself, but the amount his wife gave is more than his contribution and strains their budget. The wife might not have realized the impact, or maybe she felt it was her choice to spend her money that way. However, in a marriage, shared financial decisions are usually expected, especially when dealing with significant portions of the budget.\n\nThe husband's anger might stem from feeling that she didn't communicate or consider the household's financial situation. On the flip side, the wife might feel her generosity is valid and that the husband is being too restrictive. But given their financial constraints, the husband's concern is valid. The wife giving away such a large sum without discussing it could be seen as not considering their shared goals. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily the asshole for being upset. He's concerned about their financial health, which is a legitimate issue. However, his response (yelling, leading to her locking him out) might not be the best way to handle it. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding the action of being angry, not the argument's escalation. \n\nGiven the context, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his reaction is based on financial concerns that are valid given their circumstances.\n"
