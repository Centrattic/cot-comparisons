We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Their combined income is $60k a year, and they have significant expenses. They have a tight budget, with only a couple hundred left after rent, bills, and student loans. The husband gives about $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. He's upset because they can't afford that right now, while she thinks it's a good use of the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is doing something kind, which is commendable, but the financial aspect is a concern. Their budget is already tight, so giving away $200 could cause financial strain. The husband feels that this is irresponsible given their circumstances. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her altruistic actions are justified, even if it means using money that's not strictly necessary. \n\nThe key factors here are financial responsibility versus compassion. The husband's reaction is based on their financial reality. They can't afford to give that much without affecting their monthly needs. The wife, however, might not have considered the impact of her actions on their shared budget. \n\nIt's important to note that the wife did mention she gives to homeless people, but giving all her wallet's cash in one week without discussing it with her husband could be seen as not considering their joint finances. The husband's reaction is about the financial consequences, not about the act of giving itself. \n\nIn terms of communication, the wife might have a point if the couple had discussed their priorities and agreed on how much they could both give. But since they didn't, the husband is within his rights to be upset. The question is whether his anger is reasonable. Given their financial situation, it seems valid. \n\nHowever, the husband's approach might have been harsh. Arguing and locking her out of the room isn't healthy. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the argument's handling. The main issue is the financial decision. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's anger is justified because their financial situation can't handle such a large expense. The wife should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
