We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The context is that they make $60k a year, have significant expenses, and the wife gave away $200 when they can barely afford their monthly budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is stressed about their finances because they have fixed costs like rent and student loans, and after paying those, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other necessities. The wife's action of giving $200 might have been a significant portion of their remaining money, which could affect their ability to cover monthly expenses. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was inspired by her husband's own charitable acts. He gives money when he can, and she started doing the same. She might feel that helping the homeless is a moral duty, and she might not see the $200 as a large amount compared to the need she's addressing. The problem here is a communication gap. The husband didn't realize the $200 was in her wallet, and she didn't consult him before giving it away. \n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship usually require mutual agreement, especially when it's a significant portion of their limited funds. The wife gave away the money without discussing it, which can be seen as irresponsible from the husband's viewpoint. However, her motivation was altruistic, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points are the financial constraints of the couple and whether the wife's action was a reasonable use of their resources. The husband's anger stems from the financial impact, while the wife's action is motivated by empathy. But since the money given was from their shared resources and not her personal savings, the husband's reaction is understandable. The wife should have discussed the amount she intended to give, especially when they're living on a tight budget. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue is about financial planning and communication. The wife's action was impulsive and without considering their financial plan, which the husband is justified in being upset about. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
