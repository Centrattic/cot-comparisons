We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The author makes about $60k a year together, with the husband set to make $100k alone next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. They have only a couple hundred left for food and necessities each month. The wife gave $200, which they consider a significant portion of their budget.\n\nHmm, the author is frustrated because they can't afford that. The wife, on the other hand, is motivated by her admiration for his charitable acts. She gave all the money in her wallet, thinking it's a good thing. The key here is whether giving away $200 is reasonable given their financial situation.\n\nFinancial planning in a relationship usually requires both partners to agree on spending, especially when it comes to larger amounts. The wife didn't consult him before giving away $200, which is a third of their remaining money. Even though helping others is commendable, the couple's financial stability is important. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the decision wasn't mutual and that it affects their shared budget.\n\nBut maybe the wife didn't realize the impact. However, the author's initial reaction was to be upset, and he communicated that. The wife's response of \"I outran you this week\" seems a bit competitive, which could be part of the problem. Both sides have valid points. The author isn't wrong for being upset about the financial strain, but he could have handled it better without being dismissive. Conversely, the wife should have discussed the donation with him first. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because financial decisions in a partnership need mutual agreement. The wife's action was beyond her individual control since it affects their shared finances. The author has a right to be upset about the sudden large expense without prior discussion. However, the way he reacted might be harsh. But the main issue is the financial impact, so the author isn't wrong.\n"
