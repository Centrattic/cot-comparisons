We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year together, with the husband set to earn $100k alone next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in bills, student loans, and have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses each month. So their budget is tight, even if they're expecting a raise.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which the wife admires. She's been doing similar things, like giving her lunch or $10 bills. But this time, she gave $200, which is a significant portion of their remaining money each month. The husband is upset because that $200 is going to stretch their budget thin for the next month and a half. They only have $100 left until April 15th after that.\n\nThe wife seems to have a different perspective. She's proud of her giving and even mentions \"outran\" him, which might indicate she's competing in how much they can give. Her reaction to his anger was to lock him out, which shows some conflict in communication.\n\nNow, considering both sides: The husband's frustration is about financial responsibility, especially since they have limited funds. The wife's actions, while generous, might not consider the couple's financial constraints. But then again, generosity is a personal value. However, when it's a couple, financial decisions should be mutual. \n\nIs the husband wrong for being upset? Well, he's responsible for their shared finances and has a right to be concerned when someone spends a large chunk of their limited budget. However, he might also be wrong if he's not discussing his giving habits openly, leading to a situation where both are spending without considering the other's perspective. But the key point here is that the wife gave away a large amount without discussing it, which the husband found problematic. \n\nThe wife's action of giving $200 might be seen as impulsive, especially when their budget is already tight. The husband's reaction could be seen as valid because they need to manage their finances together. However, if the husband hadn't discussed his own contributions first, that could be a point of contention too. But in this case, the wife's $200 donation is the immediate issue.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. His concern is about their shared financial stability. The wife's action was impulsive and perhaps not discussed, leading to tension. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
