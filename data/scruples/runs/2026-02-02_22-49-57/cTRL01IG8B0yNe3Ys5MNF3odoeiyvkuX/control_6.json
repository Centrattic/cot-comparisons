We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe couple lives in Chicago, makes about $60k together, with the husband expecting $100k next year. They have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred for food and other expenses.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he can afford. The wife starts giving too, sometimes her whole lunch or $10. The husband is okay with it and even praises her. But then she gave $200 in one week, which the author is upset about because they can't afford that. They only have $100 left after rent and utilities, so $200 is a big chunk. They argue, she ignores him, locks him out, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The wife's action of giving $200 is more significant than the husband's $125 a month. The husband probably thought she was giving smaller amounts since she had given $10 before. Now she gave a lot more, which is causing financial strain. The husband's reaction is about money they can't afford to lose. The wife might feel that helping homeless people is important, but the husband is concerned about their budget.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong to be upset. On one hand, giving to those in need is commendable, but if it's at the expense of their own financial stability, it's a problem. The wife might not have realized the impact of $200 on their budget. The husband has been giving $125/month, which they can manage, but $200 is double that, which they can't. So his anger is about the financial strain, not the act of giving itself. The wife didn't consult him, which could be an issue in their communication. Maybe they should have discussed their spending and given limits beforehand. \n\nBut the wife might not have intended to cause a problem. However, the husband's reaction is valid because their budget is tight. So the author isn't in the wrong because he's concerned about their financial stability. The wife's action was impulsive and without considering their financial situation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
