We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, the context: They make $60k together, $100k next year. Expenses are $1200 rent and $500 other bills. After paying bills and student loans, they have only a couple hundred left for food and other needs. So, their financial situation is tight.\n\nThe author gives about $125 a month, which he can afford since he says he gives when he can. The wife gave $200 all at once, which is more than double what he gives in a month. The author is upset because that $200 is a significant chunk of their remaining money, especially since they only have $100 left until mid-April. The wife seemed surprised at his reaction, thinking he'd be happy, but he felt it was irresponsible given their finances.\n\nNow, considering both sides. On one hand, giving to the homeless is a kind act, and the wife was following the author's example. She might feel it's important to help others in need. On the other hand, their financial situation is precarious. $200 is a substantial amount when they have such a small buffer. The author is concerned about their ability to cover essentials, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key point is whether giving $200 was irresponsible in their financial context. The author isn't against giving\u2014after all, he gives too\u2014but the amount his wife gave is more than they can comfortably afford. The wife didn't consider the financial impact, which the author found problematic. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, he's justified in worrying about their financial stability. The wife's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as not considering their shared financial responsibilities. However, the author's reaction (yelling, sleeping on the couch) might have been harsh, but the underlying concern is valid. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he has a valid reason to be upset about the financial impact of the $200 donation.\n"
