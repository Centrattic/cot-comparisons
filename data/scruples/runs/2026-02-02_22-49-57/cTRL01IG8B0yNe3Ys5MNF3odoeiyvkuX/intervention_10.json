We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for being upset about his wife giving $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year together, with the husband set to make $100k alone next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. After all that, they have only a few hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. So, $200 is a significant chunk of their remaining money each month. \n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month, which he can afford because he's careful with how much he gives. He gives based on what's left after expenses. The wife, on the other hand, gave away $200 in a week. That's double what he usually gives in a month. The key issue here is the amount relative to their budget. \n\nThe husband's reaction is about financial responsibility. They have a tight budget, and $200 is a large portion of their discretionary income. He's concerned about their ability to manage their finances, especially since they have student loans to pay off. The wife, while admired for her husband's giving, gave a lot more than he does, which he finds irresponsible given their financial situation.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that helping homeless people is good, and she might feel that the money is more needed by them. However, from the husband's point of view, it's a matter of prioritizing their shared financial goals and not overspending on discretionary charitable giving when they can't afford it.\n\nNow, considering if the husband is in the wrong. The question is about whether his reaction is justified. Since they have a limited budget and the wife's action significantly impacts their funds, his concern about financial management is valid. However, the wife's motivation is charitable, which is a positive intent. \n\nBut the problem arises from the financial impact. The couple should have a mutual agreement on how much to spend on such things. The wife didn't consult him about the $200, which might be part of the issue. The husband is within his rights to be upset about the financial decision, especially if it strains their shared resources.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her charitable acts are personal and that the husband is being overly focused on money. But since it's a joint financial responsibility, both should be on the same page. The husband's anger is about the financial impact, not the cause itself. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether it's acceptable to give that amount given their budget. Since the husband isn't against giving but is concerned about the amount, he's not necessarily wrong. The wife should have discussed it with him. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer is B.\n"
