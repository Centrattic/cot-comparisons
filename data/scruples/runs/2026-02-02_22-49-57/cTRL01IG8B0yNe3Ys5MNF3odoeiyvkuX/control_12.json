We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who donates money to homeless people, but there's a conflict when the wife gives away $200, which the husband feels is too much given their financial situation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the financial details. They make $60k a year together, and the husband will make $100k alone next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, with a couple of hundred left for food and essentials. So their monthly budget is tight. The husband gives around $125 a month, which the wife initially admired and started donating as well. But when she gives $200 in a week, the husband gets upset because that's a significant chunk of their remaining money after paying rent and utilities.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility vs. charitable giving. The wife's action of giving all the money in her wallet to homeless people might be seen as generous, but the husband is concerned about their ability to manage expenses. The question is whether the husband overreacted or is justified in being upset.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's worried about their financial stability. $200 is a large amount for them, and with only $100 left until mid-April, the wife's donation could lead to a cash flow problem. He argues that they need to be careful with their money, especially since they have other obligations like student loans.\n\nThe wife's perspective: She admired his generosity and was doing the same. She might see her actions as helping those in need, especially if she encountered many homeless people. She might not realize how much the $200 affects their budget, or she might feel that it's better to give it to those in need than to keep it.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The husband's anger is based on financial concerns. Is it reasonable to be upset about a large unplanned expense that could affect their budget? On the other hand, the wife might feel that the husband is being selfish or not supporting her charitable efforts. \n\nFinancial disagreements are common in relationships. The issue here is about communication and planning. If the wife gave away the money without discussing it, that could be problematic. However, if she believed she was acting in line with their shared values of generosity, she might not see the issue. The husband's reaction is about the financial impact, which is valid given their circumstances. \n\nThe husband might not be in the wrong because the donation was impulsive and not discussed, affecting their budget. However, the wife's intention was good, so maybe the husband overreacted. But considering their financial situation, the husband's concern is justified. The answer depends on whether the wife should have discussed the donation beforehand and if the husband's reaction is proportionate.\n\nIn the end, the husband's main point is about the financial strain. Since they have a tight budget, giving away $200 without prior discussion could be seen as irresponsible from his perspective. Therefore, the author (husband) is not in the wrong because he's justified in being concerned about their financial stability.\n"
