We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The couple's finances are tight, making $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. They have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. After paying rent and bills, they have about a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. The husband gives around $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in a week.\n\nSo, the main points are their financial situation and the disagreement over the amount given. The wife admires the husband's giving but then gives more than he does. The husband is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money. They have $100 left until April 15th after that.\n\nI need to consider if the husband is wrong for being angry. On one hand, giving to those in need is good, but they can't afford it. On the other hand, maybe the wife didn't consider the financial impact. The husband has been giving consistently, so maybe the wife's sudden large amount was unexpected. Also, communication might be an issue\u2014they didn't discuss their giving habits beforehand. But the husband's reaction was anger and arguing, which might not be the best approach. However, considering their financial constraints, it's reasonable for him to be upset. The wife giving all her wallet's money without discussing could be seen as not considering their shared finances. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's nuance. The husband's anger is valid given their situation, even if the wife's intentions were good. The key is the financial impact versus the altruistic act. Since they can't afford it, his reaction is understandable, so he's not the asshole.\n"
