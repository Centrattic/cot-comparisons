We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, next year he'll make $100k alone. They have rent and bills, and at the end of the month they only have a couple hundred left for food and other things.\n\nSo, the wife gave $200, which is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. The husband is upset because they can barely afford their expenses. The wife seems surprised he's mad, but the husband feels it was wasteful. \n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. On one hand, giving to homeless people is a charitable act. The husband himself gives money, so the wife is following his example. But the problem is the amount. If they're living on a tight budget, $200 is a lot. Maybe they should have discussed their budgeting for charitable giving.\n\nThe husband's reaction might be seen as being upset about money management rather than the act of giving itself. The wife might have thought she was helping, but without coordination with the husband. It's possible they didn't have a mutual agreement on how much to allocate for such things. \n\nIs the husband right to be angry? Well, if they have a tight budget, he's responsible for making sure they don't overspend. The wife giving away $200 without considering the financial implications could be seen as not being mindful of their shared finances. However, the husband could have been more open about setting limits on charitable giving earlier. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was following his example, but maybe she didn't realize the impact of giving that much. It's a communication issue. He was giving $125 a month, but she gave $200 in a week. The scale is different. \n\nSo, the question is whether the husband was wrong to be upset. The answer hinges on whether the wife's action was reckless given their financial situation. Since they're struggling to make ends meet, giving away a large portion of their disposable income could be imprudent. The husband is prioritizing their financial stability, which is important. The wife might not have considered the financial impact, so the husband isn't in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
