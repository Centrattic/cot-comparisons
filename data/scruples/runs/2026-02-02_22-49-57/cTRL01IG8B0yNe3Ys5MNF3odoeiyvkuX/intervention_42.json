We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, leaving only a couple hundred for food and necessities each month.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he feels is reasonable. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week, which the husband sees as irresponsible given their financial situation. They argue, and now the wife is ignoring him and he slept on the couch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband's reaction is justified. The key points are their financial constraints and whether $200 is a significant amount. Since they have a tight budget, $200 could impact their ability to cover essentials. The wife's action might have been well-intentioned, but the husband's concern about their financial stability is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was inspired by her husband's own charitable acts. She might have felt it was important to contribute, not realizing the financial impact. The husband might have communicated his financial limits better earlier, so she knew the boundaries. However, the sudden large donation without prior discussion could be seen as a breach of their mutual financial planning.\n\nIt's a balance between personal values and financial responsibility. The husband isn't wrong to be upset about the financial strain, but maybe he could have approached the situation with more understanding, considering the wife's intentions. Conversely, the wife should have discussed such a large expenditure with him first. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? I think not. His reaction stems from concern for their financial situation. However, the wife's lack of communication might be an issue. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
