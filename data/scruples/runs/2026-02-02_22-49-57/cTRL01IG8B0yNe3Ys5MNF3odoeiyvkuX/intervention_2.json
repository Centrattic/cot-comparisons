We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being angry that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k alone next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, and they both have student loans. So their monthly budget is tight, only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending money.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which he can afford since he's saying it's when he has change left or buys them food. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in one go, which is a significant portion of their monthly budget. The key point here is communication and financial management in their relationship. The wife might feel she's helping more, but the husband is upset because they can't afford such a large one-time expense. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The wife's intention to help is noble, but giving away all the money in her wallet without consulting her partner could be seen as irresponsible, especially in a tight budget. The husband's reaction is about their shared financial situation. Even though helping the homeless is a good cause, the wife should have discussed it with him to ensure they're on the same page. \n\nThe husband wasn't mad about the act of giving itself, but the amount and the fact that it wasn't discussed. So, the main issue is about financial decisions being made without mutual agreement. The wife might have thought it was praiseworthy, but the husband sees it as a problem. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the wife's action led to conflict because she didn't consider their budget or communicate her intentions. The husband's anger is a reaction to the sudden financial strain. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because the issue is about financial planning and communication rather than the act of donating.\n"
