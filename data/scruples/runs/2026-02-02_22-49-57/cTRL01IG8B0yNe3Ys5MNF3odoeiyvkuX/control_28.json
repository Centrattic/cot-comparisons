We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. \n\nThe author and his wife are both giving money to homeless people, which they can't really afford because they're making around $60k a year together. The author gives about $125 a month, but the wife gave $200 in a week. The author got mad because $200 is a significant portion of their budget, especially since they have rent and other bills. The wife thought it was okay, and they had an argument, leading to her locking him out. \n\nFirst, I should consider their financial situation. They have a combined income of $60k, pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. So that's $1700 a month, which is almost half their income if they're making around $5000 a month. After that, they have about $300 left for everything else. The $200 the wife gave away would leave them with only $100 until the next paycheck, which is tight. \n\nThe author's point is that giving $200 when they can barely afford it is irresponsible. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that helping others is important and that they have a moral obligation. But they also have their own needs and responsibilities. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, it's their money, and they have to manage their budget. The wife giving away money without discussing it could be seen as not considering their financial situation. However, maybe the wife felt that the author was fine with giving money since he does it too. But the author's reaction is based on the financial impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might have thought that helping others is important, but she didn't check with her partner first. The communication issue here is significant. If they had talked about their priorities, maybe they could have agreed on a way to help without causing financial strain. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable given their financial constraints. But maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's action of giving away $200 without considering their budget is the problem. The author is justified in being upset because it affects their ability to cover basic needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The wife's action was impulsive and financially irresponsible, and the author has valid concerns about their shared money. He's not the asshole for being mad about it.\n"
