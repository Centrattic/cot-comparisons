We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people when their finances are tight. The couple makes $60k a year, with the husband to make $100k next year. They have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and leftover money for food and necessities.\n\nThe wife gave $200 in one go, which the author feels is a significant chunk of their available funds. The key points here are their financial situation and communication. \n\nFirst, the author gives around $125 a month, which is about $1500 a year. The wife gave $200 in a week. That's a big difference in a short time. The user might think the author is right because they can't afford that, but others might say it's about personal choice in giving.\n\nBut financially, $200 is a large portion of their monthly discretionary spending. If they have only a couple hundred left after bills, giving $200 could cause issues. The author might feel it's irresponsible, especially since they have bills and savings goals. \n\nHowever, the wife was inspired by the author's actions, so she might not realize the financial impact. The problem here is communication. The author didn't set clear boundaries about how much they can give together. The wife didn't check with him before spending that amount, which led to conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they hadn't discussed their giving limits, maybe both share some responsibility. But the author's reaction is about their shared financial constraints. The wife's action, while generous, might not consider their financial planning. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the financial situation is tight, and sudden large expenses can cause stress. The wife should have discussed it with him. But maybe the author could have been more communicative about their budget. However, the immediate question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Given the context, the answer leans towards B (No).\n"
