We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a combined income of $60k, with the man set to make $100k next year. They have a budget that's tight, with only a couple hundred left after rent and bills. The wife gave away $200, and the husband is upset because it's a significant portion of their available funds each month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that they can't afford such a large donation right now, especially with their financial constraints. He's trying to manage their budget carefully, which is understandable given their income and expenses. The wife, on the other hand, admired his previous donations and was doing her own, but giving the entire $200 from her wallet seems like a big decision without discussing it with him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and financial responsibility. The wife gave away a substantial amount without consulting her partner, which is part of their shared finances. Even if her intention was good, using shared money without discussion can lead to conflict. The husband's reaction, while perhaps strong, is based on the reality of their financial situation. He's concerned about covering their basic needs, which is valid.\n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or personal context that might affect this. The wife might see this as an act of kindness and not realize the financial impact. However, in a partnership, major financial decisions should typically be discussed. The husband's frustration isn't just about the money but about the lack of communication.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Probably not. He's justified in being upset because the donation came from their shared resources without prior agreement. The wife should have discussed it with him first, especially considering their budget. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
