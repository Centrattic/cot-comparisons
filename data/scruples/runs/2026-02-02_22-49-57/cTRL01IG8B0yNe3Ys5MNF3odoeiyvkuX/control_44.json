We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They live in Chicago, make around $60k together, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are rent $1200, bills $500, and they have student loans. At the end of the month, they have a few hundred left for food and other expenses.\n\nThe wife gave $200 to homeless people, which the husband found excessive because they can't afford it. He gave about $125 a month. The wife was proud of her actions, but the husband was upset and they had an argument. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to be mad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband is concerned about their financial stability. They have a limited budget, and $200 is a significant chunk. The wife might see her actions as generous and necessary, helping those in need. But the husband's reaction is based on their financial constraints. \n\nIs the husband wrong for being upset? Well, financial disagreements are common in relationships. If they have a budget and the wife didn't discuss the $200 giving with him, that could be an issue. However, if the husband didn't set boundaries or communicate his concerns earlier, maybe he shares some responsibility.\n\nBut given the context, the wife gave a large portion of their available funds without considering their budget. The husband's anger is about their financial planning, not the act of giving itself. He's not against giving, but the amount. The wife might not have realized the impact on their finances. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If they had a mutual understanding about how much to give, then yes, but if the wife went over without discussing, then the husband's reaction is valid. The key is whether there was prior agreement. The story doesn't mention if they discussed giving limits. The husband gives $125, wife gives $200\u2014maybe he thought they had a mutual approach, but she exceeded it. \n\nIn relationships, finances are shared, so unplanned large expenses can cause issues. The wife might need to communicate better, but the husband could have set clearer boundaries. The question is whether being upset is wrong. Since the wife's action strained their finances without discussion, the husband isn't wrong to be upset. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
