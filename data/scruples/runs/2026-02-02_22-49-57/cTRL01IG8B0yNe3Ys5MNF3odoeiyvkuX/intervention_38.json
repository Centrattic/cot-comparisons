We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, I need to look at their financial situation. They make $60k combined, with rent and bills at $1700. They're both in student loans, and after those, they have a couple hundred left for other expenses. The husband gives about $125 a month, which he can afford. The wife gave $200 all at once, which the husband feels is too much because they can't really spare that much.\n\nThe key here is whether giving away $200 is responsible given their budget. The husband feels it's a significant portion of their remaining money, especially since they have only $100 left until the next paycheck. The wife, on the other hand, seems proud of giving more than him, which might be a point of contention.\n\nThe husband's reaction is anger and frustration, which makes sense if they're struggling to make ends meet. The wife's action could be seen as selfless, but if it's impacting their financial stability, maybe it's not the best time. However, the wife might feel that the husband is being too tightfisted or not empathetic enough.\n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because they need to manage their money carefully. But maybe he could have handled it better, like discussing it calmly instead of being abrupt. The wife also should have considered their budget before giving that much. But the main question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's reacting to a financial strain, I'd say the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
