We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being mad that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The couple makes $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. The wife gave away $200, which is a significant chunk of their remaining money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial situation. They're already tight on money, so $200 is a big hit. The husband gives around $125 a month, which he plans carefully. The wife gave all her cash on hand without discussing it, which caused tension.\n\nThe husband's reaction is frustration because the $200 affects their budget. The wife, on the other hand, was praised for his giving, so she might feel she's doing the same. But the key issue is communication and financial planning. The wife didn't check with him before spending that amount, which is a problem in shared finances.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong for being upset. The wife's action was impulsive and without discussion, which can be seen as irresponsible. The husband is concerned about their financial stability, which is valid. However, the wife's motivation is compassionate, but in a way that wasn't discussed. \n\nSo, the husband isn't the asshole for being angry about this. It's about shared responsibility in managing money. The wife should have communicated. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
