We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, their financial situation: they make about $60k together, and next year the husband will make $100k alone. They pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money, especially since it's before April 15th, which might be when their next paycheck comes.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he can afford because he's giving when he has extra, like loose singles or change. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week by giving every homeless person she saw money from her wallet. The husband is upset because this amount is not something they can easily afford, and it's causing a strain on their budget. \n\nHe wasn't expecting her to spend that much, especially since she was praising him for giving $20. The wife might feel that helping is important, but the husband's reaction is about the financial reality they're in. The key here is whether giving away $200 was a responsible decision given their financial constraints. \n\nThe wife might not have considered the budgetary impact, while the husband is trying to manage their finances. The question is about whether his anger is justified. Since they can't afford to lose $200 easily, and the wife didn't communicate her plans, the husband's reaction seems valid. However, the wife's intentions are good, but maybe she didn't realize the financial impact. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of both. The husband has a right to be concerned about their finances, and the wife might need to be more mindful of their budget. But the husband's response was to yell and argue, which could be seen as harsh. However, given the financial situation, his concern is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The wife's action was impulsive without considering their budget, and the husband's reaction, while maybe a bit strong, is based on valid financial concerns. The key is communication. The wife should have discussed the spending before doing it, and the husband should have expressed his concerns calmly. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
