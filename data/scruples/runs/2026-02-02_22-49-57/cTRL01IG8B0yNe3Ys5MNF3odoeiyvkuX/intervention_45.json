We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They live in Chicago, make $60k together (with the author set to make $100k next year), and have significant expenses like rent and student loans. The wife gave away $200, which they consider a lot because they're tight on money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is doing something the husband admires\u2014helping the homeless. She's even been inspired by his actions. But when she gave $200, it caused a conflict. The husband is upset because the money is a significant portion of their budget. The wife might feel that helping others is important, even if it affects their finances.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. They mentioned that they have a limited budget each month after rent, bills, and student loans. Giving away $200 might not be sustainable if it's coming out of their already small discretionary funds. The husband might feel that such a decision should be discussed together, especially when it's a large chunk of their money. On the other hand, the wife might see it as a compassionate act and not realize how impactful it is on their finances.\n\nThe husband's reaction is frustration and anger, which is understandable given their financial constraints. However, he could have approached the situation with more empathy, acknowledging her good intentions before focusing on the financial impact. The wife might also need to realize that while her actions are kind, they should consider their shared financial goals and communicate about such decisions.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance individual actions with the couple's financial planning. Both parties have valid points. The husband isn't in the wrong for being upset about the financial strain, but he could have handled the confrontation better. The wife, while acting on good intentions, might need to be more mindful of their budget and discuss such decisions with her partner first. So, considering the financial context and the need for communication, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset, but both could learn to approach these issues with more understanding.\n"
