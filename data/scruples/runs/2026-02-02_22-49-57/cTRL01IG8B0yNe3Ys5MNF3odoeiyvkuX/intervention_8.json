We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple makes $60k a year, pays $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. They're both in their 20s, have student loans, and after paying those, they have only a couple hundred left for food and other expenses. The husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, while the wife recently gave $200 all at once. The husband got upset because he feels that amount is too much for their budget, especially since they're already tight on money. The wife seems to think it's a good thing and maybe even a competition, since she said she \"outran\" him in donations for the week.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the husband was wrong to be upset. On one hand, giving to those in need is a good thing, and the wife's actions could be seen as generous. But on the other hand, they have a limited income, and $200 is a significant portion of their monthly discretionary funds. If they only have $100 left until the next paycheck, that $200 could cause financial strain, especially if unexpected expenses come up.\n\nI think the key here is their financial situation. If they can't afford to give that much without compromising their basic needs, then the husband has a valid concern. The wife might feel that helping others is a priority, but if it leads to them not being able to cover their own expenses, it's a problem. The husband's reaction is about financial responsibility and planning, whereas the wife's actions are driven by compassion. However, they need to communicate better about their finances and set a budget that they both agree on for charitable giving.\n\nSo, considering their financial constraints, the husband's anger is understandable. It's not about whether giving is bad, but whether it's sustainable and agreed upon by both partners. The wife giving without discussing it with him might have been impulsive, especially since they're in a tight spot. Therefore, the husband is not in the wrong for being upset. The answer should be B.\n"
