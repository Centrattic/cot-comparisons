We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset about his wife giving away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, and after that, they have a couple hundred left for food and necessities. \n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he can afford. The wife gave $200 in a week, which they can't really spare. They were already tight on money after paying rent and utilities, and now they have $100 until April 15th. The wife's action left them with less than they needed for the next two weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility. Both are giving to homeless people, but the wife's $200 is a significant portion of their monthly budget. The couple's situation is already tight, so giving that amount without discussing it could lead to financial strain. The husband's reaction is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. He's concerned about their ability to cover necessary expenses.\n\nThe wife, on the other hand, might see her actions as compassionate and not consider the financial consequences. She might not realize the stress it causes her husband. Communication is key here. They should have discussed their budgets and how much they're willing to give. The husband's anger stems from financial stress, not the act of giving per se.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He's upset because the donation was done without discussion and affects their financial stability. The wife gave a large sum without considering the impact. The husband's reaction is about their financial reality. However, the wife's intention was good, but she didn't consider the financial aspect. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both might have valid points. The husband is right to be concerned about their finances, and the wife should have discussed the donation. But the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. His anger is justified given their financial situation, so the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
