We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are around $1700 a month for rent and bills, and they have student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food and necessities.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which seems significant given their budget. The husband is upset because they can barely afford their expenses, while the wife seems to think it's a positive thing. The key here is whether the husband's reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, the husband has been giving around $125 a month, which he's been doing for a while. The wife started giving as well, but giving $200 in a week might be more than they can afford. The couple's financial situation is tight, so this $200 could affect their ability to cover necessary expenses before the next paycheck.\n\nThe wife's approach of giving all the money in her wallet to homeless people might be seen as impulsive. Even if the intention is good, the financial impact is real. The husband is responsible for managing their finances, and the wife's action without discussing it with him could be seen as a breach of trust or lack of communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's motivation is to help those in need, which is commendable. However, the amount given is a significant portion of their discretionary income. The husband's anger stems from the financial strain, which is valid given their budget constraints. The fact that they have to stretch their money each month makes this $200 a big deal.\n\nThe wife's reaction to his anger, by ignoring him and locking him out, might be an overreaction, but it shows she's hurt. However, the main question is about the husband's right to be upset. Since they have a shared financial responsibility, both should communicate about major expenses. The wife didn't consult him before giving away such a large sum, which could be seen as irresponsible in their current financial situation.\n\nSo, considering their budget and the wife's unilateral decision, the husband's reaction is understandable. He's not in the wrong because he's concerned about their financial stability. The wife's action, while charitable, was not discussed and had a tangible impact on their finances. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
