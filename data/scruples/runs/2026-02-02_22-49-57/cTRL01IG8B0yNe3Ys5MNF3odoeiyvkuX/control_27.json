We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the wife giving away $200 to homeless people, and the husband is upset about it. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in bills, leaving only a couple hundred for food and other needs.\n\nFirst, the husband gives around $125 a month, which he considers manageable. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in one go. The key issue here is whether giving away $200 is reasonable given their financial situation. \n\nThe husband points out that after paying rent and utilities, they only have $100 left until April 15th. That $200 donation is a significant chunk of their remaining budget, which could affect their ability to cover essentials. The wife's action might have been impulsive, especially if they were already tight on money. \n\nThe wife, however, is inspired by her husband's previous donations and might feel that helping is important. But the difference here is the amount. The husband's $125 monthly is spread out, but the wife's $200 in one week is a larger one-time expense. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a common concern in relationships. While charity is good, it's also about managing shared funds. The wife didn't consult the husband about such a large sum, which could be seen as disrespectful to their financial planning. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's intention was to help, and the husband might have been too harsh in his reaction, considering she was following his example. But the financial impact is real. The husband's anger stems from the practicality of their budget, not just the donation itself. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It seems like the wife made a decision that affected their shared finances without discussing it. The husband has a right to be concerned about their financial stability. However, his reaction was frustration and anger, which might have been excessive. \n\nBut the main question is whether the husband is wrong for being upset. Given their financial constraints, the $200 donation by the wife without prior discussion is a valid point of contention. So, the husband isn't in the wrong for being mad. The wife should have communicated better about such a significant expense. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
