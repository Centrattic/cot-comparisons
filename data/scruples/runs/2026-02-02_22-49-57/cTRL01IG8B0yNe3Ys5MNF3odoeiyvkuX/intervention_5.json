We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation. They make $60k a year, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and after that, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. The wife gave away all the money in her wallet, which totaled $200, without consulting her husband. The author feels this was irresponsible given their tight finances.\n\nPersonal values come into play here. Both have been giving to homeless people, which they see as important. The wife admires the husband's generosity and started doing it herself. However, when she gave away $200, it was more than the husband's usual $125/month, and he reacted strongly. \n\nCommunication is a key point. The wife didn't discuss the $200 with her husband, and he felt blindsided. The husband's reaction might be seen as valid because they're managing a budget together, and unexpected large expenses can cause stress. On the other hand, the wife's intent was to help people in need, which is also a valid perspective.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're in a committed relationship, managing finances together is expected. The wife giving away a significant portion of their shared funds without discussion could be seen as not considering the couple's financial plan. However, the husband's reaction could come off as dismissive of her compassionate actions, especially if she felt the need to highlight her contributions.\n\nBalancing both sides: The wife should have discussed the $200 with her husband, but the husband's anger without understanding her motivations might not be fair. However, given the financial constraints, the husband's concern is legitimate. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the wife acted without consultation, the author might not be entirely at fault. But maybe he could have handled it better. Hmm. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Based on the analysis, the answer is B.\n"
