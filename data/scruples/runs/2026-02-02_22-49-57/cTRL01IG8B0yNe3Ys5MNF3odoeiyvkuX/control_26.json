We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband about to make $100k alone. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. They have a couple hundred left each month for food and other needs.\n\nThe key points here are their financial situation and their perspectives on charitable giving. The husband gives around $125 a month, which he considers reasonable. The wife gave $200 in a week, which the husband sees as excessive given their budget. The wife, on the other hand, admiring the husband's giving, might feel she is contributing similarly. \n\nFinancially, $200 is a significant portion of their monthly discretionary funds. If they only have around $200 left after rent, bills, and loans, giving away $200 would leave them with little to nothing until April 15th. This could lead to financial strain, especially in a city like Chicago with high costs. \n\nThe husband's reaction is based on concern for their financial stability. He might feel that the wife didn't consider their shared budget and the potential impact on their ability to cover essential expenses. The wife, however, might feel that her actions are compassionate and that the husband is being overly focused on money.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication about financial priorities is crucial. The wife giving away money without discussing it with her husband first could be seen as not considering their shared financial responsibilities. The husband's frustration is valid because their resources are limited. While altruism is commendable, it's important to balance it with financial planning, especially when it affects the household's stability.\n\nHowever, there's also a counterpoint. The husband initially praised her for smaller acts, so she might not have realized the significance of $200. The issue here is communication and mutual understanding of their financial boundaries. The husband's anger might have been expressed harshly, leading to a conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on the context. He's right to be concerned about their finances, but his reaction could have been more constructive. The wife should have discussed her intentions to give a larger amount. Since the question is about whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards 'No' because his concern for their financial stability is valid, even if his reaction was harsh. The wife's action, without prior discussion, contributes to the conflict. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
