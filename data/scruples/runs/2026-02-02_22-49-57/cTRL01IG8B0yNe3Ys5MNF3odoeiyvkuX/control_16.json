We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The couple's combined income is around $60k, and the husband will be making $100k soon. They have expenses like rent at $1200 and other bills at $500. After all that, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other necessities each month.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which the husband feels is too much since their budget is tight. The question is whether he's the asshole for being mad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's argument is that they can't afford to give that much, especially since they're already in a tight budget. The wife's perspective is that she's helping people in need, which the husband has always supported. She might feel that it's a valid use of their resources, even if it's a significant amount. \n\nThe husband initially gives about $125 a month, and the wife giving $200 in a week is more than that, which could be seen as a sudden increase. The key points here are communication and financial planning. If the wife gave away $200 without discussing it with her husband, especially when their budget is tight, that could be a problem. Financial decisions in a relationship usually require mutual agreement, especially when it's a large portion of their monthly funds.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might believe in charity and helping others, which is commendable, but she might not realize the financial strain it could cause. The husband's reaction could be seen as valid because they need to manage their money responsibly, especially with upcoming expenses and student loans. However, his response of yelling and the argument might have been harsh, and maybe a better approach would have been to discuss it calmly.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action did affect their shared finances without prior discussion. The husband has a right to be concerned about their financial stability. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but the way he reacted could be improved. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for being mad, not the reaction. \n\nIn this case, the answer is likely B (No), because the husband's concern about their financial situation is valid. The wife should have discussed the donation with him, as it's a significant part of their budget. So the husband isn't wrong for being upset.\n"
