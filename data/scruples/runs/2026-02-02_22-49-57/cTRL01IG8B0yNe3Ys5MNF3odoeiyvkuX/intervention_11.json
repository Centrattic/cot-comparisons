We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent, $500 in bills, and student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred for food and other needs.\n\nSo, the key points here are their financial situation and the wife's action of giving away $200. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial constraints. If they're already tight on money, $200 is a significant chunk, especially if it's from their discretionary funds. The wife might see helping the homeless as important, but the husband might feel it's irresponsible given their budget. \n\nBut then, is the husband in the wrong for being upset? Altruism is generally praised, but when it affects their financial stability, there's room for disagreement. The wife gave all the money in her wallet, which suggests it wasn't planned. The husband might feel she didn't consider their shared financial responsibilities. \n\nThe wife's reaction of being surprised at his anger could indicate a disconnect in priorities. The husband might feel her action was impulsive and not discussed. On the other hand, the wife might believe that helping those in need is a moral imperative regardless of the financial impact.\n\nSince both have valid perspectives, the question is whether the husband's reaction is justified. Given their financial situation, it's reasonable for him to be concerned about unexpected expenses affecting their budget. However, the wife's intention to help is also commendable. \n\nBut the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. The problem here isn't necessarily about right or wrong, but differing values and communication. The husband's anger comes from financial stress, not a lack of compassion. The wife might have needed to discuss her intentions with him beforehand. So, the answer would be the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
