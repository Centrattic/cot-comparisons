We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is at fault for being upset that their wife gave away $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple makes about $60k a year together, with the husband expecting to make $100k alone next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loan payments. They have a couple hundred left each month for food, necessities, and spending. The husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which the wife admires and has started doing too. However, the wife gave away $200 in one week, which the husband found excessive and led to an argument.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Financial Context**: The couple's budget is tight. After rent and bills, they have limited funds. The $200 from the wife would significantly impact their remaining money until the next paycheck. The husband's reaction is based on financial strain.\n\n2. **Prior Agreement or Communication**: The story mentions that they both give to homeless people, but the wife gave a large amount without prior discussion. The husband had set a limit of around $125/month, which the wife exceeded. It's unclear if they had a mutual agreement about their charitable contributions.\n\n3. **Intentions and Perceptions**: The wife might have felt she was contributing positively, matching or exceeding her husband's efforts. The husband felt it was irresponsible given their budget. Both might have valid perspectives based on their values and financial priorities.\n\n4. **Conflict Resolution**: The wife kept bringing up her actions, leading to the argument. The husband's frustration was about the financial impact, while the wife was surprised at his reaction, indicating a possible communication gap.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The husband's concern is about financial responsibility given their circumstances. The wife's action stems from a desire to help, which is commendable, but without discussing it with her partner first, it could be seen as inconsiderate of their shared finances. However, the husband's reaction might come off as dismissive of her motivations. \n\nIn many relationships, financial decisions, especially significant ones, are considered jointly. The wife didn't consult with her husband before giving away a substantial amount. That lack of communication could be a point against her. On the other hand, the husband might have been more proactive in discussing their budget and setting mutual guidelines for charitable giving. \n\nGiven that the couple is in a tight financial situation and the wife's action impacted their shared funds, the husband's reaction is understandable. However, the way he expressed his frustration (calling her actions \"senseless\") might have been hurtful. The wife also could have discussed her intentions before giving away the money. \n\nOverall, both have valid points, but the wife's action without prior discussion and the husband's financial concern make it a complex situation. However, since the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong, the answer would hinge on whether his reaction was justified. Since the $200 significantly affects their budget and he had no prior knowledge of her plan, he's not in the wrong. The wife's action was inconsiderate, but the husband's anger is a reaction to a valid financial issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
