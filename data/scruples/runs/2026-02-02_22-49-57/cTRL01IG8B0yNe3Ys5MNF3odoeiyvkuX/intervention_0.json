We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. They have student loans and only a couple hundred left for food and expenses each month. The author gives about $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial situation. They're making $60k together, but after rent, bills, and loans, they have very little left. $200 from the wife's wallet would significantly impact their budget. The author is concerned about their financial stability, especially since they have upcoming expenses until April 15th. The wife's action seems impulsive and without considering the family's budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife was inspired by the husband's charitable acts and tried to do the same. However, giving away all her money at once isn't sustainable. The key issue here is financial planning and communication. Neither party might have discussed their spending habits or charitable contributions in advance. The husband might have expected some communication before such a large expenditure, and the wife might have thought she was acting in line with their shared values.\n\nBut since their money is likely shared (as they live together and pay bills jointly), using a large portion without discussing could be seen as irresponsible. The husband's reaction is about financial prudence, while the wife's action is about compassion. However, balancing these two is crucial. The husband isn't wrong for being upset because the $200 affects their overall budget. The wife might have overstepped without considering their financial constraints. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
