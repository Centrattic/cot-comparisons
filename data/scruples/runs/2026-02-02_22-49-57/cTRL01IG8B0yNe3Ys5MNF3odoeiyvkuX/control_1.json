We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting upset when his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year together, rent is $1,200, other bills $500, student loans. After paying those, they have a couple hundred left for food and other needs. The husband gives around $125 a month. The wife gave $200 in a week. The husband got mad, and they had a fight. Now, the question is whether he's the asshole for being upset.\n\nHmm. Well, from a financial standpoint, $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. They only have a couple hundred left after rent and bills, so this $200 could affect their ability to cover essentials. The husband mentions they have $100 until April 15th after this expense. That's tight. The wife might feel it's important to help, but if it's causing financial strain, maybe it's a point of contention.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see her actions as compassionate. The husband admires her for following his example, but this time it's a larger amount. He's upset because it's a big portion of their discretionary income. However, should he have communicated that before? Maybe they need to discuss their financial priorities. The wife giving away the money without considering the husband's perspective could be an issue. But the husband's reaction might be seen as dismissive of her compassion.\n\nAlso, the wife gave all the money in her wallet to homeless people. If she didn't have a set budget for charity, maybe she didn't realize the impact. But if they have a shared budget, she should be aware of the financial constraints. The husband's anger is about the financial impact, while the wife's intent was to help. Is the husband in the wrong for being upset, or is he justified in being concerned about their finances?\n\nI think it's a bit of both. The husband has a valid point about the financial strain, but maybe he could have approached it without being so harsh. However, the wife might have overstepped by giving such a large amount without discussing it. In relationships, communication is key. The husband's reaction might be justified because $200 is a big hit to their budget, but he could have handled it better. Alternatively, the wife should have communicated her intentions. But given the context, the husband isn't in the wrong because the financial aspect is a legitimate concern. So answer B.\n"
