We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The key points here are their financial situation and their differing approaches to giving.\n\nFirst, their finances: they make $60k together now, with the husband expecting $100k next year. Rent is $1200 and other bills $500. After that, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. The wife gave away all her cash on hand, which the husband hadn't anticipated, leading to financial strain before the next payday.\n\nThe wife admires the husband's giving but took it a step further. She gave all her money to homeless people, which the husband felt was irresponsible given their financial situation. He was upset because she didn't consider the impact on their shared budget. She, on the other hand, seems to have thought the act was positive and maybe expected his approval.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's managing their finances carefully, giving what he can afford. The wife's action was a one-time, large expenditure without his input, which he found reckless. The question is whether his anger is justified.\n\nConsidering that they're a couple, financial decisions should ideally be mutual. The wife didn't communicate her plan to give $200 beforehand, which could have led to a discussion about priorities. However, the husband's reaction might have been overly harsh, especially since he's the one who gives money to homeless people as well. His anger could stem from financial stress rather than the act itself. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might not have realized the financial impact. But given their budget, $200 is a substantial amount. The husband is right to be concerned about their shared resources. The wife's approach was impulsive, and the husband's reaction is about financial responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't wrong for feeling upset given their financial constraints. The wife isn't entirely in the right for not considering their budget. However, the husband's way of expressing his anger might have been too harsh, but the core issue is about financial management. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong because the financial situation is tight, and the wife's action disrupted their budget without prior discussion. However, communication could have been better from both sides. But based on the question, the answer is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since his reaction is based on their financial reality, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
