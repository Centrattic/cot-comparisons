We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife are giving money to homeless people, but there's a conflict when she gives away $200. \n\nFirst, their financial situation: they make a combined $60k a year, and the husband will make $100k next year. They pay $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills. After that, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So, they're living on a tight budget. \n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week. That's a significant chunk of their remaining money. The husband is upset because they can't afford to give that much, especially since they're already planning for rent and utilities. They only have $100 left until April 15th, which is a really short time to cover expenses. \n\nThe wife seems proud of herself for giving more than her husband, which might be part of the issue. The husband's reaction is anger, leading to an argument and her locking him out. \n\nNow, should he be mad? Well, giving to the homeless is good, but when you're on a tight budget, it's a financial decision. Both should ideally discuss their finances and agree on how much to give. The wife gave $200 without considering the impact on their budget, which the husband is upset about. \n\nBut maybe the husband's reaction was a bit harsh. He could have talked to her instead of getting angry. However, the wife gave a large sum without communication, which could be seen as irresponsible given their financial situation. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the wife acted without considering their shared finances, and the husband was upset because of the financial strain. The husband isn't in the wrong for being upset, especially since they need to manage their money carefully. So the answer is B.\n"
