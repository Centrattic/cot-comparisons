We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being angry that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Their combined income is $60k a year, with him set to make $100k next year. They have significant expenses like rent ($1200) and bills ($500), and after paying student loans, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other needs.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in a week. The husband is upset because they're already tight on money and now have only $100 until mid-April. The wife seems surprised he's upset and is ignoring him now.\n\nSo, the key points are: their financial situation is strained. Giving $200 when they can't afford it might be irresponsible, even if the intention is good. The husband's reaction is about financial responsibility, while the wife's is about generosity. But in a situation where they're struggling to make ends meet, is giving away that much money reasonable?\n\nThe husband isn't against giving to homeless people (he does it too), but the wife's amount is causing financial strain. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset. Financial planning is important in a relationship, so maybe he's right to be concerned. However, the wife might feel her generosity is important. But given their financial constraints, $200 is a significant chunk. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong), because while generosity is good, they need to manage their finances together, and her action caused financial stress. The husband is right to be concerned about their budget.\n"
