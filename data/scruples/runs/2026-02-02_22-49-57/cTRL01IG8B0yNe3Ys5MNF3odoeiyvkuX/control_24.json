We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, and he's set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, with not much left for food and other needs each month.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author gives about $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in a week. The key point here is the suddenness and amount of the wife's donation relative to their financial situation. They mention that $200 is a significant chunk, leaving them with $100 until the next payday. That seems like a lot for their budget.\n\nThe wife admired the husband's charitable actions and started doing it herself, but giving $200 in a week might be beyond what they can comfortably afford, especially since they're already tight on money. The husband's reaction is based on financial practicality, while the wife might see it as a moral choice. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. On one hand, the wife's actions are altruistic, and supporting others is commendable. On the other hand, they need to manage their finances responsibly. The wife didn't consult the husband about such a large expense, which might be seen as a breach of financial planning. \n\nHowever, the husband's response was anger and then sleeping on the couch, which escalated the situation. Maybe he should have expressed his concerns calmly instead of getting angry. But given their financial constraints, his frustration is understandable. The wife's action was impulsive and without considering the household's budget. \n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong because the wife's action was a significant financial decision without prior discussion. They should have communicated better about their charitable giving limits. The wife might have acted out of good intentions, but the amount was irresponsible given their finances. However, the husband's reaction could have been more constructive. \n\nBut the main issue is whether he's wrong for being upset. Since they're a couple, they should have a mutual understanding on such matters. The wife's action was a big financial hit to them, so his reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
