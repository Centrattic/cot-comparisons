We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation is tight. They make $60k combined, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. But right now, they have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. So, $200 is a significant chunk of their limited budget.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he can afford because he's careful with how much he gives\u2014like loose change or buying food when he can. The wife, on the other hand, gave away $200 in a week by giving all the money in her wallet to every homeless person she saw. The husband is upset because this $200 reduces their already tight budget to only $100 until the next paycheck. \n\nThe wife seems to think that helping homeless people is more important than their financial stability, especially since she admired the husband's previous contributions. But the issue here is that her action was impulsive and didn't consider their financial constraints. The husband feels she acted recklessly, and the wife is upset that he's mad. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is wrong for being upset. From a financial responsibility standpoint, the husband has a right to be concerned because their budget is already tight. The wife's action could lead to financial strain, which affects both of them. However, the wife's intention was to help others, which is noble, but she didn't consider the couple's financial planning. \n\nIn relationships, communication about spending, especially on charitable giving, is important. The wife might not have realized the impact of her $200 donation. The husband's reaction is about the financial reality, while the wife's is about the charitable intent. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If the wife had discussed her plan to give money, maybe they could have found a middle ground. But since she acted without considering their budget, the husband's anger is understandable. His response might be seen as necessary to address the financial situation. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
