We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife gave away $200 to homeless people, and the husband is upset because they can't afford it. He says they make $60k collectively, he'll be making $100k next year, but right now they have to budget tightly. Their rent is $1200, other bills $500, and they're paying student loans, so their monthly expenses are pretty high. They only have a couple hundred left for food and necessities each month.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, usually when he has loose change or small bills. The wife started doing this too, giving her lunch or $10. But this time, she gave all the money in her wallet, $200, which left them with only $100 until the 15th. He's upset because he thinks it was senseless, and she's been ignoring him and locked him out of the bedroom. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is trying to be generous, which is a good thing, but the husband is concerned about their financial situation. The key here is communication and mutual agreement on financial matters. The wife gave a significant amount without discussing it with the husband, which could be seen as not respecting his input or the shared budget. Even though the husband gives money to homeless people, he's doing it in a way that he can afford, while the wife's action left them with very little. \n\nThe author (husband) is not wrong for being upset. Financial decisions in a relationship should be mutual, especially when it involves a large sum that affects their shared resources. The wife's action, while well-intentioned, was made without considering their budget and the husband's perspective. The husband's reaction is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself, which is valid. \n\nHowever, the husband's response might have been harsh. He could have approached the situation more calmly, expressing his concerns without yelling. The wife also might feel her generosity was criticized, which could hurt her. But the main issue is the lack of communication. The husband is not in the wrong for being upset, but both could have handled it better. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
