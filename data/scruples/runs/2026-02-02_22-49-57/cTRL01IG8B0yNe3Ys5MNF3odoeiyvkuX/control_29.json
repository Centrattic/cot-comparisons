We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k alone next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loan payments. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their financial situation. If they're on a tight budget, giving $200 might be a significant portion of their discretionary funds. The husband gives around $125 a month, which the wife admired, but then she goes ahead and gives $200 in a week. The key here is the amount relative to their income. $200 from someone who makes $60k a year is a noticeable chunk, especially if they're already struggling with expenses. \n\nNext, communication seems to be an issue. The wife was talking about her giving constantly, and when the husband mentioned his $125, she compared it and gave $200 in a week. The husband was surprised and upset, thinking it's too much when they can barely afford it. The wife's reaction was to lock him out of the bedroom, which is a sign of a deeper problem in how they handle disagreements.\n\nEthically, giving to the homeless is commendable, but it's also a personal choice that should consider mutual agreement in a relationship. The wife made a unilateral decision without discussing it with her husband, especially when their finances are already tight. The husband has a right to be concerned about their collective financial health. \n\nHowever, the husband's reaction might have been harsh. Yelling \"what the fuck?\" and calling the action senseless could have been hurtful, even if he's frustrated. The wife might feel her compassionate act was disrespected. \n\nStill, the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's action of giving all her money without consultation, while understandable in intent, might be impractical given their finances. The husband's anger is about financial responsibility, not the act of giving itself. So he's not the asshole for being upset about the money, but maybe he handled it poorly. The wife's response (locking him out) is also problematic, but the question is about the author's perspective. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), as the husband isn't in the wrong for being concerned about their financial situation.\n"
