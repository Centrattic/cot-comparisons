We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k together, with the husband to make $100k next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in bills. After that, they have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses. So $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. \n\nThe wife gave all the money in her wallet to homeless people. The husband gives about $125 a month, so she gave double that in a week. He got upset because they can't afford that. The wife, on the other hand, seems proud of herself and was surprised by his reaction. The husband feels it's irresponsible given their finances, while she might see it as compassionate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Arguments for him not being in the wrong: they have limited funds, and giving $200 when they're already tight is a financial strain. He's trying to manage their budget, which is a shared responsibility. Also, the wife didn't consult him before giving away the money, which could be a point of contention in their communication.\n\nArguments for him being in the wrong: compassion and kindness are important. If they can afford some giving, even if small, maybe it's okay. The wife's action might reflect her values, and the husband's anger could be seen as being too focused on money over helping others.\n\nBut considering their financial constraints, $200 is a large amount. They have only $100 left until the next paycheck. The husband's job is to manage their finances, so his reaction is about responsibility. The wife's action might be impulsive without considering the couple's budget. So, it's a conflict between values and financial planning. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate about financial decisions. The wife gave away money without discussing it, which is a problem. The husband's anger is about the financial impact, which is valid. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
