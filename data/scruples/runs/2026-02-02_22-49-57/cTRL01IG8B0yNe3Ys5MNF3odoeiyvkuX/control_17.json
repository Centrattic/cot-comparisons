We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year, pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and after expenses, they have only a couple hundred left. The husband gives about $125 a month. The wife gave $200 all at once, which seems significant given their budget.\n\nThe husband is upset because $200 is a large portion of their remaining money, especially since they have $100 left until April 15th. The wife, on the other hand, thought the husband would be happy and didn't realize the financial strain it caused.\n\nNow, considering if the husband is in the wrong. The key points are: 1) Is it reasonable to be upset about the wife's donation given their financial constraints? 2) Was the wife's action irresponsible, or was it a personal choice?\n\nThe husband isn't against giving; he does it himself. The issue is the amount and the lack of communication. The wife gave all the money in her wallet without discussing it, which the husband found irresponsible. However, he also didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's reaction is about financial responsibility, which is valid when there are limited resources. On the other hand, the wife's action was generous and she didn't know it would cause such a problem. The fact that she was surprised by his anger suggests a communication gap. \n\nBut the husband did mention they only have $100 left until the 15th, which is a significant financial issue. So, his anger might be justified because $200 could impact their bills or emergencies. However, he didn't express his concerns beforehand, so he shares some responsibility for not setting expectations.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of both. But the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he was upset over a one-time expense that his wife considered okay, but given the tight budget, his reaction is understandable. However, the way he reacted (saying \"what the fuck\") might have been harsh. But the core issue is financial responsibility. The wife didn't consider the impact, but the husband could have discussed his concerns earlier. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because the wife's action was impulsive and affected their finances. The answer is B.\n"
