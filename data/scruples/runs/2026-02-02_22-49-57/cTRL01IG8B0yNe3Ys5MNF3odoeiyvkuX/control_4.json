We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's wife gave away $200 to homeless people, and he's upset about it because they can't really afford it. Their combined income is $60k a year, rent and bills take up $1700 a month, and they have student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred for food and other expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if giving away $200 is reasonable given their financial situation. The author gives around $125 a month, which he says is what he can afford. The wife gave $200 in a week, which is more than double his monthly contribution. The problem is that their budget is tight, so $200 is a significant chunk of their remaining money. The author is justified in being upset because this could affect their ability to cover essential expenses or save for emergencies.\n\nNext, communication is a factor. The wife didn't discuss this with him before giving away the money. Even though both support helping the homeless, they should have a mutual understanding about their spending, especially when it's a large portion of their budget. The wife might feel it's important to help, but she should consider the couple's financial limits. On the other hand, the author could have been more open about his concerns earlier instead of being surprised and reacting strongly.\n\nThe wife's approach might be seen as self-serving if she's trying to out-give the author, especially since she mentioned \"outran you this week.\" This could indicate a need for validation or competition, which might be why the author felt it was senseless. However, her intention to help others is commendable, but the amount is impractical for their budget.\n\nThe author's reaction is also important. He expressed his frustration, leading to an argument and her locking him out. That's a serious consequence. While he's not wrong about the financial aspect, his response might have been harsh. He could have addressed it more calmly to find a solution together instead of getting angry.\n\nIn conclusion, both have valid points. The author isn't wrong to be upset about the financial strain, but he could have handled the situation better. The wife should have consulted with him before spending such a large sum. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because his reaction is within reason given their financial constraints, even if his approach could be improved.\n"
