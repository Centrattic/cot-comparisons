We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, the context: They're a young couple with a combined income of $60k, living in Chicago, paying $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills. Their budget is tight, with only a couple hundred left for food and necessities. The author gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he can manage. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in one week, all the cash she had. The author is upset because that's a significant portion of their budget, and now they're left with $100 until the next paycheck. He feels she was careless with their money.\n\nNow, considering their financial situation, $200 is a big chunk. They have to cover rent, bills, student loans, and daily expenses. The wife giving away that much without discussing it with the author could be seen as not being considerate of their shared finances. The author is within his rights to be upset because it affects their ability to manage their expenses. However, the wife's intention was charitable, which is a positive act. The key issue here is communication and shared financial responsibility in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss major expenses, especially when they're shared. If both partners aren't on the same page about how to allocate their money, conflicts arise. The wife might have thought she was doing something good, but without consulting her partner, it could lead to financial strain. The author's anger is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. On the other hand, the wife might feel her actions are compassionate, but she didn't consider the couple's financial plan.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He has a right to be concerned about their budget. The real problem is that the wife gave away a significant amount without discussing it. The author's reaction is about financial responsibility, which is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
