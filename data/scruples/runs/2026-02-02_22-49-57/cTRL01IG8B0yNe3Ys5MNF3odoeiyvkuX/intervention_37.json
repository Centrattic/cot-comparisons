We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. They make $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 rent and $500 other bills, plus student loans. They only have a couple hundred left each month for food, necessities, and spending. That doesn't sound like a lot. The $200 his wife gave away is a significant chunk of their remaining money for the month, especially since they only have $100 left until April 15th after that.\n\nThe wife has been admiring the husband's donations and started doing similar things, like giving her lunch or $10. But giving all the money in her wallet, which turned out to be $200, seems like a lot. The husband gave about $125 a month, so she \"outran\" him in a week with $200. That's a lot more than he does, and the husband is upset because it's a big expense for them right now.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He acknowledges that homeless people need the money more than they do, but he also thinks the wife was being senseless. The question is if he's wrong for being mad. \n\nFrom a financial responsibility perspective, when you're on a tight budget, unexpected expenses can cause stress. If both partners have different spending habits or donation priorities, it can lead to conflict. The wife might see helping others as a moral duty, but the husband is concerned about their financial stability. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The wife didn't consider the financial impact of her donation, and the husband felt blindsided. The husband's reaction might seem harsh, but given the context of their financial situation, his anger is understandable. On the other hand, the wife's actions are compassionate, but maybe she should have discussed the donation with him first, especially given their budget constraints.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If being in the wrong means he's wrong for being upset about the financial impact, then maybe not. His reaction is based on their financial reality. However, if the wife should have consulted him before making such a large donation, then the husband's anger is justified. The key point is whether the husband is wrong for prioritizing financial responsibility over his wife's generosity. I think the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's reacting to a situation where their shared financial plan was compromised.\n"
