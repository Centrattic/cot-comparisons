We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's wife gave away $200 to homeless people, and he's upset because their budget is tight. They make $60k a year, paying $1200 rent and $500 in bills, with student loans. They have only a couple hundred left each month for food and other expenses. The author gives around $125 a month, but the wife gave $200 in a week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is helping people in need, which is a noble cause. But the husband is concerned about their financial situation. The key points here are their financial constraints and communication.\n\nThe husband says they can barely afford their expenses. Giving away $200 without discussing it with him might be seen as not considering their shared financial responsibilities. On the other hand, the wife might feel that helping is important and that the husband should be supportive. However, since they are a couple, major financial decisions should ideally be made together, especially when the amount is significant relative to their budget.\n\nThe wife giving away all the money in her wallet without prior agreement could be seen as impulsive. If they had a shared budget, she might have known the impact of her actions. The husband's reaction is about the financial strain, not the act of giving itself. The fact that he gives regularly shows he supports helping, but the amount his wife gave was more than he does, which might have been unexpected.\n\nCommunication is also an issue. The wife kept bringing up her giving, which might have annoyed the husband. Then, when she revealed the $200, he was upset because it's a large portion of their remaining money. The wife locking him out of the bedroom and ignoring him might indicate a lack of resolution in their argument, but the initial issue is about financial decisions.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's upset because they need the money and she didn't consult him, then he's not wrong. However, if he's dismissive of her desire to help without understanding, maybe there's a problem. But given the context, the main issue is the financial impact and lack of communication. The wife should have discussed the $200 giving, and the husband is justified in being upset about the financial strain. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
