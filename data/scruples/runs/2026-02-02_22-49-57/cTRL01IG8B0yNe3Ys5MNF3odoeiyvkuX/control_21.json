We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a combined income of $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are around $1700 a month for rent and bills, and they have student loans. They have a couple of hundred left for food and other expenses each month. The husband usually gives about $125 a month to homeless individuals, and the wife gave $200 in a week, which caused tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband's perspective is that they can't afford such a large expenditure, especially since they're already tight on money. The wife's perspective is that she's following his example and helping where she can. The question is whether the husband was wrong to be upset.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a key factor here. The $200 is a significant portion of their monthly budget. If they only have $100 left until the next paycheck, this could cause financial strain. The husband might be justified in feeling that the wife acted recklessly, especially since they have financial obligations like rent, utilities, and student loans.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see her actions as compassionate and in line with the husband's own charitable actions. The fact that she was surprised by his reaction suggests she didn't consider the financial impact, which could mean she's not at fault entirely. However, the husband has a right to be concerned about their financial stability. \n\nThe communication aspect is also important. The wife kept bringing up her donations, which might have been a way to seek validation. The husband's reaction was sudden and strong, leading to conflict. It's possible that both could have communicated better. But the core issue is whether the husband was wrong for being upset. Given the financial constraints, his reaction seems reasonable. He's trying to manage their finances responsibly, and the wife's actions might have been impulsive without considering the budget. \n\nHowever, some might argue that generosity is a personal choice and that the husband should support his wife's charitable actions. But when it comes to shared finances, both partners need to agree on how to allocate funds, especially when there's a tight budget. The wife giving away $200 without discussing it with the husband could be seen as overstepping, especially if it affects their financial planning. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key is that they need to discuss their financial priorities and set boundaries for charitable giving. The wife might need to be more mindful of the budget, and the husband could approach the conversation with understanding rather than anger. But in terms of being wrong for being upset, the answer would lean towards him not being the asshole.\n"
