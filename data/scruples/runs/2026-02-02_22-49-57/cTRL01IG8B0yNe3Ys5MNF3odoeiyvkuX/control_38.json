We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting angry that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple's finances: they make $60k a year now, and the husband will be making $100k next year. Their monthly expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills. They both have student loans. At the end of the month, they have a couple hundred left for food and necessities. So, $200 is a significant chunk of what they have after covering essential expenses.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he seems okay with. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a single week, which they can't afford right now because they only have $100 left until April 15th. The husband is upset because the wife gave away more than he does, and the wife is surprised he's angry, expecting him to be happy about her generosity.\n\nNow, the key points here: the wife gave away money without considering their financial constraints. The husband had already set a limit of $125/month, which they could manage, but the wife exceeded that significantly. The fact that they have to stretch a couple hundred dollars for the rest of the month means $200 is a substantial portion. The wife might have thought she was being generous, but her action left them with insufficient funds. The husband's reaction is based on financial responsibility, while the wife might feel her actions are altruistic. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's concerned about their shared finances and the wife made a decision that affects both of them without discussing it. On the other hand, the wife might argue she was inspired by his generosity. However, since the money given was significant and caused financial strain, the husband has a valid point about needing to be mindful of their budget. The wife should have communicated her intention to give a large amount, especially since it's a shared household budget. \n\nThe husband's anger isn't about the act of giving, but the amount given when they can't afford it. The wife gave without considering the immediate financial impact. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action was imprudent, so the husband's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
