We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They make $60k a year, $100k next year. Their expenses are rent, bills, student loans. End of the month they have a couple hundred left. So $200 is a significant chunk.\n\nThe author gives around $125 a month, which he sees as generous. The wife gave $200 in a week, which he found shocking. They argue, and she's upset he's mad. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to look at both sides. On one hand, giving to the homeless is a noble cause, and the wife is doing her part. The author appreciates her giving in the past but was caught off guard by the amount. On the other hand, the couple has a tight budget, and $200 is a large sum for them. The wife might not have considered the financial impact, especially if they have limited funds after paying rent and bills. \n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing financial stability over generosity, which is understandable given their income and expenses. However, the wife's actions might be motivated by compassion and a desire to help, which is also valid. The key here is whether the wife should have discussed such a large expenditure with her partner first, considering their shared financial responsibilities.\n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship usually require communication and agreement. If the wife gave away $200 without consulting, especially an amount that affects their monthly budget, that could be seen as irresponsible. However, the author's anger might come off as dismissive of her good intentions, but given their financial situation, his concern is justified.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong for being upset. If the wife's action was within their budget or if they have agreed on a way to handle such expenses, then the author might be wrong. But since they have a tight budget and the amount given was significant without prior discussion, the author's frustration is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The wife might share some responsibility for not communicating, but the author's reaction is also a matter of perspective. However, in terms of financial responsibility in a partnership, the author is justified in being upset because sudden large expenditures without discussion can be problematic. So, answer B.\n"
