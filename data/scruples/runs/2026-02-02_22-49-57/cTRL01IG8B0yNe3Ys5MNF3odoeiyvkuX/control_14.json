We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 rent and $500 other bills, leaving a couple hundred for food and other needs each month. The wife gave $200 all at once, which is a significant chunk of their remaining money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband feels that giving away $200 is irresponsible given their financial situation. They mentioned that they can barely afford their expenses, and this $200 could affect their budget until April 15th. On the other hand, the wife was inspired by the husband's own charitable actions. The husband gives around $125 a month, so she might have felt she was contributing more than him, hence the \"outran you\" comment. She might see her actions as helping those in need, which is a noble cause.\n\nBut the key here is financial responsibility. The husband is concerned about the family's budget, while the wife might not be considering the impact on their finances. The wife's action was spontaneous, giving all the money she had on hand, which might not have been discussed or planned together. The husband's reaction is frustration over unexpected financial strain, but he's also reacting to a significant amount. Whether he's wrong depends on whether he should have been more understanding of her charitable intent or if she should have considered their budget before giving so much.\n\nIn relationships, communication about finances is crucial. The wife might not have realized the impact, but the husband's anger over a large, unplanned expense could be seen as valid. However, his reaction of sleeping on the couch and the argument might have been harsh. But he's justified in being upset about the financial implications. Alternatively, the wife might have a right to feel her actions were good, but she should have discussed it with him first. \n\nConsidering all that, the husband's concern is valid because $200 is a large sum for their budget. The wife's action, while charitable, wasn't discussed, leading to financial strain. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as his reaction is based on financial responsibility. However, his handling of the situation could have been better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the primary issue is the wife's unplanned spending, so the husband is justified in being upset.\n"
