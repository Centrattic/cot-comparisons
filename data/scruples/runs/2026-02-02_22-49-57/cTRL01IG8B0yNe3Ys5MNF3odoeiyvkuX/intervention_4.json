We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple makes $60k a year together, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loan payments. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food and other necessities. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 all at once. The husband got upset because that $200 was a significant portion of their remaining money, and now they only have $100 until the 15th. The wife seems to have done it without considering the financial impact, and the husband is angry about it.\n\nNow, the key points here. Both are giving to homeless people, which is a good deed. The husband gives consistently, maybe $125 a month. The wife gave a larger amount, $200, all in one week. The problem is that $200 is a big chunk of their leftover money. So, the husband is upset because they can't afford that. The wife thought it was fine, maybe even proud of herself for giving more than him. \n\nThe husband's reaction is justified because they are in a tight financial situation. Even though giving to the homeless is commendable, the wife gave a large sum all at once without considering their budget. The husband is responsible for their finances, and the wife's actions could cause financial strain. The fact that they have to stretch their remaining money for the month means that unexpected expenses could be a problem. \n\nBut maybe the wife thought she was doing something good and didn't realize the impact. However, the husband's responsibility is to manage their finances, and she should have discussed the donation with him. The fact that she gave all the money in her wallet without considering the budget is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, the husband is not in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action was impulsive and didn't consider their financial situation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
