We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The couple makes $60k a year, with the husband to make $100k next year. They have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. At the end of the month, they have a couple hundred left for food and necessities. The wife gave $200 in one week, which seems like a significant chunk of their available funds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial situation. If they have only a couple hundred left after bills, giving away $200 would leave them with very little, maybe even causing financial strain. The husband gives around $125 a month, which is about $125 total, while the wife gave $200 in a week. That's a big difference and could be seen as irresponsible given their budget.\n\nThe wife's actions might be well-intentioned, but the husband is justified in being upset because they can't afford such a large expense. The key point here is whether the amount given is within their ability to spare. If giving $200 leaves them with only $100 until the next paycheck, that's a problem. Financial decisions in a relationship require mutual agreement and consideration of each other's concerns. The husband's reaction is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. The wife's surprise at his reaction suggests she didn't consider the financial implications as much as he did.\n\nThe husband isn't opposed to giving, as he does $125 a month. The issue is the sudden large amount from the wife without discussing it. This could lead to conflict if they don't communicate their financial priorities. So, the husband's anger is about the financial strain, not the altruism. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for being upset. The wife should have discussed such a large expenditure with him, especially given their tight budget.\n"
