We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They make $60k a year together, with the husband set to earn $100k alone next year. Their expenses are $1200 rent and $500 bills, so after that, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. \n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in a week. The key here is that $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. They mention they have only $100 left until April 15th after that. The wife's action might have caused financial strain, especially since they aren't in a position where they can spare that much without affecting their other needs.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong for being upset. The wife was surprised at his reaction, thinking he'd be happy. But the husband's concern is about financial responsibility. The wife giving away all her cash without discussing it might have been impulsive, especially if they weren't planning to allocate that much for charity that week. \n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship usually require communication. If the wife gave $200 without considering their budget, the husband's frustration is understandable. However, both have been giving to homeless people before, so maybe there's a prior understanding, but the amount here is a big jump. The husband might not be in the wrong because managing finances is part of a healthy relationship, and sudden large expenditures without discussion can cause issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions are also charitable, and the husband might need to be more understanding. But given the financial constraints, the husband's reaction seems reasonable. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
