We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple arguing over giving money to homeless people. The husband gives about $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week without telling him. They live in Chicago, make $60k a year combined, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are rent ($1200), bills ($500), student loans, and then they have a couple hundred left for food and other stuff.\n\nThe key points here are their financial situation and communication. They're on a tight budget. Giving $200 all at once from their limited discretionary funds is a big hit. The wife gave all the money in her wallet to homeless people, which the husband saw as irresponsible because they can't afford that. The husband is upset because that $200 is a significant portion of their available money each month. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of compassion and charitable giving. The wife was trying to do something kind, and maybe the husband didn't expect her to give so much. The question is whether the husband was wrong to be upset. \n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship usually require communication and agreement. If the wife gave away $200 without discussing it, especially knowing their budget constraints, then the husband's anger is understandable. However, the wife might feel that helping others is important and that the husband is being too strict. \n\nThe husband's reaction might be seen as being in the right because they need to manage their finances carefully. On the other hand, if the wife had discussed it first, maybe he would have been okay. But since she didn't, and it caused a strain on their finances, it's more about how decisions are made in a relationship. \n\nSo considering the financial context and the lack of communication, the husband isn't wrong for being upset. The wife should have discussed the large donation before doing it. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
