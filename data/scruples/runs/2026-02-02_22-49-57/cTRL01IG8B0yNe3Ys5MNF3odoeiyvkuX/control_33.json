We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, their financial situation: they make $60k a year together, with the husband set to make $100k next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. After that, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant portion of their remaining budget. The husband gives around $125 a month, which he considers manageable. The wife gave $200 in one week, which the husband feels is excessive given their finances.\n\nThe wife seems to have admired his charity and started doing it too, but she gave all the money in her wallet. The husband is upset because this $200 reduces their already tight funds until the 15th. The wife is upset that he was angry, expecting him to be supportive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. On one hand, giving to homeless people is a kind act, and the wife's motivation is noble. But on the other hand, the husband is concerned about their financial stability. The key points here are communication and financial planning. If they hadn't discussed their budgeting for charitable giving, then both might share some responsibility. However, the wife gave a large sum without considering the impact on their budget, which the husband finds irresponsible. The husband's reaction, while maybe harsh, is based on financial constraints. The wife might have expected more flexibility, but the husband's perspective is valid given their circumstances. It's a conflict between compassion and fiscal responsibility. Since they are a couple, they should ideally discuss and agree on how much to give. The husband's anger stems from financial reality, so he's not entirely wrong. However, maybe he could have handled it better. But overall, considering the financial strain, he's not in the wrong.\n"
