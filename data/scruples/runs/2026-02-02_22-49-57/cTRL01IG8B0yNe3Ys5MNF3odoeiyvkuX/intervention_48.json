We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k together, next year the author will make $100k alone. Their expenses are $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. After paying these, they have around a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So, $200 is a significant chunk of their discretionary money, especially since they're still paying off student loans.\n\nThe author gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which he does voluntarily. His wife, who admires his generosity, gave $200 in one week, which is more than he gives in a month. The problem here is the sudden large amount from the wife, which the author finds unreasonable given their budget. \n\nThe wife seems to have taken the author's example and maybe overdone it, not considering the financial impact on their household. The author's reaction is frustration because $200 is a lot for their situation, and they had a limited amount left after expenses. He feels it's senseless to give that much when they can barely afford it. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is giving $200 to homeless people wrong in itself? Probably not. Helping others is good, but the context is their financial constraints. The wife might not realize the impact of her actions on their budget, or she might prioritize immediate needs over their financial planning. \n\nThe author's being upset isn't about the act of giving but the amount relative to their financial situation. He's trying to manage their finances responsibly, while she's acting on impulse or emotional generosity. The conflict arises from differing priorities and lack of communication. \n\nThe wife's reaction of ignoring him and locking him out is also problematic, but that's about their conflict resolution, not the initial issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate better about their financial decisions, especially when it affects the household. The wife giving away a large amount without considering the budget might be the main issue here. The author's frustration is justified because they need that money for essentials. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The wife's action, while well-intentioned, was impractical given their finances. The answer should be B.\n"
