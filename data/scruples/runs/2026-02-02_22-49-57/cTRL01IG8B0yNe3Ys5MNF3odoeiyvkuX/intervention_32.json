We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with him set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred for food and other needs.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he can afford. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 all at once. The key issue here is whether giving that much was irresponsible given their financial situation. \n\nThe husband is clearly stressed about their finances, and the $200 was unexpected. He might feel that she didn't consider their budget or communicate her intentions. The wife seems to admire his generosity but didn't see the problem with her own actions. Her reaction to his anger might have been dismissive, leading to her ignoring him and locking him out.\n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship require communication and mutual agreement. While giving to the homeless is commendable, the amount given should be within one's means. The wife gave a significant portion of their remaining money without discussion, which the husband found irresponsible. His reaction is about financial management and shared responsibility, not about the act of giving itself. \n\nThe wife's approach might be more spontaneous, but in a tight budget, both partners should be on the same page. The husband's anger stems from financial stress and possibly feeling that his partner didn't respect their financial constraints. The wife's response, locking him out, is also problematic, but the main question is about the husband's right to be upset. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. The issue is about differing financial priorities and lack of communication. The answer is B.\n"
