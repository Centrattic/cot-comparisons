We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple in Chicago who are struggling financially. They make around $60k a year together, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. \n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which the wife admires and has started doing herself. She gives them her lunch or small amounts. But then she gives away $200 in one go without discussing it with him, which he sees as irresponsible because that money is needed for their own expenses. He gets angry, they argue, and she's been ignoring him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset about the $200. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial situation. They can't afford to give away large sums without affecting their own needs. The wife's action used up a significant portion of their remaining money, which the husband views as senseless. On the other hand, the wife is trying to be charitable, which is a positive thing, but maybe without considering their financial constraints.\n\nThe husband might feel that they should be on the same page about their spending, especially on charity. If they have agreed on a budget or limits, then the wife going over that could be an issue. However, if they haven't discussed it, maybe the husband's reaction is a bit harsh. \n\nBut given that they have a tight budget, $200 is a lot. If they have only $100 left until the next pay, losing $200 could cause real problems. The husband's anger is based on the immediate impact on their finances. The wife might feel that helping others is important, but the husband is concerned about their own stability.\n\nI think the key here is shared responsibility in a relationship. Both should communicate about financial decisions, especially when it's a significant portion of their income. The wife did give away the money without consulting him, which might be disrespectful to his feelings. However, the husband's reaction of being angry and making her sleep on the couch might be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut considering their financial situation, the husband's reaction is understandable. He's worried about their ability to meet their needs. The wife's action, while charitable, might not be sustainable given their income. The question is whether the husband is wrong for being upset. I think he's not in the wrong because the financial impact is real. However, he could have handled the argument better. The wife should have discussed it with him first.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the husband's reaction is justified given their financial constraints, and the wife's action wasn't discussed beforehand.\n"
