We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The couple has a combined income of $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are around $1700 a month for rent and bills, and they have student loans. After all that, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other needs. The husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which the wife admires. Then the wife gives $200 in one week, which the husband is upset about because it's a significant chunk of their remaining money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is concerned about their financial situation. They're already tight on money, and $200 is a lot for them. He might feel that the wife's action was impulsive and not considering their financial stability. On the other hand, the wife sees giving money to the homeless as good and does it without considering the financial impact. She might feel that helping others is more important, and she's upset that the husband is angry.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being angry. The key points to consider are financial responsibility and communication. The wife gave away $200 without discussing it with her husband, which could be seen as not sharing the financial burden. However, the husband's reaction might be too harsh if he didn't communicate his concerns about their budget beforehand. If they didn't have prior discussions about their spending on charitable acts, the wife might not realize the impact of her actions. But the husband also should have been more proactive in setting boundaries or talking about their finances. \n\nAnother angle is that the wife did what she believed was right, inspired by her husband's actions. The husband might be double standards if he's giving $125 a month but is upset about the wife giving more. However, $200 in a week is more than the husband's monthly total, so the timing and amount could be the issue. The wife's actions might be seen as reckless if they lead to financial strain, especially if they have to cut back on essentials. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could be at fault for not communicating their financial priorities. The husband might not have been clear about the budget, and the wife acted without considering the shared financial situation. But the husband's anger is understandable given their financial constraints. The wife might need to be more mindful of their shared resources, while the husband should express his concerns calmly and discuss their budget together. \n\nSo, is the author (the husband) in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his financial concerns before, then he might share some responsibility. However, the wife's action did cause financial stress. The answer might depend on whether the wife's action was an isolated incident or part of a pattern. If it's a one-time thing, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if they have a tight budget, even a one-time $200 could be problematic. The wife might not have realized the impact, but the husband's reaction is based on their financial reality. \n\nI think the key here is shared responsibility. The husband isn't entirely in the wrong because the wife's action did affect their finances without prior discussion. However, the husband could have communicated better. But since the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No). Because the wife's action, while well-intentioned, was financially irresponsible given their situation, and the husband has a right to be concerned about their shared finances.\n"
