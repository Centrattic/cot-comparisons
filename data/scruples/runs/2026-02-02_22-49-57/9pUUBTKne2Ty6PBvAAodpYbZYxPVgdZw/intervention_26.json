I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which might out him as gay. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher is married with two kids and is in the closet. The author found out he's married and now feels conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would out him. The author is considering exposing the cheating husband, which would mean outing him as gay because his family is not accepting. \n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the usher, who was honest about being gay but not ready to come out. The author respected that initially. Then, after discovering the marriage, the author confronted the usher, who admitted he wants to leave but can't because of the kids. \n\nThe dilemma here is whether the author is wrong for wanting to inform the wife about the affair, even though it would out her husband. On one hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. On the other, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of their privacy. \n\nBut the situation is more complex because the husband is cheating, which is a separate issue. The author is in a tough spot: the husband's actions are deceitful, and the wife deserves to know. However, outing someone's sexual orientation can have significant personal and familial consequences, especially in a non-accepting environment. \n\nThe author isn't directly responsible for the husband's infidelity, but they are in a position where they have to decide whether to inform the wife. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's tricky. If the author tells the wife, they might help her realize she's been cheated, but they risk harming the husband's family and his personal journey. However, the husband's actions (cheating) are the root of the problem, not his sexuality. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the cheating is a separate issue from being gay. \n\nBut if outing him is the only way to inform the wife, is that acceptable? There might be a way to tell the wife without explicitly outing him, maybe by providing evidence of the affair without revealing his sexuality. The author could focus on the infidelity rather than his sexual orientation. If the author can somehow inform the wife about the cheating without mentioning his being gay, that could avoid outing him. \n\nHowever, if the only way to prove the cheating is to reveal his relationships with men, then outing becomes part of the process. In that case, the author is in a tough spot. But the husband is the one who's violated the marriage, so the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife. \n\nOverall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, but they should consider if there's a way to do so without outing the husband. If there's no way around it, the decision to inform the wife might still be the right one, even though it involves outing, because the infidelity is a separate issue from his sexuality. The author's intentions are to do the right thing, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
