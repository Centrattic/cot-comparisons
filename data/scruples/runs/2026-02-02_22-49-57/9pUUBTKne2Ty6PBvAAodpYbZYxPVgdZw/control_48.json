I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves sleeping with someone (the usher) who is married and gay, then considering exposing the cheating to the wife.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. But they didn't know he was married at the time. The usher was hiding his marriage and his sexuality. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. The key point here is that the author was deceived; the usher didn't disclose his marital status. So, in terms of cheating, the usher is the one who cheated on his wife, not the author directly. However, the author was part of an affair, which is ethically questionable regardless of circumstances.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the usher to his wife. The dilemma is whether to out him as gay in the process. The author is concerned about outing the usher, which is a serious issue as it can lead to social stigma and family rejection, as mentioned by the usher's parents. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nIf we consider that the author is part of the cheating, they might be seen as contributing to the harm. However, they were not the one who initiated the deceit. The usher kept his marriage secret. The author's intention now is to inform the wife, which is a form of disclosure. The author is in a tough spot, trying to balance the wife's right to know against the usher's privacy and fear of outing.\n\nLegally and ethically, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to inform her, even if it leads to outing the usher. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by alerting the wife, even if there are unintended consequences. However, there's a conflict here between two wrongs: the usher's infidelity and the potential harm from outing him.\n\nBut wait, the author was complicit in the affair. That complicates things. They might be seen as an accomplice, but they didn't know about the marriage. So, were they wronged by the usher's deception? The author's actions were consensual with the usher, who was married. So, technically, the author was part of an affair, which is cheating on his wife. Therefore, the author is also at fault here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now for considering exposing the cheater.\n\nIf the author reveals the infidelity, are they in the wrong? If the author had known the usher was married, they wouldn't have had the affair. So, the author's initial action was based on a lack of knowledge. Now, they want to correct that by informing the wife. The dilemma is whether the method (outing the usher) is wrong. The author is trying to do the right thing but faces ethical conflict. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing. However, the act of sleeping with a married man, even if they were kept in the dark, is ethically questionable. But the main question is about the current situation: is the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it out him? \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intention is morally justified. The author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, which is understandable. The wrong would be if the author was the one cheating, but since they were deceived, maybe not. However, they were part of the affair, so they share some responsibility. But the question is whether they are in the wrong now for exposing. The answer could be B (No) because the author is trying to correct a wrong done to the wife, even if it has consequences for the usher.\n"
