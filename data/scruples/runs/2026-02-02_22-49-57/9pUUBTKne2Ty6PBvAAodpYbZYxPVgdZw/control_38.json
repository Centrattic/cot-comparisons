I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves them having a relationship with a married man who's in the closet about being gay, and now they're considering exposing him as a cheater, which would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 20-year-old who slept with a 23-year-old usher at their best friend's sister's wedding. The usher is married with two children and the wife was out of the country. The author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship and now feels guilty because they were cheated on before. They confronted him, and he's considering leaving his wife but is held back by his kids. The author is conflicted between not outing him (due to his parents' potential reaction) and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at their actions. The author had a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. Even if the man was also cheating, that doesn't make it right for the author. The fact that he's gay and in the closet complicates things, but the author was aware of his marital status? Wait, no, the author says they didn't know he was married when they started sleeping with him. Wait, the usher is married, and the wife was out of the country for work. The author didn't know this when they first had sex. So maybe the author's mistake was not knowing whether he was married or not. But the author was at the wedding of their best friend's sister, so the usher would be part of the wedding, but the author didn't ask about his relationship status. \n\nBut the author is now considering exposing him. The dilemma is between outing him (which might hurt his family) and the wife's right to know. The author is being asked if they would be in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which would out him. \n\nThe question is about the author's current situation\u2014whether they're in the wrong if they decide to expose him. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author had a relationship with someone who was married without knowing. That's the first point. Now, if they expose him, they're revealing his infidelity, which also reveals he's gay. The wife has a right to know about the cheating, but the author is also outing him. \n\nBut the author's initial action was to engage in a sexual relationship with a married man. So even if they are planning to expose him, the fact that they were involved in an affair is problematic. \n\nThe options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). The key is whether the author is in the wrong for the situation as a whole. \n\nThe author's actions (cheating on the man's wife) are wrong regardless of the exposure. So even if they plan to expose him afterward, the initial relationship was a mistake. \n\nBut the user's question is specifically about the exposure part. The title asks if WIBTA (Would I Be the Asshole) for exposing the cheater, which would out him. \n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing him. The answer would depend on if the exposure is justified. \n\nHowever, the author was in a consensual relationship with the married man, which is also cheating. So their initial actions are wrong. \n\nBut the question is about the current dilemma: if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nIf the author is considering exposing him to the wife, that's a different action. But the author is also a participant in the cheating. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is in the wrong for being in the relationship, then even if they expose him, their initial actions make them at least partially responsible. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the current situation of exposing him. \n\nThe options are A or B. \n\nIn the scenario, the author is in love with the man, has hooked up multiple times, and now wants to tell the wife. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for the exposure if the husband is cheating, but the author's participation in the affair is problematic. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong for exposing. \n\nIf the husband is a cheater, the author might think they have a duty to inform the wife. However, outing him could have severe consequences. \n\nBut the author is also part of the problem since they engaged in the affair. \n\nSo, in the WIBTA context, the community often judges whether the person is the asshole in their current action. If the author is now considering exposing him, the question is whether that makes them the asshole. \n\nGiven that the author was in the affair, they might be seen as complicit. But if they expose him to prevent further harm, maybe not. \n\nBut the fact that the author is trying to expose someone they were having an affair with could be seen as self-serving. \n\nHowever, the husband is the one who cheated, and the author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. \n\nThe initial mistake was the affair, but the exposure might be a way to make amends. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for the current action of exposing? Possibly not, but the initial affair was wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. The user's actions (cheating and then deciding to expose) are two parts. \n\nIf the user is being asked whether they are in the wrong for exposing, but their initial decision to have an affair is part of the context. \n\nSo the answer would be A (yes) because the author was in a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. Even if they later decide to expose him, the initial act of cheating is where they're at fault. \n\nAlternatively, if the focus is solely on the exposure part, maybe not. But the WIBTA question is about the entire situation. \n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n"
