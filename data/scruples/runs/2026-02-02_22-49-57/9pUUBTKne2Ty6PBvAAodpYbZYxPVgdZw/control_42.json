I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex with multiple layers.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who's married and gay, and they've been sleeping multiple times. The author is now conflicted because they found out the man is married and cheating. The key points here are the ethics of exposing someone's infidelity versus outing them as gay, especially considering family dynamics and potential harm.\n\nThe author is considering telling the wife about the cheating, which would necessarily out him since he's having an affair. The man is in the closet, and his parents might not accept his sexuality. The author is torn between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the potential harm of outing him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the man is cheating, which is a violation of his marriage. The author was in a consensual relationship with him, but the fact that he's married complicates things. The author might feel a duty to inform the wife about the cheating, but doing so would out him as gay. However, the author could argue they're not at fault because the cheating is the man's responsibility, not theirs. But by engaging in the affair, the author is complicit in the cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not know if the man is the only one he's cheating with. The author's intent is to protect the wife but also respects the man's privacy. However, outing someone to expose cheating might not be the best approach. There's also the risk of causing family issues. \n\nThe author's actions depend on their intent. If they're trying to protect the wife, maybe they're not entirely wrong, but they are involved in the cheating as well. The dilemma is between two wrongs: cheating and outing. The author isn't responsible for the man's closeted status, but their decision to expose the cheating while outing him could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a tough spot. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method (outing) could be problematic. However, since the affair is ongoing and the man is cheating, the author's role in it complicates things. So, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are justified. If they're complicit in the cheating, they might share some responsibility. But if their intent is purely to inform the wife about the infidelity, perhaps they're not entirely at fault. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the primary wrong is the cheating, and the author is trying to address it despite the complexities.\n"
