I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay if he's not out yet. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone they knew was married. They found out the man was cheating, and now they're torn between telling the wife (which would out him) and keeping quiet. The key points here are the ethics of exposing someone's infidelity versus respecting their privacy, especially regarding their sexual orientation.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel a duty to the wife to inform her about the cheating. Infidelity is a serious matter, and the wife has a right to know if she's being deceived. However, the complication here is that revealing the cheating would also out the man as gay, which he hasn't done yet. The author is concerned about his family's reaction and the potential harm that outing him might cause.\n\nBut the author also acknowledges that they were in a consensual relationship with the man, who was in a committed marriage. The fact that they were in a relationship with someone who is married is problematic. If the author is the one who initiated or continued the relationship, they might share some responsibility for the situation. However, the main question is about whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing the man's cheating.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between two wrongs: out someone who's being closeted, or let someone else continue to be cheated on. It's a tough spot. The author's intent is to do the right thing, but the method might have unintended consequences. They also mention that the married man is in a vulnerable position, especially with his family's potential reaction. \n\nIn some moral frameworks, honesty is valued, so the wife has a right to know. But in others, respecting the man's privacy (especially his sexual orientation) is more important. There's also the question of whether the author has the right to intervene in someone else's marriage. \n\nIf the author didn't know about the marriage initially and got into a relationship, that complicates things. But they found out later and are now trying to make things right. The key is whether the author's actions are malicious or genuinely trying to prevent harm. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, especially if there's a genuine intent to help. However, the act of exposing someone's infidelity while also outing their sexuality might be seen as crossing a line, depending on the circumstances. The author should consider if there's a way to inform the wife without directly outing him, but if not, they might be in a no-win situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's intent is to prevent harm (to the wife) versus respecting the man's privacy. If the author is acting in good faith and there's no other way, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, perhaps they should try that first. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering it, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because their intent is to do the right thing, even if the method is complex.\n"
