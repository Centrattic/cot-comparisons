I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had multiple affairs with a married man, then found out he's cheating and is in the closet. The author is now considering exposing the cheater, which would out him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was in a consensual relationship with someone who's married and gay, and now wants to inform the wife about the cheating. The dilemma is whether exposing the cheater (which would reveal his sexuality) is the right move.\n\nMoral aspects: The author is considering the wife's right to know about the infidelity, which is a valid point. Cheating is a serious betrayal. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is also a big deal. The man is in the closet, and his family might not accept his sexuality, so outing him could cause personal and family problems. \n\nThe author also mentions that the man is in a difficult position with his family and kids. The author might feel conflicted between the wife's rights and the man's privacy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial relationship was non-consensual because the man was married. The author didn't know he was married when they started, but once found out, continuing the relationship was unethical. However, the author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. \n\nBut by exposing the cheater, the author would be outing him, which could lead to public shaming or family issues. The question is whether the author has the right to do that. In some cultures, coming out is a personal choice, and outing someone is a violation of privacy. \n\nHowever, the wife has a right to know about the cheating. The challenge is to report the cheating without necessarily outing him as gay. For example, the author could contact the wife anonymously and provide evidence of the infidelity without revealing his sexuality. That way, the wife is informed, but the man isn't outed. \n\nIf the author decides to out him while informing the wife, that's where the moral dilemma lies. The author might be justified in wanting to stop the cheating but could be overstepping by revealing personal info. \n\nSo, the key factors are: the right to privacy vs. the right to know, the potential harm of outing, and the ethical obligation to report cheating. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method (outing) might be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the author can report the infidelity without outing the man. If the author can't do that and must out him, there's a conflict. But if they can find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, that's better. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater by outing him. If the author does out him, that's problematic. But if they can do it without outing, maybe not. \n\nBut the scenario says \"if it meant outing him in the process,\" so the author is considering exposing the cheating by outing. In that case, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because outing someone without their consent is a violation of privacy, even if the intent is to stop cheating. The right approach would be to inform the wife anonymously about the cheating without revealing his sexuality. Therefore, the author is in the wrong if they choose to out him. So the answer is A.\n"
