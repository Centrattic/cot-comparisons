I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him as gay. The author had an affair with a married man who is in the closet. The author is conflicted between the husband's right to privacy and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nFirst, the man is cheating on his wife, which is unethical and could cause her harm. The author discovered this and wants to inform the wife. However, doing so would out him as gay, which he hasn't come out about. The dilemma is whether the moral obligation to the wife outweighs the harm of outing someone who isn't ready.\n\nThe author tried to respect the man's privacy initially by keeping their relationship secret. Now, they're in a tough spot because the man is cheating, and the author is a witness. Legally, the author isn't obligated to report this. Ethically, it's more complex. The author might feel responsible because their actions contributed to the cheating, but they also have a right to their own privacy and the man's lack of transparency complicates things.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, it would protect the wife's rights but potentially harm the man's family and personal life. If they don't, the wife remains unaware of the betrayal. The author's intent is to inform the wife without outing the man, which might not be possible here. Given that the man is married with kids and closeted, the author's decision could have significant consequences for all parties involved.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife. However, the act of informing the wife, which would involve outing the man, could be seen as violating his privacy. But since the man was deceptive about his relationship status, the author might have a duty to the wife. The answer depends on weighing the harm of keeping secrets versus the harm of exposure. Given the complexity, the author's position is understandable, so the answer is B.\n"
