I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're wrong for wanting to expose a cheater, which would also out him as gay. So the situation is that they had an affair with someone who's married and gay, and now they're conflicted about whether to tell the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The person had a relationship with a married man, which is cheating. The man is in the closet, so coming out isn't easy for him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to tell the wife, thus outing him.\n\nThe author's actions: they had consensual encounters with a married man. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author found out later. Now they want to inform the wife but are worried about outing him. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were part of the cheating relationship. But the key point is whether they have the right to expose him. Legally, in many places, adultery isn't a crime, so the author isn't legally obligated to report it. Ethically, it's more complex. The wife has a right to know if she's being cheated on, but the author isn't the one to decide to inform her. Additionally, outing someone without their consent is a violation of privacy, especially if they're in the closet. The author might be causing harm to the man's family by outing him, which could have serious consequences given the family's traditional views.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they have a moral duty to the wife, but they weren't wronged directly. The wife's husband cheated on her, but the author isn't the one to take responsibility for that. The author's own actions (cheating) are problematic, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong to want to inform the wife. However, the act of informing the wife would also reveal the man's sexuality, which complicates things. The author might be using the wife's right to know as a justification for outing him, which could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. Their actions of cheating are questionable, but the main issue is whether they have the right to expose the man. Since they're not a party to the marriage, they don't have the authority to decide to inform the wife. They could consider a way to inform the wife anonymously, perhaps through a letter or hiring a private investigator, but that's not addressed here. The answer depends on whether the author's intent is to help the wife or to expose the man's sexuality. Since the author is also complicit in the cheating, they might be overstepping by taking it upon themselves to act as a whistleblower. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for both the initial cheating and for planning to out someone, even if their intentions are mixed. But the main question is if they're wrong for exposing the cheater, which would involve outing him. Since outing someone without consent is generally considered wrong, even if the intent is to report cheating, the author might be in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
