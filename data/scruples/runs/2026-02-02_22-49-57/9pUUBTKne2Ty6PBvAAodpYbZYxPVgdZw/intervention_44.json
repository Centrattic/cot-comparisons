I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The scenario involves the author having an affair with a married man who is in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and the author is conflicted between wanting to tell the wife and not wanting to out him.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they were involved in a relationship knowing the man was married but not aware of his sexuality initially. The man asked them not to reveal his sexual orientation. Now, the author is considering exposing the infidelity to the wife but that would also out him. \n\nThe key points here are consent and harm. The author had consensual relationships with the man, but it's clear the man is in a committed marriage. The author didn't know he was married at the start, which complicates things. But once they found out, they had a duty to consider the wife's rights. \n\nThe dilemma is between the man's privacy (as a closeted gay person) and the wife's right to know she's being cheated on. The author is trying to balance these two. Legally, the affair is consensual between adults, but ethically, there's a question about informing the spouse. \n\nHowever, the author is not the one who started the cheating; the man did. The author's responsibility to the wife is to inform her about the infidelity, but doing so would out him. The author is in a tough spot because they care about the man's privacy but also the wife's right to know. \n\nIs the author in the wrong if they choose to inform the wife? Well, they didn't commit the infidelity themselves. They were part of it, but the main cheater is the man. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, even if it means outing him. The wrong here is the man for cheating and not coming out. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's a difficult decision. \n\nSo the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are navigating a complex moral situation where they're trying to balance two conflicting duties without being the initial wrongdoer.\n"
