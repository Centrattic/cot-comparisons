I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author had a series of affairs with a married man who's also gay and closeted. The man asked them not to tell anyone because he's not ready to come out. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to inform the man's wife about the cheating, which would out him, or keep quiet.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where they were involved with someone who was married. The man is the one who's cheating, so the author isn't the one who initiated the marriage. But they were aware he was married and continued the relationship. That's a problem because they were part of an affair. The man is also hiding his sexuality, which complicates things.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. They're considering exposing the cheater by telling the wife, which would out him. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is wrong, but the author is the one who had the affair. However, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. The author might feel a duty to inform her. But doing so would out the man as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is in a tough spot between the wife's right to know and respecting the man's privacy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The initial act of having an affair with a married man is questionable. But the dilemma here is about the next step. The author isn't the one who's married; they're the one who had the affair. However, by continuing the relationship knowing he's married, they were part of the cheating. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they're trying to do the right thing by the wife but at the cost of the man's privacy. If they don't, they might be enabling the cheating. But the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. However, the act of exposing someone's infidelity is a complex issue. \n\nThe key points: the author was part of an affair, but the main issue is their current dilemma. They are not the one who's married, so they aren't the cheater's spouse. The author might feel they have a moral obligation to the wife, but they are also respecting the man's request for privacy. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's initial actions (cheating) are problematic, but the question is about the current situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. Since the author isn't the one who's married and the cheating was mutual (from the man's side), the author's decision to inform the wife could be seen as trying to do the right thing. However, they are also complicating the man's personal life by outing him. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for considering to inform the wife, even though their initial actions were ethically questionable. The dilemma is about balancing two wrongs: the man's cheating and the potential outing. The author's intent here is to protect the wife, which could be seen as the right action despite the consequences for the man.\n"
