I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is someone who had a series of sexual encounters with a married man who's also in the closet about his sexuality. They met at a wedding, slept together, and continued the relationship multiple times. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to expose the man's infidelity and his sexuality, knowing that outing him could cause family issues, but the wife has a right to know about the cheating.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had multiple affairs with a married person. That's definitely a problem. The man was in the closet, and the author agreed not to out him. But the main issue here is the author's current dilemma about whether to tell the wife. Exposing the man would mean revealing his infidelity and his sexuality, which he hasn't come out about. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were part of an affair. That's not okay. But now they're trying to do the right thing by the wife. However, the author isn't the one who cheated; the man did. The author's problem is whether they have a duty to inform the wife. But the author's initial actions (cheating) are their fault. They didn't know he was married, but they continued the relationship once they found out? Wait, no\u2014wait, the author found out a week ago that he was married. So they had five more encounters after the wedding? Wait, the first time was at the wedding afterparty. Then they became friends and hooked up five more times. So from the wedding (which was a month ago) to now, they had five more times, and a week ago is when they found out he's married. So the author didn't know he was married when they first slept with him, and then continued after finding out? Or did they find out after the first time but before the five more encounters?\n\nThe timeline is a bit confusing. The author says they found out a week ago that he's married. The wedding was a month ago. So maybe they found out recently that he's married, and after that, they had five more encounters? Wait, no. Wait, the first encounter was at the wedding afterparty. Then they became friends and hooked up five more times. Then a week ago, the author found out he's married. Wait, that would mean the author found out after the initial encounter but before the five more? That doesn't make sense. If the first time was at the wedding, then the author found out a week ago (which is a month after the wedding) that he's married. So the five more encounters happened after the wedding but before the author found out. So the author didn't know he was married when they had the five encounters. They only found out a week ago, which is now. So the author's five more times were before they knew he was married. Then, upon finding out, they confronted him. \n\nSo, in that case, the author was in an affair with a married man, not knowing he was married. But once they found out, they confronted him. Now, they're considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him as gay. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author made a mistake by getting involved with someone they thought was single but was actually married. However, they were misled by the man. The author's intention now is to inform the wife, which is a moral action because the wife deserves to know about the infidelity. However, this action would also out the man, which he's not ready to do. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They had an affair (which is their fault), but now they're trying to set things right by informing the wife. The dilemma is between the man's right to privacy (regarding his sexuality) and the wife's right to know about the cheating. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The wrong would be their participation in the affair. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong now in considering exposing him. \n\nIf the author is now trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it means outing him, then perhaps they are not in the wrong. But they are in the wrong for the affair. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the current situation of considering exposure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were deceived. The man lied about his relationship status and sexuality. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. Now, they want to correct the wrong by informing the wife, even if it out him. \n\nHowever, the author's initial involvement in the affair is their mistake. But the current decision to inform the wife is a moral choice. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is trying to do the right thing now, despite their initial mistake.\n"
