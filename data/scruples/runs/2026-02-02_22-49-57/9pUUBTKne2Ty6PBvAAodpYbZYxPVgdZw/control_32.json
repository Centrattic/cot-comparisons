I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sexual relationship with a man who is married and in the closet. The man asked the author not to tell anyone because he's still in the closet. Now the author found out he's married with kids and is conflicted about whether to tell the wife he's been cheated on.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had multiple affairs with a married man, which is a form of cheating. The man was in the closet, so the author knew he wasn't out yet. The author might be complicit in the man's infidelity. The man is the one who's cheating on his wife, which is the wrong action here. But the author is now considering exposing this to the wife, which would out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose this.\n\nThe author is in a dilemma: they feel bad about the cheating and want to do the right thing by the wife, but they don't want to out the man. However, the author's own actions in having the affair are problematic. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the author might share some responsibility for participating in the cheating. But the main issue is the man's infidelity. The author's potential action of telling the wife could be seen as a moral obligation to protect the wife, even if it out the man. However, the author is also complicit in the affair, which could make them partly responsible.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is considering exposing the infidelity to the wife, even if it out the man, is that wrong? The author's main conflict is between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. However, the author's own actions in the affair are a red flag. So, they might be in the wrong for being involved in the affair in the first place. But the question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong now for wanting to expose the cheater. The answer might depend on the consequences. If the author is now trying to take responsibility by informing the wife, maybe they're trying to do the right thing despite their own role in the infidelity. But they could be in the wrong for both participating in the affair and for deciding to out the man, which could have severe consequences for him. Alternatively, the author's intent is to protect the wife, which is a positive action. It's a complex situation where the author's actions have multiple layers of right and wrong. The main wrong here is the man's infidelity, but the author is also involved. The decision to expose might be the right thing for the wife's sake, but the author's own actions are questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. Since the author is trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, even if it out the man, the answer might be no. But if the author is trying to expose the man for their own reasons (like guilt), that could be wrong. The key is the author's intent and the consequences. It's a tough call, but considering the author is trying to do the right thing for the wife, maybe they are not in the wrong. But the initial affair is definitely a problem. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the current situation of considering exposure. So, the answer might be no because the author is trying to report the infidelity, which is the right action, despite their own past actions.\n"
