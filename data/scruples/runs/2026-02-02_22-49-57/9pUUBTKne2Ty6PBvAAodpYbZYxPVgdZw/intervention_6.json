I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a relationship with someone they met at a wedding, who later turned out to be married. The person is also gay and in the closet. The author is now conflicted about whether to expose the cheating husband, which would out him as gay, or stay silent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship. They were told he was gay but in the closet. Now they're worried about the wife's right to know versus the husband's right to privacy. \n\nOn one hand, the husband is cheating, which is a violation of his marriage. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without their consent can be a major privacy violation, especially if the family is not accepting. The author is trying to balance these two things. \n\nThe author confronted the man, and he broke down, indicating he's conflicted too. The author feels responsibility because they were part of the cheating. But they also respect his privacy. \n\nIs it the author's duty to tell the wife? Not necessarily. They aren't directly involved in the marriage. However, they might feel a moral obligation because they were part of the affair. But outing him could cause family issues and maybe harm the man. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for considering it, but actually taking action to expose him would be complicated. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for wanting to do it. It's a tough spot. Maybe there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, but the author is worried that's not possible. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to do the right thing despite the dilemma. They didn't know about the marriage initially, and now they want to inform the wife, which is understandable. The wrongness would come if they acted recklessly, but the question is about being in the wrong in general. Since they're conflicted and trying to act responsibly, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
