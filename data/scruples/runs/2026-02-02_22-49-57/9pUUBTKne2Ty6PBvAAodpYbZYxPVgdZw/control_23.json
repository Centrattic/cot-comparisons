I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author had an affair with this guy who's married and gay, and now they're trying to decide whether to tell the wife.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA) for exposing the cheater, which would out him. The guy is in the closet, so outing him is a big deal. The author is conflicted because they care about the guy's well-being but also feel that the wife has a right to know about the cheating.\n\nThe author's actions: They had multiple affairs with a married man, which is cheating. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for considering exposing him. The key points here are the moral obligations. The author is in a dilemma between protecting the cheater's privacy (since he's gay and closeted) and informing the wife about the infidelity.\n\nThe author did promise not to tell anyone about the affair initially. They kept it secret for a while but now found out he's married. The author is considering breaking that promise to tell the wife. But the problem is that telling the wife would out him, which he's not ready for. So the author's main conflict is between honesty and respecting the person's privacy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were part of an affair themselves, which is ethically questionable. But the main question is about whether they're wrong for potentially exposing him. The WIBTA aspect is about whether they'd be wrong for revealing the cheating, which might out him.\n\nOn one hand, the wife has a right to know. On the other, outing someone against their will is a violation of their privacy. The author might be in the wrong because they're using the wife as a conduit to out the man, which could harm him. However, the author might argue that the wife deserves to know about the cheating, even if it means outing him.\n\nBut the author's own actions (cheating) are part of the story. They might be in a position where they're complicit in the cheating and then want to report it. But the question is not about their own actions but whether they're wrong for exposing the cheater. So, the answer hinges on whether they have the right to inform the wife without the man's consent, which would out him.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, outing someone without their consent is a violation unless there's a compelling reason. Here, the author's reason is to inform the wife about the cheating. However, there might be other ways to inform the wife without outing the man, like using his Grindr account as evidence but not revealing his identity. But if the only way is to out him, then the author is causing harm to him. So the author might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing the wife's rights over the man's privacy, especially when the man is not ready to come out. The author's own actions (cheating) also add complexity, but the main issue is the potential outing.\n\nTherefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they would be outing someone against their will, which is a serious violation, even if their intention is to inform the wife.\n"
