I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would involve outing him. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They found out he's married with kids and cheated on his wife. The author is conflicted between exposing him to his wife (which would out him as gay) and keeping it secret to protect his family.\n\nThe key points here are consent and harm. The author initially agreed not to tell anyone because the man was closeted. But then they discovered he's cheating. The author's dilemma is between the man's privacy and the wife's right to know.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are outing him, which could cause family issues. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author might be justified in wanting to protect the wife from being cheated on. But outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a serious matter, even if the intent is good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was also complicit in the affair and might share some responsibility. But they didn't know he was married initially. The main issue is whether exposing the cheating justifies outing him. It's a tough call. Some might say the author has a duty to the wife, others might prioritize the man's privacy.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate. Telling the wife would indeed out him, which is a big deal. Maybe there's a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality? But the author isn't sure. If outing is unavoidable, then the moral obligation to the wife might outweigh the obligation to the man's privacy, especially since he was deceptive. However, the author could be in the wrong for breaking the initial promise, even if the reason is valid. Alternatively, the author's intent is to prevent further harm to the wife, which is a moral act. \n\nI lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the intent is to right a wrong, even if it has side effects. So answer B.\n"
