I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author slept with someone they met at a wedding. The person is married, so that's cheating. The author didn't know this at the time, but after finding out, they're conflicted about exposing the cheater. The man is also in the closet about being gay, so outing him is a big deal. The author wants to tell the wife but doesn't want to out him. But how can they do that? If they tell the wife that her husband cheated, they might have to mention that he's having affairs with men, which would out him. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They might feel guilty because they had a relationship with someone who's unfaithful. They also care about the man's well-being, considering his family's reaction. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the author isn't in a position to force the man to come out. Outing someone is a serious breach, even if the intention is to protect the cheating partner.\n\nThe author's main mistake was having a relationship with a married man without knowing he was married. But once they found out, their dilemma is whether to protect the man's privacy or the wife's right to know. There's no clear right answer, but the initial action of sleeping with a married man is problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. The dilemma is between two unethical options. Since the author is trying to do the right thing but is caught between conflicting obligations, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The main issue is whether exposing the cheater is justified. If the author tells the wife, they might be outing the man, which is wrong unless justified. But the wife deserves to know. It's a tough call, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to inform the wife; however, the initial relationship might be a problem. But the question is about the current situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to balance ethical considerations without clear guidance.\n"
