I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man (the author) who had a relationship with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The author found out the man is cheating on his wife and is now considering exposing him to the wife, which would out him as gay. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had a sexual relationship with the married man, who was using Grindr. The man was married with kids, and the wife was out of the country during the wedding. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair. Now, the author feels guilty and wants to tell the wife but is conflicted about outing the man.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had consensual relationships, didn't know the man was married, and now wants to inform the wife. The dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know she's been cheated on.\n\nLegally, cheating is a private matter, and while it's morally wrong to cheat, the author isn't the one who initiated the cheating. The man is the one who violated his marriage, not the author. The author didn't know he was married, so there's no intent to deceive from the author. Also, the author was respecting the man's request to keep his sexuality private until he was ready.\n\nEthically, the author feels a duty to the wife, but outing someone without their consent can have serious consequences. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. But how to do that without outing him? That's tricky. The author is in a tough spot. If he tells the wife, he's outting the man, which the man was scared to do himself. If he doesn't, the wife remains in the dark.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author didn't know the man was married. The man misrepresented his marital status. The author didn't cheat on anyone; it was the man who cheated. So the wrong here is on the man, not the author. The author's actions were consensual and based on the information he had at the time.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating. However, the dilemma is between two wrongs. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was deceived, he's not at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
