I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a complex set of actions and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old man who had multiple sexual encounters with a male usher, a married man who is in the closet. The usher asked the author not to reveal his sexuality. However, the author later found out that the usher is married with kids and that the relationship is an affair. The author is conflicted about exposing the cheater because it would out him as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is considering informing the wife, which would involve outing him, and wants to know if they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author had consensual relationships with someone who was married, which is cheating. Then, they discover the husband is gay and have to decide whether to expose the cheating, which would out him. The author is trying to balance the wife's right to know about the infidelity against the usher's desire to stay closeted.\n\nThe key issues here are consent and deception. The author didn't know the usher was married when they started the relationship. The usher didn't disclose his marital status, which is a significant issue because having a relationship while married is adultery. However, the author also had a relationship knowing the usher was gay but not openly so. The author is now considering exposing the infidelity, which would out him.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions started when they had a sexual relationship with someone who was married without knowing the marital status. But once they found out, they were in a situation where they had to decide between the wife's rights and the usher's privacy. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but causing harm to the usher.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they expose the affair, they're not the one cheating, but they are facilitating the exposure of someone else's infidelity, which could be seen as helping the wife. However, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy, even if the person is cheating. So the author is in a tough spot between two wrongs: letting the wife be unaware of the infidelity or outing the husband's sexuality.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no clear right answer, but the author isn't the one who cheated. The husband is the one who committed adultery and is being deceptive about his sexuality. The author's actions might be seen as trying to correct a wrong, but the method (outing) is problematic. However, the author isn't the one in the wrong for the initial relationship, as they were deceived. The main issue is whether exposing the affair justifies outing him. Since the author is considering it to inform the wife, they might be trying to do the right thing, but the means are ethically murky. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would be B (No) because the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The husband is the one who cheated, and the author is trying to address the situation, albeit in a complicated way.\n"
