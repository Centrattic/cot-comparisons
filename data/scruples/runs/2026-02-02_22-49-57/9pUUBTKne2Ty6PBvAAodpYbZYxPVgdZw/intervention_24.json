I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating spouse, even if it means outing him as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They both knew he was gay but not ready to come out. Now, the author found out he's cheating on his wife and wants to tell her. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's desire to stay in the closet.\n\nSo, the question is about morality here. On one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person's family might not accept their sexuality. \n\nThe author is trying to navigate between two wrongs. If they tell the wife, they're outing him. If they stay silent, the wife is being cheated on. But is the author at fault for wanting to protect the wife's rights?\n\nI think the key points are consent and responsibility. The man cheated, which is his wrongdoing. The author was involved in the affair, so maybe they do have a role in it. But the author might feel responsible to inform the wife because they were part of the cheating. However, the author was also keeping the man's secret about being gay. \n\nBut the man didn't hide the fact that he was gay from the author; he was upfront about it. The author agreed not to out him. Now, the author is in a bind because revealing the cheating would require outing him. But the wife has a right to know, and the author might feel ethically obligated to tell her. \n\nIs there a way to inform the wife without outing him? Maybe. If the author can tell the wife about the infidelity without disclosing his sexuality, that would solve both problems. But if the author can't do that, then they have to choose between two harmful outcomes. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author isn't the one who cheated. The man is the one who committed infidelity. The author might be complicit, but they're trying to right a wrong by informing the wife. However, outing someone can have severe consequences, so the author might be causing harm by revealing his sexuality. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is trying to protect the wife's interests, maybe they're justified. However, they also broke the man's trust by planning to out him. It's a tough call. I think the author isn't in the wrong because the man's actions were the initial wrong. The author is trying to correct that, even if it means a difficult choice. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
