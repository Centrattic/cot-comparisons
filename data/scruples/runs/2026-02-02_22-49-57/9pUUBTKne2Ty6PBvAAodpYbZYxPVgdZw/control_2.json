I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The author didn't know he was married when they started sleeping together, and now they're conflicted about whether to tell his wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author is in a moral dilemma. They want to protect the man from being outed because his family might not accept it, but they also feel the wife has a right to know about the cheating. The key points here are consent, deception, and potential harm.\n\nThe man was dishonest from the start. He was married and in a closeted relationship, using the wedding as an opportunity to be with the author. The author didn't know about the marriage, so their initial involvement wasn't fully informed. However, the author continued the relationship even after the man revealed he's gay, which might suggest some level of trust or lack of deeper investigation on their part.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the cheating, which would out him. But is the author in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife? Well, the man's actions were a betrayal of his marriage. The author wasn't in a committed relationship themselves, but they had a series of hookups. The question is whether the author has a moral obligation to inform the wife. \n\nHowever, the author is also bound by the confidentiality they promised. They agreed not to out him, so revealing his infidelity might break that promise. But the wife's right to know her husband's infidelity is a strong argument. The author is in a tricky spot between two wrongs: outing someone against their wishes or letting a spouse be deceived.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author's own actions were not entirely innocent. They engaged in a relationship with someone they knew was in a committed relationship, even if they didn't know the full extent at first. Their continued involvement after the man's marriage was revealed (if they knew later) could be seen as complicity. However, the author didn't know initially, so maybe the fault isn't entirely on them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might be partially at fault for not checking more into the man's situation and for continuing the relationship. But the main issue is whether exposing him is their responsibility. The man's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's dilemma is about the consequences of their actions.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell the wife. If the author's intention is to prevent further harm to the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, outing someone without their consent can be harmful. But the man's cheating is also harmful. It's a balance of harms.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to act in the wife's interest, but they should consider the consequences. The answer is probably B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it's complicated. The initial relationship might not be entirely their fault if they were deceived, and their intention to inform the wife is about justice for her. So, maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
