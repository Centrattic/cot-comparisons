I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who had a sexual relationship with another man, knowing he's gay and in the closet. They met at a wedding, had multiple encounters, and later found out the man is married with kids. The author is now conflicted about exposing the cheating husband, which would out him as gay, possibly causing family issues. \n\nFirst, the author's actions: sleeping with someone they knew was in a committed marriage. That's cheating, so the author is complicit in the infidelity. The man was already married, so any relationship had consensual non-monogamy, but since the wife didn't consent, it's cheating on her. The author might feel remorse, but they still engaged in the affair. \n\nSecond, the moral dilemma: whether to tell the wife (out the husband as gay in the process) or not. The author is considering exposing the cheating, which is understandable as the wife has a right to know. However, outting someone against their wishes is a violation of their privacy. The husband was explicit about not wanting to come out yet. The author had agreed to keep it secret initially. \n\nBut the author is now considering breaking that promise because they feel guilt and the wife's right to know. The author's initial mistake was engaging in the affair knowing the man was married. The complicity in the infidelity complicates their position. However, the author's intent to inform the wife is about being honest, but it also involves outing him, which could have serious consequences for him and his family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They were part of the affair, which is unethical. But whether they're in the wrong for exposing the husband depends on the context. The act of cheating is wrong, but the author is now trying to correct it by informing the wife. However, exposing the husband's sexuality without his consent might be another wrong. \n\nThe key points: the author's initial actions were wrong (cheating). The current dilemma is about whether to expose the husband's infidelity, which is a separate issue. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they should consider the consequences of outing the husband. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) for the initial cheating, but the question is about being in the wrong in the current situation. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, after the fact, in the current dilemma. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him. The author's initial actions were wrong, but the question is about the current decision. The author's dilemma is about whether to do the right thing by the wife but at the cost of outing the husband. Since the author had promised not to out him, breaking that promise could be wrong. However, the wife's right to know is also a factor. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is not the one who committed the marriage violation; the husband did. The author is a participant. But the author is now trying to mitigate the harm. However, exposing the husband without his consent could be another violation. So, is the author in the wrong if they inform the wife? It's a tough call. Legally, the author isn't obligated to report it, but ethically, there's a conflict. \n\nIf the answer is based on whether the author is in the wrong for the current situation (the exposure), then the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to inform the wronged party (the wife). However, the author is also violating the husband's privacy. But the husband was already cheating, so perhaps the wife's right to know overrides the privacy. The author's initial mistake is a different matter. The question is about the current dilemma, not the past actions. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the act of exposing the cheater (which out the husband) is wrong. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they are in the wrong if they had promised not to out the husband. The husband asked them not to out him, so breaking that promise is a separate issue. However, the author might not have the authority to decide the wife's right to know. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the husband, because the wife's right to know about the infidelity is a higher priority. The author's initial actions were wrong, but the current dilemma is a different matter. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described, which includes both the affair and the potential exposure. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" The situation includes both the affair and the current dilemma. If the focus is on the current decision, then the answer is B. If the focus includes the affair, then A. The question is a bit ambiguous. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong in the situation, which includes both the affair and the dilemma. The answer likely considers the affair as part of the situation. Since the author is part of the cheating, they are in the wrong. However, the main question is about the current dilemma. \n\nThe user's original question is: \"Is the author in the wrong?\" given the whole scenario. The author is in the wrong for participating in the affair with a married man. The current dilemma about exposing him is a secondary issue. The main issue is the affair. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they were part of the infidelity.\n"
