I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a situation where they had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. They found out he's cheating and are conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife without outing him. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with someone who's married. That's a red flag. But the man was already cheating, so maybe the author is a third party here. The key issue is whether the author is morally wrong for considering exposing the cheating, even if it out the man as gay.\n\nThe man was in the closet, and the author initially promised not to out him. Now the author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and not wanting to out him. The question is if the author is in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing him.\n\nIf the author is the one who's the third party, they might feel guilty for being part of the infidelity. But the main ethical dilemma is about the wife's right to know versus the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife, especially if the man is already cheating. However, outing someone without their consent is a serious matter. But in this case, the infidelity is a separate issue. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to inform the wife, but ethically, there's an argument that the wife should know. However, outing the man might not be necessary to inform the wife. The author could potentially tell the wife without revealing the man's sexuality, but the scenario suggests that the cheating is linked to his being gay, so maybe it's hard to separate the two. If outing is a necessary consequence, the author has to weigh the wife's right to know against the potential harm to the man's family and his personal choice to stay closeted. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but they also have a responsibility to consider the man's wishes. However, since the man is already cheating, his actions have consequences. The author's moral dilemma is valid, but whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between the two conflicting obligations. Since the author is trying to do the right thing and isn't malicious, the answer might lean towards not in the wrong. But the act of cheating themselves is a factor. However, the user's question is specifically about the act of exposing the cheater, not the initial cheating with the author. So if the author is a third party who is now trying to notify the wife, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
