I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who had a sexual relationship with a married man who's also in the closet. The author is considering exposing the cheating but is conflicted because it would out the man as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had sex with the man after a wedding party, and they continued the relationship multiple times. The man was married and a father, but he's gay and not out. The author now wants to tell the wife about the infidelity but is worried about outing him. They're considering if that's the right thing to do, even if it means outing him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to inform the wife. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a consensual relationship with the man, but it was an affair. The man was deceptive, hiding both his marriage and his sexuality. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. Exposing the cheating could be justified as helping the wife, even if it leads to outing him. However, the author also made a promise of confidentiality regarding his sexuality, which is a big deal. Outing someone can have serious consequences, especially if the man's family is not accepting.\n\nBut there's a conflict here. The author is considering a conflict between honoring their promise of privacy and informing the wronged spouse. The man's actions are unethical and harmful to his family. The author might feel a duty to the wife, but at the expense of the man's privacy.\n\nIs the author responsible for the man's deceit? The man lied about his relationship status and sexuality. The author was complicit in an affair, which isn't ethical, but the man initiated the deception. The author is now trying to make amends by informing the wife, even if it causes collateral damage.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to do so? The author could argue that they have a duty to the wife, but others might say that the author shouldn't be the one to expose the man's affair, as they were part of the problem. However, the author is also trying to prevent further harm.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no obligation to report the affair. Ethically, it's a gray area. If the author is in a position where they can help the wife, maybe they have a moral duty. But if they're not the one who has the closest relationship with the wife, maybe they shouldn't. Also, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a serious matter, regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they decide to tell the wife, they might be doing a difficult but just thing, even if it means outing him. However, they could also be seen as violating his trust. But the man was already unfaithful, which is a betrayal. The author's actions might be seen as a necessary evil to prevent further harm to the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was part of the infidelity. They contributed to the problem, so maybe they shouldn't be the one to fix it. But that's a bit of a stretch. People can make mistakes and then try to correct them.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a very difficult situation, but if they decide to inform the wife, they might be acting in a morally right way, even if it causes unintended consequences. The man's actions were wrong, so exposing the affair could be justified. However, the act of outing him as gay is a separate issue. The author might need to find a way to inform the wife without outing him, but if that's not possible, there's a moral justification for doing so. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to correct a wrong done by the man, even if it's a tough decision.\n"
