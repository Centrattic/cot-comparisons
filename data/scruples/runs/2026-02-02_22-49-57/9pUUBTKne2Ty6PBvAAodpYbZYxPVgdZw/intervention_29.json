I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who's in the closet about being gay. The man cheated, and the author is now conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife or not.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral aspects here. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, so maybe that's part of it. But the key point is whether the author is obligated to tell the wife, even if it means outing the man. \n\nOn one hand, the author is considering exposing a cheater, which is a violation of trust in the marriage. The wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. On the other hand, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is generally seen as a violation of their privacy, especially if they're not ready to come out. The man is in the closet, and his family might not accept it, leading to potential harm.\n\nThe author is trying to balance these two issues. The moral dilemma here is between honesty and privacy. If the author tells the wife, they're telling the truth but outing the man. If they don't, they're letting the wife be unaware of the infidelity but protecting his privacy.\n\nSome might argue the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, while others might say they should respect the man's privacy. The question is whether the author is obligated to act. The answer depends on the ethical framework one uses. Utilitarianism might look at the consequences: which action causes less harm? If the wife is being cheated on, that's harm, but outing the man could also cause significant personal and familial harm.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, but the method is tricky. Maybe they could find a way to tell the wife without outing the man. However, since the affair is with someone the wife likely knows (the wedding usher), it might be hard to do that. The author's intention is to protect both parties, but the situation is complex.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the author is justified in exposing the cheater despite the potential out. Given that the author didn't know he was married and the man's closeted status, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, but there's a risk of causing harm to the man. However, the author's intent is to do the right thing, so it's a tough call. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're acting on the belief that the wife deserves to know, even though the method is complicated.\n"
