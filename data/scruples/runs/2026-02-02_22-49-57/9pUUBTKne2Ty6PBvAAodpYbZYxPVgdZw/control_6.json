I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, even if it out him. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The man was not open about his sexuality and asked the author to keep it secret. Now, the author is conflicted because they want to inform the wife about the cheating but don't want to out him to his family, who might not be accepting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had consensual relationships with someone who was married and in the closet. The author initially agreed to keep the affair secret. Now, they're considering breaking that agreement to inform the wife, which would out the man. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions started with agreeing to secrecy, then moving on to having multiple affairs. The man is cheating on his wife and hiding his sexuality. The author now wants to expose him, which is a complex situation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel guilty for cheating themselves, but the main issue here is whether they have an obligation to the wife. If the author is right about the wife's right to know, then there's an argument for informing her. However, outing someone against their wishes can be seen as a violation of trust, even if the reason is to inform a wronged spouse.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's own role in the affair. They knew the man was married and had a relationship with him, which is cheating. The author's initial agreement to secrecy complicates things. If they now want to expose him, they should consider the consequences, like the impact on his family and his potential well-being.\n\nThe dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author is in a tricky position because they are not directly involved with the wife, so their obligation might not be clear. However, since the author is part of the reason the affair happened (by engaging in it), there's a question of responsibility here.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intention to inform the wife justifies breaching the man's confidentiality. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing him, that might be better. But if the only way is to out him, then the author is creating another ethical problem.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting someone's autonomy and privacy is important unless there's a direct threat to others. Since the wife is directly affected by the cheating, there's a case for informing her. However, the method of doing so without outing him is crucial. If that's not possible, the author's action could be seen as a violation of the man's privacy, even if the intent is good.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's situation is complex. They have a responsibility to the wife but also to the man's wishes. The initial agreement to secrecy and the ongoing affair might mean the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship with a married man. However, the desire to inform the wife isn't inherently wrong, but the method and consequences matter. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if they act with the wife's best interest in mind, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
