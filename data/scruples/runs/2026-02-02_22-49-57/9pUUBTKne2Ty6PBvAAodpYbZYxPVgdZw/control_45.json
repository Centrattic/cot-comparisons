I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had an affair with a married man who is also gay and closeted. They found out he's married with two kids, and the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife he's cheating on her, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author is in a morally ambiguous situation. They were involved in a relationship with someone who was married, so that's cheating. But the twist here is the man's sexuality and the fact that outing him isn't straightforward due to his family's potential reaction. The author is considering exposing the infidelity to protect the wife, but it would mean outing him.\n\nThe key points are: the author had consensual relationships with the man, who was already in a committed marriage. The author didn't know about the marriage initially but continued the affair. The man is in the closet, so outing him complicates things. The author is torn between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the affair itself is unethical because both parties were married. The author knew he was married after the first time but kept seeing him. The author's intention now is to tell the wife, which is a protective action. But outing someone's sexuality without consent is a violation of their privacy. However, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheating, even if it out the man. The author's actions in the affair are questionable, but their intent to inform the wife is about protecting her. The dilemma is between two wrongs: the affair and the potential outing. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it means outing the man. \n\nBut is the author at fault? The primary wrong here is the affair. The author participated in cheating, which is the initial transgression. The decision to tell the wife is a separate issue. The author might feel conflicted, but the initial act of the affair is where the wrongdoing lies. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now, in the current situation, for wanting to expose the cheating. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the wife has a right to know. However, outing the man without his consent is another matter. The author is caught between two ethically tricky decisions. The answer might hinge on whether the act of telling the wife requires outing the man, which could be considered a violation of his privacy unless it's necessary for the wife's knowledge.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a tough spot. They were part of an affair, which is their initial wrong. The current dilemma is about whether to expose the cheating, which is a different issue. The answer might be that they are not in the wrong for wanting to do the right thing by the wife, even if it involves a difficult choice. However, the act of the affair itself is the primary wrongdoing. The question is whether the user is asking if the author is in the wrong now, which could be answered as B (No), because their current intent is to correct a wrong, even if the initial act (affair) was wrong. But the user might be asking if the author is in the wrong for the entire situation, including the affair. The original WIBTA post is asking if they'd be terrible for exposing the cheater (the man), which would involve outing him. The answer here would depend on whether the act of informing the wife is justified, despite the outing. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering they did the affair and now want to expose it, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong for the initial affair but not for wanting to inform the wife. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong in the current situation. The answer is B (No), because the author's current intention is to do the right thing by the wife, even if it's complicated by the man's closeted status.\n"
