I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong when considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The author had an affair with a married man who is in the closet. They were friends for a while, and the man is married with two kids. Now, the author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and not outing the man.\n\nFirst, the author is in a morally complex situation. They were having an affair themselves, which complicates their ethical standing. But the key issue is whether they have a duty to inform the wife about the cheating, even if it means outing the husband.\n\nThe man is cheating, which is wrong, but he's also being deceptive by staying in the closet. The author was promised confidentiality when the affair started, but after finding out about the marriage, the situation changed. The author's dilemma is between loyalty to the wife (as the wronged party) and protecting the husband's privacy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the wife has a right to know if her husband is cheating. Ethically, some might argue that the author shouldn't interfere in someone else's marriage unless they're directly involved. However, since the author is the one who had the affair, they might feel responsible for informing the wife.\n\nBut there's also the issue of outing someone without their consent. Even if the husband is cheating, revealing his sexuality without his permission could be harmful. The author is trying to balance these two things.\n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it might be because they were complicit in the affair and now want to shift the blame onto the husband. Alternatively, if they're not in the wrong, they're trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, even though it's a tough choice.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions are justified. Since the husband is cheating and the wife deserves to know, but outing him is a separate issue. The author might not be in the wrong if they choose to inform the wife discreetly without outing him, but if they proceed, it's a tough call. However, given the context, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to do the right thing for the wife, even if it has consequences.\n"
