I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about someone who had an affair with a married man who's also in the closet about being gay. Now they're conflicted about whether to expose him to his wife, which would out him to his family and possibly cause issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the man had a sexual relationship, which was a secret because he's gay and not out. The man is married, and the author found out he's cheating on his wife. The author is now considering telling the wife, which would out him. The moral dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the potential harm of outing him, especially considering his family's possible reaction.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the man is cheating, which is a betrayal of his wife and family. The wife has a right to know, as cheating is a serious matter that affects her directly. The author might feel a duty to inform her to prevent further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, outing someone without their consent can violate their privacy and potentially cause significant personal and family distress. Especially if the man's parents are not accepting of his being gay, this could lead to conflict. The author also had a consensual relationship with the man, so while they might feel guilty, they weren't forced into it. However, the fact that the man was married complicates things because he was already in a deceptive relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own actions. They had a relationship knowing (after the fact) that the man was married, which is cheating. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, not necessarily for the affair itself. The author might feel justified in wanting to inform the wife, but there's a conflict with the man's privacy and wishes regarding his sexuality.\n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author can inform the wife without outing him. The user mentions that the man is the only son, and his parents might not react well. So if the author tells the wife, it's likely that the man's sexuality would come out, especially if the wife confronts him. The author might be worried about causing family issues, but the wife's rights to know are also important.\n\nIn terms of morality, there's no clear right or wrong. However, the author is in a difficult position. If they don't tell the wife, the man continues to cheat, but if they do tell, they might be outing him, which he explicitly asked not to do. The author's intention is to right a wrong (cheating) but at the expense of another (outing). This creates a conflict of moral obligations.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't illegal, but the ethical aspect is more about the personal responsibility. The author could argue that the wife deserves to know, but they could also be seen as violating the man's privacy. The fact that the author had a relationship with him might mean they have a responsibility to act, but they also might be considered a third party who isn't the wife's confidant.\n\nIn the end, the decision hinges on which moral duty takes precedence: the wife's right to know about the infidelity or the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. Since the man was already in a deceptive relationship, some might argue that the author has a duty to inform the wife. However, the method of informing the wife could be done without explicitly outing him if possible, but the user says that might not be feasible given the circumstances.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the act of informing the wife inherently out the man. If it does, then the author is causing harm to the man in order to help the wife. If not, then they're helping the wife without causing additional harm. But given the scenario, it seems that outing is inevitable, so the author is caught between two wrongs.\n"
