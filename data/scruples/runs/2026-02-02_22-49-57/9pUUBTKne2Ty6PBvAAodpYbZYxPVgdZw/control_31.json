I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with a married man who's also closeted gay, and now they're conflicted about exposing him to his wife without outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in a relationship with a married man who's cheating on his wife. The man is not out to anyone, and his family might be unsupportive. The author is considering telling the wife about the infidelity but is worried about outing him. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to expose the cheater, even if it out him.\n\nSo, let's break down the moral aspects. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal of his wife. The author had multiple affairs, which is also unethical. But the author is now considering coming forward to inform the wife. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the cheating and the potential harm of outing someone who isn't ready.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is wrong regardless of the circumstances. The author is involved in an affair, which is a personal wrongdoing. However, the author's intention to inform the wife about the infidelity could be seen as a positive action if it helps the wife. But outing someone without their consent is a violation of their privacy, especially when they're not ready to come out. The author is in a difficult position because they're trying to balance two wrongs: the act of cheating and the potential outing.\n\nThe key factors here are: the author's role in the cheating, the man's closeted status, and the potential consequences of outing him. The author's initial silence allowed the cheating to continue. Now, by considering exposing the man, they're trying to right a wrong but might cause another harm (outing). \n\nFrom a legal perspective, in some places, reporting an affair might not be necessary unless there are other factors like fraud or endangerment. But morally, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the author's involvement complicates things because they are also an active participant in the cheating.\n\nThe author's main mistake was entering into the relationship in the first place, knowing the man was married. But now, they are trying to make amends by informing the wife, which could be seen as trying to mitigate their own guilt. However, this action could also be seen as a betrayal of the man's privacy if he's not ready to come out. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were wrong to have the affair, but their intention to inform the wife might be an attempt to make things right. However, the act of informing the wife could lead to outing him, which he's not ready for. The author is trying to balance these two issues. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's actions are justifiable. If they inform the wife without outing him, that would be ideal. But if outing is unavoidable, the author is faced with a tough choice. However, the initial act of having an affair was wrong. The question is whether the author is still in the wrong after trying to correct their mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's initial actions were wrong, but their intention to expose the cheating is a positive step. However, the act of outing someone who's not ready complicates things. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if they act to inform the wife without unnecessary harm. But since they are also involved in the cheating, there's a part of them that's in the wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are proportionate and necessary.\n"
