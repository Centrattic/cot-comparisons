I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had a one-night stand with someone at a wedding, found out he's married and has kids, and he's gay but in the closet. Now they're conflicted between protecting his privacy and informing his wife about the cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong to potentially out him by telling his wife. The user wants to know if their action would be considered wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe author was in a consensual relationship with the man, but only later found out he's married. They had multiple encounters after the initial one. The man asked them not to reveal his sexuality. The author is now trying to decide if they should tell the wife about the infidelity, even if it means outing him. \n\nEthically, there's a balance between a person's right to privacy and the wife's right to know about the betrayal. Cheating is a serious matter, and the wife might have a right to be informed. But outing someone against their wishes, even for a good reason, can cause significant harm. The man might not be ready to come out, and his family could be unsupportive. \n\nThe author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife, but it's at the expense of the man's privacy. The question is whether the author's action is justified. \n\nSome might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they were deceived and the wife deserves to know. Others might say the author's role is not to act as a judge, and outing someone is a violation of trust. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the key here is the author's responsibility. Since the author was in a consensual relationship, they might have a duty to inform the wife. However, doing so could lead to outing him, which he specifically asked not to happen. \n\nThe dilemma is between two wrongs: keeping the secret and letting the wife remain unaware of the cheating, or telling the truth about the cheating but outing his sexuality. Legally, cheating isn't a crime, so the wife's response is uncertain. But ethically, the author's position is complex. \n\nIf they tell the wife, they're fulfilling a moral obligation to the spouse, but breaking the other person's trust. If they don't tell, they're protecting the man's privacy but leaving the wife in the dark. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. In some views, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it involves outing. In others, the act of outing is inherently wrong regardless of the context. \n\nBut given the scenario, the author's actions stem from a desire to do the right thing by the wife, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the method is questionable. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for getting involved knowing the man's situation, but the original question is about exposing the cheater. \n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater by outing him. So, answer A or B. The options are yes (A) or no (B). \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to act in the wife's interest, even though it's a tough situation. But others might say A (Yes) because they're breaching confidentiality. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering the exposure. \n\nThe moral dilemma is real, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to do what's right for the wife. It's a tough call, but the answer is B.\n"
