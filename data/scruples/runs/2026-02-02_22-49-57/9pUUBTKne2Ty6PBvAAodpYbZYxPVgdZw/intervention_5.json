I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married and in the closet. The person cheated, and the author now wants to tell the wife. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the potential harm of outing someone who isn't ready.\n\nThe key points here are consent and harm. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the affair. The man was dishonest about his relationship status. The author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even though it might out him. \n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting the wife from being cheated on. On the other, outing someone without their consent could be harmful. However, since the affair is a betrayal, the author might have a moral obligation to the wife. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they tell the truth to the wife without outing the man, maybe there's a way to do it. But if outing is unavoidable, the author might still be justified because the wife's rights as a spouse are significant. The author's actions are driven by the desire to prevent further harm, which could outweigh the man's desire for privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B \u2014 the author isn't in the wrong. They're caught in a tough situation, but their intent is to do the right thing for the wife, even if it has collateral consequences.\n"
