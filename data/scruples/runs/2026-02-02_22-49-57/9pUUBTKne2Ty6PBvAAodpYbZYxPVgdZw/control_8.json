I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they would be in the wrong for exposing a cheater, even if that means outing him. The situation is complicated because the person they slept with is married, has kids, and is in the closet about being gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married. That's cheating, so there's some guilt there. They knew he was gay and wanted to stay in the closet, so they agreed not to out him. But when they found out he was married, it changed things. They feel obligated to tell the wife about the infidelity but don't want to out him. \n\nThe moral dilemma is about balancing the rights of the wife to know she's been cheated on versus the privacy and potential consequences for the husband. The author is conflicted between these two sides. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are: the author had consensual sex with someone who was married, which is cheating. But the author didn't know about the marriage when they started the relationship. The husband (ushers) is the one who is cheating, lying to both his wife and the author. \n\nThe author is now considering exposing the husband's infidelity, which would out him as gay. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are protecting her from the cheating spouse. On the other hand, outing the husband against his wishes could cause family issues. But the husband is the one who is unfaithful and in the closet. The author isn't directly responsible for the husband's decisions, but they are involved in the situation. \n\nThe author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair, so they might not be entirely at fault. However, they continued the relationship after knowing about the marriage, which could be seen as complicit in the cheating. \n\nBut the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. Since the husband is the one cheating, the author's intention is to inform the wronged party (the wife). Even though it out the husband, the author's action is to protect the wife from further harm. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to do the right thing by the wife while navigating a difficult situation. The author's main mistake was the initial affair, but their current dilemma is about righting a wrong, not being in the wrong themselves.\n"
