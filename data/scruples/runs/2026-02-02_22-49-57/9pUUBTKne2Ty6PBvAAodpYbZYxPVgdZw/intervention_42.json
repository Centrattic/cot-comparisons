I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're wrong for wanting to expose a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The situation is that they had multiple affairs with a married man who's in the closet. He's married with kids, and his parents aren't accepting of his sexuality. The person is conflicted between telling the wife about the cheating and outing him versus keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had consensual relationships without knowing he was married. They found out he's cheating, which is a betrayal. The author is now considering informing the wife, which would out him. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to do that.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but ethically, it's a breach of trust. The author might feel a duty to the wife to inform her, as she's being cheated on. However, outing someone's sexual orientation without consent can be harmful, especially if the person is in the closet. The author is concerned about the man's well-being and his family's reaction. \n\nBut the author is not the one who cheated; they were deceived. The man is the one in the wrong here for cheating. The author's dilemma is whether they have a moral obligation to the wife. However, the act of outing someone can have serious consequences, so it's a sensitive decision. \n\nIf the author chooses to tell the wife, they might be acting in the wife's interest, but it also out the man. If they don't, the wife remains unaware but the author might feel complicit. However, the author isn't responsible for the man's decision to cheat or his being in the closet. \n\nThe key points: The author had consensual relations without knowing the man was married. They discovered the infidelity and are now considering informing the wife. The act of telling the wife would out him. The author's intention is to do the right thing, even though it's complicated. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to address the cheating, which is a wrong done by the man. However, there's a moral complexity here. The answer hinges on whether the author has a duty to the wife without being a legal or moral authority. Since the author is not the cheater, their action is a moral choice, not a wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
