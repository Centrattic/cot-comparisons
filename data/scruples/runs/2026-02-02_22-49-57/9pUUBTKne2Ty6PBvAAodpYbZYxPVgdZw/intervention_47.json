I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and gay, and now they're facing a dilemma about whether to tell the wife. The key points here are the ethics of exposing someone's infidelity versus outing them.\n\nThe author had consensual encounters with the man, who was in a closeted relationship. The man is cheating on his wife, which is a betrayal. The author feels conflicted because they respect his privacy (not wanting to out him) but also think the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between two rights: the right of the wife to know about the betrayal and the right of the man to keep his sexual orientation private. However, in most ethical frameworks, the harm caused by infidelity (which is a direct betrayal of trust) is often considered more severe than the act of coming out, especially if the latter is done responsibly. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author can't inform the wife without outing the husband. If outing him is necessary to inform the wife, then the author faces a dilemma. The question is whether the author has an obligation to the wife here. \n\nIn some views, the author isn't directly responsible for the husband's actions. They didn't force him to cheat; they were part of his actions. However, if the author knew he was cheating and continued the relationship, they might have a moral obligation to the wife. But this is complicated because the author isn't in a position to police others' relationships unless there's a direct responsibility (like being a spouse). \n\nThe author's main mistake might be in engaging in the affair in the first place, but that's a different issue. Now, regarding exposing the cheater: if the author tells the wife, it's an act of informing a spouse about infidelity, which is often seen as justified. However, the method of doing so would involve outing him, which could have negative consequences for him and his family. \n\nBut considering the husband is already in a harmful situation (cheating on his wife, closeted, possibly fearing family rejection), the author's intention is to right a wrong. The harm caused by the cheating might outweigh the harm of outing him. However, the author could be in the wrong if they proceed recklessly without considering the consequences. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't obligated to involve themselves. They could choose to stay out of it, as they aren't directly responsible for the husband's actions. But if they feel a moral duty, they might have to weigh the two harms. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the complexity, but focusing on the act of informing the wife about the cheating, which is a breach of confidentiality but also a matter of justice, I think the answer leans towards B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the husband, because the cheater's actions are a greater violation of trust. However, the method should consider the husband's privacy and potential consequences. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, the answer is B.\n"
