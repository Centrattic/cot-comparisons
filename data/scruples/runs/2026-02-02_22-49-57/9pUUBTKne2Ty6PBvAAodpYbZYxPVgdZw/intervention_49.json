I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given post is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand with a married man who is in the closet. The man asked them to keep it secret because he's not ready to come out. The author initially agreed but is now conflicted because they found out he's married and has kids, and they feel guilty about cheating on his wife. They want to tell the wife but don't want to out him to his family, which might not accept it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling the wife, even though it out the man. On one hand, the author had an affair, which is unethical. But the man is already cheating by being in a closeted relationship and using Grindr, which could imply he's not in a monogamous marriage. The author is now trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, which is a moral dilemma.\n\nBut wait, is the author's action of telling the wife a separate issue? The original question is about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. If the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, outing someone without their consent could be problematic, even if the intention is to stop the cheating.\n\nBut the man is the one who's been unfaithful. The wife has a right to know, but the author is not in a position to decide when and how that happens. Also, the author's own actions contributed to the situation. They might feel guilty and want to make amends, but that doesn't necessarily justify outing him. There's a conflict between the author's responsibility to the wife and respecting the man's privacy about his sexuality.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that the author should not interfere in someone else's marriage, especially when it involves outing them. The answer depends on the balance between the duty to inform the spouse and the right to privacy. Since the man is the one violating his marriage, the author might have a moral obligation to the wife. However, outing him could be seen as overstepping, even if it's to stop the cheating. There might be legal implications too, but the question is about moral wrong.\n\nSo considering all, the author's intention is to correct a wrong done by the man, but their method of doing so could be problematic. However, the man's actions are the primary issue here. The author is in a tough spot, but maybe not in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even if it out him. But the answer might be more nuanced. Alternatively, the author could be in the wrong because they shouldn't have been in the relationship to begin with and now are causing further harm by outing him, which could lead to other issues beyond the cheating. It's a tricky case where both actions have consequences. The user's view is that the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. Since the moral dilemma is about whether to out the cheater, the key point is the author's responsibility. If the author is the one who was deceived and wants to inform the wife, maybe they are not in the wrong, but there's no right answer here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater if it means outing him. Given that the man is the cheater, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even though it's a tough choice. So the answer is B.\n"
