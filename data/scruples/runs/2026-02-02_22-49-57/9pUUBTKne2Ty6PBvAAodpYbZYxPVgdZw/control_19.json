I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old man who is married and the father of two. The married man is gay and closeted. The author found out about the marriage and kids later, and now he's conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the affair, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with someone who is married. That's cheating, so from the wife's perspective, she's been cheated on. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, but after finding out, continued the relationship. That raises a question about his responsibility.\n\nThe married man is in a committed marriage but also in a secret relationship. He's in a morally ambiguous position. The author is now considering exposing the cheating, which would out him as gay, which could have serious consequences for his family. The author is torn between the wife's right to know and the married man's privacy and safety regarding his sexuality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's caught in a tricky situation where he's not the one who committed the infidelity. But by continuing the relationship after knowing he's married, maybe he's complicit. However, he's also considering exposing the cheating as a way to do the right thing for the wife. The dilemma is whether the wife's right to know outweighs the potential harm of outing the man.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't the one who committed the betrayal. The married man is the one who cheated. The author is now trying to address the situation, even though he's part of it. If he tells the wife, it could help her take action, but it would reveal his partner's sexuality against his wishes. However, the married man's actions have multiple layers of dishonesty.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he decides to tell the wife, he's taking a stand for the wronged spouse. However, if he stays silent, he's allowing the cheating to continue. The question is about the author's actions, not the married man's. The author's dilemma is real, but is he in the wrong for considering telling the truth, even if it out someone?\n\nI think the key point is that the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's a difficult choice. He's not the one who committed the infidelity. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's caught in a situation where he's making a moral choice between two hard options, and the cheating was done by someone else.\n"
