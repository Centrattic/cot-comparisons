I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man (the author) who had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and in the closet. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the subsequent decision to expose the cheater.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship without knowing the man was married. So, did the man deceive the author? He didn't tell the author he was married, which is a form of dishonesty. The author also didn't know about the kids, so the deception might be on the man's part here. The author found out and now is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him as gay. The author is conflicted between not wanting to out him and feeling the wife has a right to know.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the man was the one in a committed relationship and lied about his status, he's the cheater. The author, on the other hand, was involved without knowing the full truth. The author's actions were based on the man's lies. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they were misled. But there's also the consideration of privacy versus the wife's right to know. However, the author is now deciding to expose the man by informing the wife, which is a separate action. But the initial act of sleeping with someone who was married and in the closet is about the man's deception. The author's dilemma is about whether to report the cheating, which could lead to outing. The author's own actions might be seen as wrong if they knowingly continued the relationship after finding out he was married. But the question is about being in the wrong in the situation as a whole. \n\nSo, if the man was the one who cheated by lying, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not knowing initially. The problem is the man's actions. The author's moral conflict comes from wanting to inform the wife while respecting his privacy. However, the act of exposing a cheater by revealing the infidelity (even if it out him) could be seen as justified because the wife has a right to know. But the author is the one who is considering this action. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nIf we consider the author's actions, they were initially involved without knowing the partner was married. Once they found out, they confronted him and now want to inform the wife. The wrong here is more on the man who cheated by lying. The author's decision to expose him could be seen as a moral choice to protect the wife. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out him. The answer would be B, No. But wait, maybe the author is in the wrong for the relationship itself. If the author had consensual sex with someone they knew was a married man, but they didn't know about the marriage, then the initial part is okay. But once they found out, continuing the relationship might be problematic. However, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for exposing him. The main issue is the act of exposure, not the initial relationship. \n\nBut the exposure is to the wife, which is the right thing to do if the wife is being cheated on. The author's own participation in the affair is a separate issue. The user might be implying that the author is wrong because they had the affair as well. But the question is about the act of exposing the cheater. So, the author isn't in the wrong for that. They are caught in a moral dilemma between the husband's privacy and the wife's right. The answer is B, No.\n"
