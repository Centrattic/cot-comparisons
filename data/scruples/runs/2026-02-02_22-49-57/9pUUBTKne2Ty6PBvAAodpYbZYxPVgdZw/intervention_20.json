I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is a man who had an affair with someone he met at his best friend's sister's wedding. He's married with two kids, and the author found out he's cheating. The author is now torn between exposing him to his wife (which would out him as gay) or keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with him, not knowing he was married. He was in the closet, so he asked her not to tell anyone. Now, the author feels responsible to tell his wife but doesn't want to out him. The user's friend's family might not accept him being gay. The author is conflicted because she cares about him but also thinks the wife has a right to know.\n\nThe key points here are the ethics of exposing someone to protect a spouse versus respecting the person's privacy. Legally, cheating is a personal matter, but if it's part of a pattern (like using Grindr), maybe the wife should know. However, outing someone against their will can have serious consequences, especially with family. The author might be considering the wife's right to know versus the husband's right to privacy.\n\nIn terms of morality, different people have different views. Some might say the author has an obligation to the wife because she's the wronged party. Others might argue that the author isn't responsible for the husband's choices and shouldn't meddle. The author might also be worried about the family's reaction if the husband is outed. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is between two wrongs: outing the husband (which could lead to family issues) or letting the wife be deceived. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. If the author decides to tell the wife, even if it out him, does that make the author wrong? Or is the author just trying to do the right thing by the wife?\n\nI think the answer depends on the context. If the author is acting out of a sense of duty to the wife and not for revenge, maybe it's justified. But there's also the risk of causing harm by outing someone. However, the husband's actions are harmful to his wife as well. It's a tough call. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling conflicted, but the act itself could be seen as necessary. So the answer might be B, but there's nuance here.\n"
