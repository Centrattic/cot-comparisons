I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is conflicted between exposing the cheating to the wife and not outing him, which could cause family issues.\n\nFirst, the author had multiple affairs with someone who's married. That's a problem because it's cheating, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the man was being dishonest about his sexuality and relationship status, the author chose to continue the relationship after finding out he was married. So, the author isn't innocent here. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author had an affair, lied to friends and family by keeping it secret, and is now considering exposing the man to his wife. The author's actions led to the situation where someone else is being cheated on. The moral dilemma here is about whether the author has a responsibility to inform the wife. However, the author's own actions (cheating) are the root issue. \n\nThe man is in the wrong for being unfaithful and hiding his sexuality, but the author also made choices that contributed to the problem. The author's dilemma about outing him is a result of their own actions. So, the author is at least partially at fault for participating in the affair and not speaking up earlier. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
