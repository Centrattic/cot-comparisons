I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The author had an affair with a married, closeted gay man. The man is cheating on his wife and has kids. The author found out and is conflicted between not outing him and informing the wife.\n\nFirst, the author is grappling with a moral dilemma. On one side, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a big deal, especially if the person is in the closet. On the other side, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author is trying to balance these two things.\n\nThe key points here are consent and harm. The author didn't out the man initially, respecting his privacy. However, after discovering the cheating, they're considering revealing the truth to the wife. The question is whether that's justified. \n\nCheating is a breach of trust in a marriage. The wife deserves to know if her spouse is unfaithful. But the method of informing her would involve outing him, which could cause additional harm to him, especially if his family isn't accepting. The author is trying to find a way to inform the wife without outing him, which is a valid concern.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Well, they're not the one who cheated; the man did. The author's intention is to right a wrong by informing the wife. However, the means involve outing him, which complicates things. But if there's a way to inform the wife without outing him (like through evidence of infidelity without revealing his sexuality), that might be a better approach. \n\nThe author's actions are driven by a desire to protect the wife's rights and prevent further harm. While outing someone without their consent is generally wrong, in this case, it's a necessary consequence to address the cheating. The author isn't the one who broke the vows; the husband did. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking to inform the wife, even if it means outing him. They're trying to act ethically despite the difficult situation. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
