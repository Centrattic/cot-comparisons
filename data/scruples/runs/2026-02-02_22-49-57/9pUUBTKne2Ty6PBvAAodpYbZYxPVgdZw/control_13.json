I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 20-year-old guy, had a sexual relationship with another man who is married with kids. The other guy is gay but in the closet, and the author promised not to tell anyone. Now the author found out that this guy is married, so he's cheating on his wife. The author is conflicted between exposing the cheater (which would out the man as gay) and keeping the secret to protect him from family issues.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship where he had multiple encounters with someone who's married. That already seems like cheating, right? So the author was involved in an affair. The guy is married, so the author is part of the infidelity. That's a problem because both parties are engaging in a relationship that's not consensual with the spouse.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the cheater to the wife. But in doing so, he would out the man as gay, which the man hasn't come out to his family. The author is trying to decide if it's right to tell the wife (which would out him) or keep it secret to avoid family issues. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the start, the author had a consensual relationship with a married person. Both the author and the married man are at fault here for cheating. The author's dilemma is about whether to report the cheating, which would out the man. But the author's own actions are part of the problem. \n\nThe author might think he's helping by informing the wife, but that's complicating the issue. The man is already in a wrong by cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author's decision to expose him could be seen as a way to take responsibility, but it's also violating the man's privacy. However, the author is also part of the infidelity, which is a breach of ethics. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair. The main issue is his own actions, but the question is about whether he is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. Since he was involved in the cheating, he's partially responsible. The dilemma about exposing the cheater is a secondary issue, but the initial act of having an affair is the primary wrongdoing.\n"
