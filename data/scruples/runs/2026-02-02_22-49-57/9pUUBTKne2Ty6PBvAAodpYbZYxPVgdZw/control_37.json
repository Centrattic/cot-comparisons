I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation involves the author, who had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences.\n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with a married man without knowing he was married. That's cheating, so the author is complicit in the infidelity. The man is cheating on his wife, but the author also didn't know he was married when they started. But still, the author's role in the affair is problematic.\n\nNow, the author wants to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out the man as gay. The dilemma is whether exposing the cheating (which is a betrayal) justifies outing him. The author is in a tough spot here. On one hand, the wife has the right to know about the infidelity. On the other, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a serious violation, especially if the person is in the closet and their family might react poorly.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions led to a situation where they might have to choose between protecting someone's privacy and preventing another person from being cheated on. The author's initial mistake was getting involved in a relationship with a married man, not knowing his marital status. That's a red flag. The author is now trying to make amends by informing the wife, which is a good intention, but the means (outing someone) is ethically tricky.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering this? Well, the author is not the one who cheated; the man did. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but the method involves outing someone, which is a major privacy issue. However, the author isn't legally obligated to keep this information to themselves. The question is about moral wrongness. If the author tells the wife, they could be helping her realize her husband's infidelity. But outing someone without their consent is a big deal. There's also the possibility of other people involved, as the man has a Grindr account, so the author might not be the only one.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intentions outweigh the violation of the man's privacy. The author isn't the cheater, but they were involved in a relationship that contributed to the cheating. The author's dilemma is between two ethical issues: infidelity and outing someone. The author's primary wrong is perhaps being part of the affair, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater by outing him. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering the options, the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife, which is a noble intent. However, the method of outing might not be the right approach. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to tell the truth, but the act of outing could be considered wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall. Since the author is trying to do the right thing for the wife, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the act of outing is ethically complex. The initial relationship might be a mistake, but the author's intention to inform the wife is a separate issue. The answer could be B because the author is trying to correct a wrong (cheating) even if it has collateral consequences. Alternatively, A if the author's action of outing is the main wrong. The key is whether the author's action is morally wrong. Since the author isn't the one who cheated, but is part of the cheating relationship, they might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife. So maybe B.\n"
