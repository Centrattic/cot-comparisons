I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a series of affairs with a married man, who is in the closet. The key points here are the ethical implications of exposing a cheater versus outing someone as gay, especially considering the potential family impact.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone they knew was in a committed relationship. They didn't know he was married, so maybe they were deceived. The man is in the closet and asked for secrecy. Now, the author has to decide whether to tell the wife about the affair, which would out him. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy and informing the wife. The man is cheating, which is wrong, but outing him could have severe consequences for him and his family. The author is considering whether they have a moral obligation to the wife, since the cheating is a betrayal. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel responsible because they were part of the cheating. On the other hand, they might not want to harm the man's family by outing him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they choose to expose the cheating, even if it means outing him.\n\nI need to consider the ethical principles here. Cheating is a breach of trust, and the wife has a right to know if she's being cheated on. However, outing someone without consent can also be a serious violation of privacy, especially if it's against their will or could cause them harm. The author is in a tough spot because they're trying to balance these two conflicting obligations.\n\nThe man's reasons for staying in the closet, like family disapproval, add another layer. If the author tells the wife, they're not only exposing the affair but also revealing his sexuality. That could lead to family problems for him, as his parents are conservative. \n\nFrom a consequentialist perspective, the author might argue that the wife deserves to know because the cheating is hurting her. But from a deontological view, the author might be bound by the promise of secrecy, making it wrong to expose him regardless of the consequences.\n\nThe author might also be considering their own role in the situation. Since they were involved in the affair, maybe they feel some guilt and want to right a wrong by informing the wife. However, they also care about the man and his family, so they're conflicted.\n\nIn terms of legal implications, cheating isn't illegal in most places, so the author isn't breaking any laws. The main issue is moral. The author isn't the one who committed the crime (the cheating), they're the third party.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong if they decide to tell the wife? If they do, they might be violating the man's trust, but they're also helping the wife. If they don't, the wife remains deceived, and the man continues to cheat. The author's actions depend on their moral compass. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide between A or B. Considering the complexity, the author might not be in the wrong for choosing to inform the wife, as the cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. But outing him without his consent is a separate issue. However, the author might not be able to inform the wife without revealing the man's sexuality. \n\nIn this case, the author is in a difficult position where both choices have negative consequences. The act of exposing the cheating is a moral obligation towards the wife, even if it involves outing the man. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as the author is trying to correct a wrong done by the cheater and inform the spouse.\n"
