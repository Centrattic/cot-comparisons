I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person who had multiple affairs with a married man who is also in the closet. The author is conflicted about exposing the man's infidelity, which would also out him as gay, potentially causing family issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a relationship with the man knowing he was married but not initially aware he was gay. After finding out about the marriage and children, they feel conflicted between the wife's right to know and the man's desire to stay closeted. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the cheater. Let's break down the ethical aspects. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal against his wife. The author, as someone who is involved in the affair, may have a moral obligation to inform the wife. However, doing so would out the man, which he is not ready for. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also part of the man's family circle, having a close friendship with his sibling. The author might feel a loyalty there as well. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't the one who cheated. The man is the one who committed infidelity and is hiding his sexuality. The author's mistake might be getting involved in the affair in the first place, but the main issue here is whether they're wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they're not in the wrong because the wife has a right to know about the betrayal. However, outing the man could be seen as a violation of his privacy, even if it's a consequence of revealing the infidelity. The author is trying to balance these two aspects. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on the perspective. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the infidelity. Morally, it's more complex. The author is caught between two conflicting obligations. Since the man is the one who cheated, the author isn't the wrongdoer here. The main wrong is the man's infidelity. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
