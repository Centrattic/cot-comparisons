I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a one-night stand with an usher at their best friend's sister's wedding. The usher was gay and in the closet, so the author promised not to out him. They ended up hooking up multiple times. Now, the author found out the usher is married with kids and has a Grindr account, implying he's cheating on his wife. The author is conflicted between not outing him (to protect him from his conservative parents) and telling the wife, which would involve outing him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's see. The author slept with someone they knew was in a committed relationship, so that's an affair. The usher was in the closet, and the author respected his privacy initially. But now they're considering exposing him to his wife, which would be outing him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, their actions led to an affair, which is unethical. But the main question is about exposing the cheater. The wife has a right to know, but outing someone is a big deal. The author might be trying to do the right thing by informing the wife but causing harm by outing him. \n\nIn terms of betrayal, the author is in a situation where they have to choose between two wrongs: letting the wife be deceived or outed. However, the author's initial decision to engage in the affair is problematic. They might have a responsibility to the wife, but the method of fulfilling that responsibility could be questionable. \n\nIf the author tells the wife anonymously, maybe through a private message or a third party, that might not out the usher. But the scenario says the author's friend's family could be involved if they talk to the wife, and the usher's parents are not accepting. If the author directly tells the wife, it could out the usher. But if they can find a way to inform her without revealing his identity, that might be better. However, the author might not know how to do that, and the situation is complex.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, lying or cheating is considered wrong, but here the author is considering reporting the cheater. However, by engaging in the affair, the author is complicit in the cheating. So their initial actions were wrong. The dilemma now is whether to inform the wife, which is a moral obligation but comes with consequences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposure. \n\nThe answer might depend on the intent. The author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife by exposing the cheater, but the means involve outing him. It's a tough call. However, the user's friend's family might feel betrayed if the author breaks the confidentiality. But the wife has a right to know. \n\nI think the key points are: the author was in an affair, which is their fault. Now, they're trying to do the right thing by telling the wife, which could be seen as trying to make amends. But the act of outing could still be problematic. However, if there's no way to tell the wife without outing, then maybe it's a necessary evil. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The original question is whether they are in the wrong for exposing the cheater by outing him. If the answer is A (yes), then it's because they shouldn't have engaged in the affair to begin with. If B (no), then maybe because they're trying to correct a wrong by informing the wife. \n\nBut the author's main error was participating in the affair. The current dilemma is about whether to expose the cheater. The user's friend's family might not be okay with the author being involved in this. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they are exposing the cheater but in a way that might help her. But by doing so, they are also outing him. So, the author is in a position where they have to weigh the harm of the cheater continuing the affair against the harm of outing him. \n\nIn some ethical views, the greater good might justify the action. But in others, respecting the usher's privacy is paramount. The author might be in the wrong for starting the affair, but when it comes to the current choice, it's a difficult one. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), then the user's thinking aligns. But if the answer is A, then the author is wrong in both the affair and the exposure. \n\nThe question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater, which involves outing him. The user is saying the author is not in the wrong. The dilemma is whether the author is morally obligated to inform the wife despite the outing. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the author is trying to prevent further harm to the wife by exposing the affair, even though it means outing the usher. The initial mistake was the affair, but the decision to inform the wife is a moral one, aiming to right a wrong. However, the method of informing might need to be considered. If the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the usher, that would be better. But given the situation, the author's intent is to do the right thing, so they're not in the wrong for considering it. The complexity is in balancing both parties' rights and the potential consequences.\n"
