I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a complex mix of personal relationships, secrets, and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. They met at a wedding, slept together, and continued the relationship multiple times. The man was married with kids, and the author found out about his marriage later. Now, the author is conflicted about exposing him to his wife (which would out him) versus keeping the secret to protect his family.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was involved in an affair, which is ethically questionable. The man was already in a harmful situation by being in a marriage while in a secret same-sex relationship. The author is considering exposing him, which would out him, but also inform his wife about the infidelity. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, we need to look at both sides. The author had consensual, but non-consensual in terms of the wife's knowledge, relationship with a married man. They knew he was in the closet and promised not to out him. However, after finding out he's married, they feel guilty and want to inform the wife, but that would break the initial promise.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, it's a breach of trust. The author's actions in having the affair might be considered wrong. However, the main question is about the current dilemma: exposing the man to his wife. The author is trying to right a wrong they were part of. But doing so would out him, which could lead to family issues. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we focus on the current decision (exposing him), the author is in a tough spot. However, their initial involvement in the affair is problematic. But the question is about their current situation: whether they're in the wrong for considering to expose him. \n\nThe answer might be A (Yes) because the author was part of the infidelity, so they have some responsibility. But the author is trying to correct their mistake by informing the wife, which could be seen as morally right. But the act of outing him without his consent could be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, since the author was complicit in the affair, they might share in the wrongdoing. However, the dilemma is whether to expose the cheater. The author's position is conflicted between two wrongs. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is considering exposing him, they might be trying to do the right thing, but their initial actions (the affair) were wrong. However, the question is about the current situation, not the past. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nThe answer would depend on perspective. If the author is trying to inform the wife to prevent further harm, that's a moral action. But outing someone without consent is wrong. However, the wife has a right to know. \n\nGiven that, maybe the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. But the initial affair is a separate issue. \n\nBut the question is about the current situation, the author's current dilemma. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater. But the initial affair is a problem. However, the user is asking about the current situation, which is the exposure. \n\nAlternatively, the author is in the wrong because they were part of the affair, so they shouldn't be the one to expose him. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer might be A, as the author is part of the problem, so their intention to expose the cheater might not absolve them. But the author's action is to do the right thing. \n\nIn the end, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the scenario, the author is trying to correct their mistake by exposing the cheater. Even though they were involved, their intention is to inform the wife. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose him, despite being part of the initial affair. However, the act of outing someone is a significant issue. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if their action is right or wrong. The author's current action (exposing) might be morally justified, but they are caught between two wrongs. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is likely A (Yes) because the author was part of the affair, which is wrong. However, the question is about the current situation of exposing. The user might be asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to expose. \n\nAlternatively, since the author is trying to do the right thing for the wife, the answer is B. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they were involved in the affair, which is a breach of trust and possibly harmful. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. If the author is taking responsibility for their actions by informing the wife, that might be the right thing. \n\nBut the initial affair is a separate issue. The answer to the question is about the current dilemma: exposing the cheater. The author is trying to correct a wrong, so they might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
