I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who's in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, who's out of the country. The author found out about the marriage and the kids, and now is conflicted between telling the wife (which would out him) or staying silent. The author is asking if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA) for exposing him.\n\nThe main ethical dilemma here is between the duty to inform the wronged spouse (the wife) about the infidelity and respecting the man's privacy regarding his sexual orientation. The author is trying to balance these two. \n\nOn one hand, the man is cheating, which is a betrayal of his marriage. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person is in the closet and their family might not accept it. The author also mentions that the man's parents wouldn't react well to him being gay, adding another layer of potential harm.\n\nBut the author is in a tricky position. They were in a consensual relationship with the man, who was married. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. Now that they do, they're conflicted. The question is whether the author is obligated to inform the wife, even if it means outing him. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's a conflict between two ethical principles: fidelity (the man's betrayal) and privacy (the man's desire to stay closeted). The author isn't the one who cheated; they were part of the affair, but they might feel responsible for the wife knowing. However, the author's primary responsibility isn't necessarily to the wife. They were not directly involved in the marriage, so the duty to inform might not be as strong as the duty to protect someone's privacy, especially when the man is vulnerable.\n\nAdditionally, the author is considering whether there's a way to inform the wife without outing him. That shows they're trying to find a middle ground. However, in this case, it might be impossible because the infidelity is tied to his being gay. So the act of informing the wife would inherently reveal his sexual orientation. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if they choose to inform the wife, they might be seen as violating the man's privacy, but they're also protecting the wife from further harm. If they choose not to inform the wife, they're allowing the cheating to continue, which could harm the wife. \n\nBut since the author is not a family member or directly involved in the marriage, their obligation might be less. The author's main mistake could be not checking the man's marital status before engaging in the relationship. However, the situation is more complex because the man was in the closet. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult spot. They might not be in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, given the cheating involved, but they also need to consider the consequences of outing someone. However, the act of informing the wife without a direct relationship might be seen as overstepping, so there's a case for both sides. But based on the options, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing in a complicated situation.\n"
