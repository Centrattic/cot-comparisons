I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also closeted. The author is considering exposing the cheater to his wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the affair and the potential exposure of the man's sexuality. The author was involved in a relationship with someone who is married, which is cheating. However, the man is in a closeted relationship, and the author initially agreed to keep his secret. \n\nThe author's dilemma is whether to inform the wife about the cheating, which would require outing the man. The question is about the author's moral responsibility. If the author is cheating and then decides to expose the cheater, does that make them right or wrong?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong. The author's involvement in the extramarital affair is a factor here. By participating in the affair, the author is complicit in the man's infidelity. However, the author is now conflicted because they want to do the right thing by the wife but don't want to out the man, which could harm him and his family.\n\nThe author's position is complicated because they are in a wrong situation themselves (cheating) but are trying to correct it by exposing the cheater. However, the act of informing the wife would involve breaching confidentiality and outing someone's sexuality, which is a serious matter. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial act of cheating is a factor. But the author's intention now is to inform the wronged party. However, the author's own participation in the affair complicates their position. They might not be in the right position to take a moral high ground. Additionally, outing someone's sexuality can have severe consequences, and the author's decision here could be seen as violating the man's privacy, even if the intention is to help the wife. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the author is part of the cheating scenario, which is a wrongdoing, and their plan to expose the cheater involves a breach of confidentiality that could harm the man. Therefore, the author is in the wrong both for participating in the affair and for potentially causing further harm by outing him. However, there's a nuance here because they are trying to do the right thing for the wife. But the initial act of cheating is a key point here. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their involvement in the affair is a significant factor, and their plan to expose the cheater by outing him is also problematic. Even if the intention is good, the action is harmful and stems from their own participation in the wrong.\n"
