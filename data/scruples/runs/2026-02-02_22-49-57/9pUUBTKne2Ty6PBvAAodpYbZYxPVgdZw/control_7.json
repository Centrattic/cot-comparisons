I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a relationship with a married man who's also gay and closeted. They found out he's cheating on his wife, and now they're torn between exposing him to his wife (which would out him) or keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, the author was aware he was in a committed marriage but still continued the affair. That's a problem because cheating is generally considered wrong. Even if he's not the only one, being in an affair is a breach of trust. The fact that he's in the closet complicates things because outing someone can have serious consequences, especially if the family is not accepting. \n\nBut the author is also in a dilemma about whether to tell his wife. On one hand, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. On the other hand, outing the husband could harm his family and his personal life. However, the author's actions led to the situation where they have to make this choice. \n\nThe key point here is that the author is responsible for the affair. They knew he was married but still engaged in multiple hookups. That's a big part of the issue. Even if they feel bad about the situation now, their initial decision to be in a relationship with a married man is a problem. Then, they're trying to decide whether to expose him to his wife, which might be justified as a moral obligation, but the fact remains that they were complicit in the affair. \n\nAlso, the author made promises of confidentiality when the man came out to them. Breaking that trust to tell the wife could be seen as a betrayal, even if it's for a good reason. But the wife's right to know is also important. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they participated in the affair, which is cheating, they are at least partially at fault. The dilemma about whether to inform the wife is a separate issue, but their own actions contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer is likely A, they are in the wrong for being involved in the affair, even if they're conflicted about the next steps.\n"
