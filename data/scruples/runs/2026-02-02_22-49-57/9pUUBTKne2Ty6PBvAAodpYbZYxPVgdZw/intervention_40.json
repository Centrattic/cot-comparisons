I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. They didn't know he was married when they started sleeping together. Now they found out he's married with kids, and the wife has a right to know. The dilemma is whether to tell her, even if it out him as gay, which might not go over well with his family.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. On one hand, the wife deserves to know she's been cheated on. On the other, outing someone can be a violation of their privacy, especially if they're not ready. But there's also the ethical consideration of preventing harm to the wife. The author's friend's family might not accept the man's sexuality, so outing him could cause family turmoil.\n\nIs there a middle ground? The author wonders if they can inform the wife without outing him. Maybe there's a way to report the infidelity without revealing his sexuality. For example, if the wife could be told that her husband is cheating without specifying details that out him as gay. But the author might be part of the husband's circle, so the wife might figure out it's him through the information given.\n\nBut if the only way to inform the wife is by outing him, then the author has to weigh the right of the wife against the potential harm to the husband and his family. The author is also concerned about their own role in the affair. They had consensual relations, but the husband was married. The author might be partially responsible, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife.\n\nIn some ethical frameworks, the duty to prevent harm to the wife might outweigh the duty to protect the husband's privacy. However, if outing him could lead to significant personal and family issues, it's a tough call. The author could be seen as trying to do the right thing by protecting the wife, even if it means some collateral damage. Alternatively, they might be violating the husband's autonomy to come out on his own terms.\n\nI think the key here is whether there's a way to inform the wife without outing him. If not, then the author is in a bind. But if the answer is that the author is not in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, even if it out him, then the answer would be B. However, if there's a way to do it without outing him, maybe the author should try that first. But given the information, the author might not have that option. So the author's intent is to prevent harm to the wife, which could be seen as the right thing, even if it causes other issues. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
