I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author had a relationship with someone who was married and closeted. They found out he's cheating, and now they're conflicted about exposing him to his wife.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know he was married when they started the affair. They were at a wedding, got drunk, and then continued the relationship. The man was in the closet, so the author promised not to out him. But now they found out he's cheating on his wife, who's out of the country with the kids. The author wants to tell the wife but doesn't want to out him to his family, especially since his parents might not accept his sexuality.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they expose him to his wife, which would out him. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm, from a moral standpoint, the author is in a tough spot. The man is cheating, and the wife has a right to know. But outing someone without their consent is a big deal, especially if it's against their wishes. The author also cares about his well-being and family. There's a conflict between loyalty to the wife and respecting the man's privacy. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, they might be protecting her from betrayal but hurting the man's family. If they don't tell, the wife remains unaware. But the author could try to find a way to inform the wife without using their name or outing him publicly. However, in practice, it's hard to do that. \n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to tell the wife, but ethically, it's a gray area. Cheating is a personal matter, but the wife's right to know is important. The author's actions are based on protecting another person's spouse from infidelity, which is a valid concern. However, outing the man could have severe consequences for him and his family, especially given his parents' potential reaction. \n\nThe author's intentions matter here. They want to do the right thing, even though it's hard. They might not be in the wrong because they're trying to balance two conflicting obligations. But is it their responsibility to step in? Maybe not. The author could choose to tell the wife anonymously or find a third party. Ultimately, the decision is complex, but the author's desire to inform the wife isn't necessarily wrong, especially considering the wife's right to know about the cheating. However, the method of disclosure is crucial to minimize harm. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
