I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. So, first, the author slept with someone who's married and gay, and the guy was in the closet. The author didn't know he was married and had kids until later. Now, the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife he cheated, but doing so would out him, which he wasn't ready for.\n\nHmm. The author is considering exposing the cheater by telling the wife, which would mean outing him. The guy didn't want to be outed, and his parents might not handle it well. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author is caught between two bad options. \n\nOn one hand, cheating is morally wrong, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent, especially in a family that isn't accepting, could cause serious harm. The author also had a relationship with the guy, which complicates things. They became good friends, so maybe there's a sense of loyalty there. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't know he was married when they started their relationship. So maybe they weren't intentionally cheating. The guy was the one who was unfaithful to his wife. The author is now faced with the dilemma of whether to protect the guy's privacy or protect the wife. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering telling the wife? If they do tell the wife, they're exposing the cheating, which is the right thing for the wife, but outing the guy against his wishes. However, the guy is the one who was deceptive. He didn't disclose his marital status or that he's gay initially. The author trusted him and he broke that trust by not being honest. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were deceived. The guy is the one who's at fault for cheating and lying. The author is trying to do the right thing by considering telling the wife, even though it's a tough choice. But is it their responsibility to step in? The author isn't directly related to the marriage, just through friendship with the best friend's sister. Maybe they overstepped by getting involved in the first place. \n\nBut given that the author cares about the guy and doesn't want to out him, but also feels responsible to the wife, it's a tough spot. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were the victim of deception. The real issue is the guy's actions, not the author's decision to expose the cheating, even if it leads to outing him. However, the author has to weigh the consequences of outing him versus keeping silent. \n\nI think the key point is that the author isn't the one who cheated; the guy did. The author is trying to make a difficult moral choice. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
