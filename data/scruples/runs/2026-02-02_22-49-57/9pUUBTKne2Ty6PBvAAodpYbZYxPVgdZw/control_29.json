I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male who's married and has kids. The married man is gay and in the closet. The author found out the man is married and cheating, and now wants to tell the wife but is worried about outing him. The dilemma is between exposing the cheating and outing him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married. The married man was cheating, so the author is complicit in that infidelity. But the author didn't know about the marriage at first. However, after finding out, they continued the relationship, which might be problematic. Also, the author is considering exposing the cheating, which would mean revealing his sexuality, which the man wanted to keep private.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't initiate the affair but was part of it. The man was married and cheating, which is wrong on his part. The author is now deciding whether to tell the wife, which would out him. The author had promised not to tell anyone, so breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal. However, the author is also trying to do the right thing by the wife, who has a right to know about the infidelity.\n\nBut the key points here are: the author is part of the infidelity, which is an issue. The author is now trying to balance between two wrongs. The man is cheating, which is a problem, but outing him could have serious consequences for him, especially if his family is not accepting. The author might be in the wrong for being involved in the affair in the first place, especially after finding out he was married. Also, the author might not have the right to decide who else knows about the affair. However, the author is trying to warn the wife, which could be seen as a moral obligation.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater, even if it out him. The author's actions in the affair might make them complicit, but the decision to inform the wife is a moral choice. The question is if the author is in the wrong regardless of their intentions.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong for being involved in the affair after knowing the man was married. But the post is more about the dilemma of whether to expose the cheater. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation. Since the author is part of the cheating, that's a problem. But the question is more about the act of exposing the cheater. Depending on perspective, but maybe the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they were part of the infidelity and now are complicating the situation by considering to expose it, which could out the man. So the answer might be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong.\n"
