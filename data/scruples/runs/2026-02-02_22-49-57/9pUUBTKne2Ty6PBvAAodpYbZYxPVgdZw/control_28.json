I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a moral dilemma about whether to expose a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The key points here are the author's actions and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with the married man, not knowing he was married. The man was in the closet, so the author didn't know he was gay either. Now, the author found out and is conflicted between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy.\n\nThe author is asking if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA) for exposing the cheater by telling the wife, which would out him. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The man cheated, so the wife has a right to know. But outing someone without their consent, especially regarding their sexuality, is a big deal. However, the author might argue that the wife's right to know about the infidelity is more important than the man's privacy. \n\nBut wait, the author is also in a position where they were involved in the affair. They might be considered an accomplice or at least complicit in the cheating. However, since they didn't know about the marriage initially, maybe that's not the case. The author's intention to tell the wife could be seen as trying to do the right thing by exposing the cheating, even if it out the man. \n\nBut there's a conflict here. Outing someone can have serious consequences, especially if the family is not accepting. The author is trying to balance the wife's rights with the man's privacy. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to expose the cheater. \n\nIf the author is in the right, then B. If they're wrong for outing someone despite the cheating, then A. But is there a way to inform the wife without outing him? The author is struggling with that. \n\nIn terms of morality, typically, a spouse has a right to know about infidelity. But outing someone's sexuality is a different matter. However, in this case, the two are tied together because the author can't inform the wife without revealing the man's sexuality. \n\nThe author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but at the cost of the man's privacy. Is that wrong? It depends on the ethical framework. Some might say the author has a duty to the wife, others might say respecting the man's privacy is more important. \n\nThe author was also involved in the affair, which complicates things. They might have a responsibility to both the wife and the man. However, their primary obligation could be to the wife since they were the one cheated on. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not wrong) because the author is trying to inform the wife of the infidelity, which is a valid concern, even if it means outing the man. However, if the author is using the wife as a means to avoid the moral dilemma of outing the man, that could be different. But given the information, the author is genuinely conflicted and trying to do the right thing. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it means outing him. The answer is B.\n"
