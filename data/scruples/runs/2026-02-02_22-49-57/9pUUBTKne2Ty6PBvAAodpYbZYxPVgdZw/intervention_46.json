I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheating spouse while also outing him as gay. The scenario is complex with multiple layers.\n\nFirst, the author had a series of affairs with a married man who is in the closet. The man asked him not to out him, and the author initially respected that. But upon discovering the man's marriage and children, the author feels conflicted. The dilemma is whether to inform the wife about the infidelity, which would out him as gay, or to remain silent.\n\nMorally, cheating is generally considered wrong, so the man is at fault for being unfaithful. The author, on the other hand, is in a position where they know about the infidelity and have a moral obligation to the wife. However, outing someone's sexual orientation without their consent is a violation of their privacy, even if it's to expose a cheating spouse.\n\nBut here's the catch: if the author tells the wife, they are outing the man, which might have serious consequences for him and his family. The author is caught between protecting the wife's rights and respecting the man's privacy. The man's closeted status complicates things because his actions (using Grindr) might indicate he's aware of the risks, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility.\n\nLegally, the wife might have grounds for divorce or other legal actions if she knows about the infidelity. However, the author isn't legally obligated to inform the wife. Morally, it's a tough call. The author could argue they're protecting the wife from harm, but also causing harm to the man and his family by outing him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author decides to inform the wife, they might be justified in wanting to protect someone from betrayal. However, outing someone's sexuality without consent is a serious issue. The author's initial decision to keep the man's secret was respected until the cheating came to light. Now, the dilemma is whether the ends justify the means.\n\nIn this case, the author isn't intentionally outting the man; it's a consequence of exposing the infidelity. But the act of outing is still a violation. However, the wife has a right to know about the cheating. The author is in a tough spot. Since the author didn't commit the cheating themselves, they might not be in the wrong for trying to help the wife. Alternatively, they could be seen as violating the man's privacy without a clear right to do so.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to inform the wronged party about the infidelity, even though it has collateral consequences. The key is whether the author is morally obligated to inform the wife despite the outing. Since the man's closeted status is part of the cheating, the author's action could be seen as a necessary evil to protect the wife. However, this is a nuanced situation without a clear right or wrong answer.\n"
