I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author having an affair with a married man who is also gay and in the closet. The author found out he's married and wants to tell his wife but is worried about outing him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with someone who was married and not out. The man is cheating on his wife, which is clearly wrong. The author is conflicted between exposing the cheating (which would out him) and protecting his privacy. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for possibly exposing the cheater by informing the wife. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but it might out the man. However, the man is already cheating, which is a betrayal. The dilemma is between two wrongs: the man's infidelity and the author's potential outing.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between privacy and the wife's right to know. The author might feel obligated to tell the wife because cheating is a serious issue. But outing someone without their consent is also a violation of privacy. However, the man is the one who started the affair, so there's a question of who's at fault here.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. On one hand, they're helping the wife by revealing the infidelity. On the other, they're outing someone. But since the man is already cheating, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The man's actions are the root cause. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the wife, even if it means outing the cheater. However, is there a way to inform the wife without outing him? The author is trying to find a middle ground.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. Considering that the man is the cheater, and the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it's a difficult choice. The author's intent matters here. If they're acting to prevent further harm to the wife, their intent is good. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But need to make sure there's no other angle. Could the author be blamed for the affair itself? Well, the affair is consensual, but the man is the one cheating. The author's main issue is the exposure part. Since the author is trying to protect the wife's rights, even if it causes conflict, they're not in the wrong. So, B.\n"
