I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a married man who's having an affair with the author, and the author is considering exposing the cheating to the man's wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author slept with a married man, which is cheating on his wife. The author might be in the wrong here because they were in a relationship with someone who was already married. But wait, the author wasn't in a relationship with the married man; they were just having casual encounters. So the author's mistake was engaging in a relationship with a married person, which is ethically questionable but not necessarily illegal. The author's friend's sister is married, but the author wasn't part of that marriage, so the main issue is the infidelity of the married man.\n\nNow, the author found out the husband is cheating and is conflicted about exposing him. The husband is also in the closet, so outing him could lead to family issues. The author wants to protect his privacy but also feels the wife has a right to know. \n\nSo the key points are: Did the author wrong the husband by sleeping with him? Or the wife by not exposing the cheating? The author's actions led to being in an affair with a married man, which is morally ambiguous. However, the author was deceived by the husband's secrecy. The husband is the one in a committed relationship and broke that trust. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they're helping the wife know the truth, which could be the right thing. But outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a violation of privacy. However, in this case, the author is exposing the infidelity, which is a separate issue from his sexuality. However, revealing that he's married and cheating might inadvertently out him as gay, depending on the context. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for sleeping with a married man? Possibly, but the husband is the one who initiated the affair. The author might have consented but didn't know the full context. The author's dilemma is about whether to inform the wife, which is a moral decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the husband. \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it's for being in an affair with a married person. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation as a whole. The answer might be B (No) because the author is trying to do the right thing by considering informing the wife, even if they were involved in an affair. The main wrongdoer here is the husband for cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author's actions after discovering the marriage are more about trying to set things right.\n"
