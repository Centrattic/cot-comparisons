I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old usher at his best friend's sister's wedding. The usher told him he's gay and not out yet, so the author promised not to tell anyone. They hooked up multiple times. Later, the author finds out the usher is married with two kids. He confronts him, and the usher is upset, saying he wants to leave his wife but feels stuck because of the kids. Now the author is torn between not outing the man but also feeling obligated to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out him.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author had consensual relationships with someone who was already married and in a secret same-sex relationship. The author didn't know about the marriage at the time, but after finding out, he's conflicted about whether to expose the cheating (which would out the man) or stay silent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for potentially exposing the cheater? Well, the author was deceived. The usher lied about his relationship status. The author didn't know the man was married when they had sex. Now, the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. But the problem is that revealing this would also out the man as gay, which he's not ready for, and his family might not accept it.\n\nSo, legally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, the author might feel conflicted. The author's main dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy regarding his sexuality and the wife's right to know about the betrayal. The author might be in a position where he's not the best person to make that decision. Maybe the wife should find out through her own means, but the author has information that could help her. However, outing someone without their consent can be a violation of their autonomy, especially if they're not ready.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for wanting to act in the wife's best interest, but the method of doing so could be problematic. The question is whether the author has the right to make that decision. Perhaps the author should consider if there's another way to inform the wife without outing the man, like through a lawyer or a mediator, but the scenario says the author isn't sure how to do that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was part of an affair that was consensual. The man was in a committed marriage and lied about his status. The author might feel guilty because he was also involved in a relationship that wasn't honest. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the author didn't know the man was married, maybe he's not at fault. However, if the author had asked more about the man's relationship status before sleeping with him, he might have found out. But in reality, people can be dishonest about their relationships.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the man. The ethical dilemma is complex, but the author's intent is to do the right thing by the wife. However, the method might be questionable. But since the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong), the answer would be B.\n"
