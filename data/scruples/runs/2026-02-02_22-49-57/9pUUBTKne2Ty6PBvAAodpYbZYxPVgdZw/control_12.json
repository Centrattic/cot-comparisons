I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 20 years old, had a relationship with a married man who's 23. The man is gay, in the closet, and married to a woman with two kids. He cheated with the author multiple times, and the author is now torn between exposing him (which would out him as gay) to his wife or keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The author is considering telling the wife about the cheating, which would out her husband as gay. The author is concerned about outing him, given his family's potential reaction. But the author also feels a moral obligation to the wife, who has a right to know she's been cheated on.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author had consensual relationships with the man when they didn't know he was married. The man was the one who lied about his marital status and his sexuality, using the closet as a reason to keep it secret. The author didn't know initially, so the cheating was on the man's part. The author is now trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, which is a difficult position.\n\nBut outing someone's sexuality without their consent is a big deal. However, in this case, the author is doing it to inform the wife of infidelity. There's a conflict between the man's right to privacy and the wife's right to know. The author is in a tough spot because they care about both the wife and the man. \n\nSome might argue that the author is not in the wrong because the man was the one who was deceitful. The author is trying to help the wife by exposing the cheating, even though it out him. Others might say the author is overstepping by involving themselves in the man's personal life and family matters. \n\nBut legally, the man's affair is a private matter between him and his wife. The author isn't legally obligated to inform the wife. However, ethically, there's a debate. If the author doesn't tell the wife, they might be complicit in the cheating. But if they do tell, they might be causing harm to the man and his family. \n\nSince the author is not the one who committed the infidelity, they might not be in the wrong. The main wrongdoer here is the married man who lied. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, even though it complicates things. The answer is probably B (No), because the author is trying to act in the wife's interest after being deceived by the man. The author isn't the cheater; they were a victim of the man's deceit.\n"
