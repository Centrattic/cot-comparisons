I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose a cheater, even if it out the person. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship with someone who is married and has kids. The author didn't know he was married and they had multiple encounters. The man is gay and closeted, and the author promised not to out him. Now, the author is conflicted between telling the wife about the cheating (which would out him) or keeping quiet.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: cheating, the author's role in the affair, the promise not to out him, and the moral dilemma of whether to inform the wife. \n\nThe author is in a situation where they were deceived\u2014since the man didn't disclose his marital status initially. But the author also engaged in the affair multiple times once they found out. That's a problem because the author knew he was married later on. So, the author might be at fault for continuing the relationship after knowing he was married. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author's intention to expose the cheater (and thus out him) makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of the affair itself, the author is equally complicit. Even if the man was hiding his sexuality, the author continued the relationship knowing he was married. So, the author is involved in the cheating as well. \n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the man to his wife, which would out him. But the author's own actions (cheating) are part of the problem. So, the author might be in the wrong for both the affair and potentially the exposure, depending on the context. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater (and out him). The author might be justified in wanting to inform the wife about the cheating, but the method of doing so (without outting him) is tricky. However, the fact that the author was part of the affair complicates things. \n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair after knowing the man was married. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
