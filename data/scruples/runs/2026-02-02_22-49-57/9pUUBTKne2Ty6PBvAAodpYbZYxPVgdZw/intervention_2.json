I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex because the author had an affair with a married man who's in the closet. He's now conflicted between not wanting to out the man (due to family issues) and feeling the wife has a right to know.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married. That's cheating, so the author is complicit in the infidelity. But the main ethical dilemma here is whether to inform the wife, which would also out the man as gay. The author is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know about the cheating.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the key points. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the relationship, but after finding out, they're trying to do the right thing by the wife. However, by exposing the cheating, they risk outing him, which could have serious consequences for him and his family.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial relationship was consensual between two adults, but it's still an affair. The author is now trying to balance between two harmful outcomes: harming the man's privacy or the wife's trust. Ethically, there's a duty to the wife because she's being cheated on. However, outing someone against their will is a violation of their privacy too. \n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, the author isn't obligated to report this. Morally, it's tricky. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to inform the wife, but they could be in the wrong if they do it in a way that's unethical or harmful. For example, if the author reveals the man's sexuality without his consent, that's a violation of his privacy, regardless of the cheating. \n\nSo, the answer here depends on whether the author can inform the wife without outing the man. If they can do that, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they have to out him to inform the wife, then they might be causing harm. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering it. The author is in a moral dilemma, not necessarily in the wrong for trying to do the right thing. But the act of exposing the cheating might involve outing, which complicates things. \n\nThe answer is B (No), because the author is caught in a complex situation where both actions have consequences. They're trying to balance two ethical obligations. The author isn't clearly in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method matters. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether the action is right. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering it, as it's a moral dilemma without a perfect answer.\n"
