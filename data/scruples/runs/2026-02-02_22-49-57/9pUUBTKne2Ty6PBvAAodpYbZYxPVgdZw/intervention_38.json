I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong when considering whether to expose a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, the author had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and has kids. The man is in the closet, so the author promised not to out him. But now, the author found out he's cheating and is conflicted about whether to tell the wife, which would involve outing him. \n\nThe author is trying to balance confidentiality and the wife's right to know. On one hand, the author was involved in an affair, which they regret, especially since they know how it feels to be cheated on. They might feel a duty to the wife. On the other hand, outing someone's sexual orientation without consent is a big deal, even if they're cheating.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is considering exposing the cheater's infidelity, which is a separate issue from his sexuality. The problem is that revealing the affair would also disclose that he's gay. The author might be in a tough spot because they want to do the right thing for the wife but don't want to violate the man's privacy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were part of the affair, which is unethical. But now they're trying to make amends by informing the wife. The key is whether they have the right to expose someone else's secrets, even if it's to prevent harm. Also, the author's own actions (sleeping with someone they knew was married) contribute to the problem. They might have a duty to the wife, but they also made a promise to the man. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether there's a way to inform the wife without outing him. If the author can find another way, that would be better. But since they can't, they have to decide. However, the author is not the one who started the cheating; they were involved but are now trying to correct a mistake. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough situation. They might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing, but their initial actions (sleeping with a married man) are problematic. However, the core question is whether exposing the cheater makes them wrong. If the author is trying to protect the wife's rights, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they're overstepping by outing him, then maybe they are. It's a complex moral issue.\n"
