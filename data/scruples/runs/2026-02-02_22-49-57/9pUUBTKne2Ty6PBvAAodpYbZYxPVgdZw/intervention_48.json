I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The key points here are the relationships involved and the potential consequences.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old male who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. He found out later that this man is married with two kids, so that's cheating. The usher is in the closet and asked the author to keep it a secret. Now the author is conflicted because he wants to inform the wife about the infidelity but doesn't want to out the man to his family, who might not react well.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is morally wrong to expose the cheater, even if it out him. From an ethical standpoint, there are a few considerations. The wife has a right to know about the infidelity, as it's a betrayal in her marriage. However, outing someone without consent can be a serious violation of their privacy, especially if it causes harm to their family and personal life.\n\nThe author might think he's helping the wife by revealing the infidelity, but doing so through outing the husband could lead to unintended consequences. The husband might not be ready to come out, and the author's actions could damage the husband's relationships with his parents and kids, which the author mentioned the husband's parents would not respond well to. \n\nBut is there a way to inform the wife without outing the husband? The author could potentially find a way to anonymously tell the wife, maybe through a message or a third party who can relay the information without revealing the husband's sexuality. If the author can't keep the secret and wants to be honest, but also respects the husband's privacy, then the right approach would be to inform the wife without disclosing the husband's sexual orientation. \n\nHowever, in reality, it might be difficult to separate the two facts. The wife might find out about the infidelity and the sexuality if the author is identified as the other man. So the author might not have a clear option here. But the question is about being in the wrong. Generally, people have a duty to not out others without consent, even if it's to expose a wrong. The infidelity is a separate issue, but the method of exposing it (outing) complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's right to know is important. Cheating is a breach of trust in the marriage. But the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the husband did. The author's role here is that of someone who was involved after the fact. The author's dilemma is between two ethical obligations: respecting the husband's privacy and helping the wife. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, it's a tough call. However, the author was complicit in the cheating by continuing the relationship. But now they're trying to do the right thing by informing the wife. The problem is the means by which they do it. If the author decides to out the husband, that could be seen as violating a confidentiality that was promised. But if the wife is being cheated on, there's a case for her needing to know. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but the user is asking for a yes or no. The author's main issue is the method of exposure. They can be in the wrong if they out the husband, but if they find a way to inform the wife without revealing his sexuality, they might not be. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater by outing him, the answer would depend on the method. If they proceed without a way to keep it anonymous, then they are in the wrong for outing him. If they can do it anonymously, maybe not. But as the situation stands, the author hasn't taken action yet. The question is about intending to expose, which could be wrong if it involves outing. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user already said they think the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate from scratch. The author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, but the means involve outing the husband. Is the author in the wrong for that? If the author can find a way to inform the wife without outing the husband, then it's better. But if the only way is to out him, then the author's intention is to expose the infidelity, which is valid, but the method (outing) is problematic. So the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but could be in the wrong if the action leads to outing. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to expose the cheater if it means outing him. Since they are asking if they should do it, maybe they are seeking advice on how to do it without outing, so the answer could be B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that the author is in the wrong because they promised confidentiality and breaking that could hurt the husband. But the husband is the cheater. So the author is in a tough spot. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author's intention to inform the wife is morally justifiable, even if it's a difficult situation. The mistake would be in how they do it, but the dilemma itself doesn't necessarily make them wrong. They are trying to correct a wrong (the infidelity) but have to balance it with the husband's privacy. So the answer is B.\n"
