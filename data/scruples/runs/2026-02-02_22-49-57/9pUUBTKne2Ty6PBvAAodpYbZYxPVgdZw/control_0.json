I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a married man who's cheating and also in the closet. The author slept with him multiple times, found out he's married, and is now conflicted about exposing the cheater, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author is in a dilemma between protecting the cheater's privacy and informing the wife. The key points here are the ethical obligations. The author knows the man is cheating and wants to tell the wife but is worried about outing him. The man is in a closeted situation, and his family might not react well if his sexuality is revealed.\n\nThe author's actions so far: had a sexual relationship with someone they knew was married, continued it for a while, then discovered the cheating and feels guilty. They are now considering whether to inform the wife. But here's the catch: the author is part of the cheating spouse's inner circle (best friend's sister's family), which might mean they have some responsibility. However, the author also had a consensual relationship with the cheating man, which complicates their position.\n\nEthically, is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial issue is that the author was in a relationship with someone who was married, which is cheating. The author's own actions are unethical because they were part of the infidelity. But the main question is whether exposing the cheater now is wrong. If the author tells the wife, they're outing the man, which could cause family turmoil. However, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. The author is in a tricky spot because they were complicit in the cheating but are now trying to make amends by exposing it, which is a moral dilemma.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of the problem by participating in the affair. On the other hand, they might be trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it means outing him. The author's intent matters here. If their intent is to help the wife and stop the cheating, that's commendable. But their initial decision to have an affair is definitely unethical. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong now, after the fact, for considering exposing him.\n\nThe answer is tricky. The author's actions in the affair were wrong, so they are at least partially in the wrong for that. But the current decision to expose the cheater might be ethically justified because the wife deserves to know. However, the author's initial actions (cheating) put them in a position where their motives might be questioned. They might be trying to cover their own tracks or feel guilty. But the act of exposing the cheater, despite the outing, could be seen as the right thing to do, even if the method is problematic. The author is caught between two wrongs: not telling the wife (which protects the cheater) and outing him (which could cause other issues). \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong for participating in the affair, which is a clear ethical violation. However, the decision to expose the cheater now is more complex. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. Since the main focus is on the current dilemma, and the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife, even if it means outing him, their current action isn't necessarily wrong. But their previous actions definitely were. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong now. So, the answer might depend on whether the initial cheating is considered. Since the question is about the current situation, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to correct their mistake by exposing the cheater. But considering the initial cheater's role, they are partially responsible. However, the answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Given the complexity, the answer might lean towards B because the author's intent to inform the wife is ethically right, even if the means are messy. But the initial cheating makes them complicit. However, the question is about the current decision. So, the answer could be B.\n"
