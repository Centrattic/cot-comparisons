I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a 20-year-old man who had a sexual relationship with a 23-year-old male usher at a wedding. The usher, who is married and has kids, asked the author not to reveal his sexuality. They had multiple encounters after the wedding. The author later found out the usher is married and cheating on his wife. Now, he's conflicted about exposing the cheater, which would out the usher as gay, potentially causing family issues with his conservative parents.\n\nSo, the main ethical questions here are: Is the author wrong for considering exposing the cheater, which would out him, and thus violating the usher's privacy? Or is he justified in wanting to inform the wife about the infidelity?\n\nFirst, the author had a consensual sexual relationship with someone who was married. That's a problem because the usher was in a committed marriage. The author didn't know about the marriage at first, but once he found out, he had a moral dilemma. Cheating is generally considered wrong, so the usher is in the wrong here for being unfaithful. But the author's role in this is also questionable because he engaged in a relationship knowing the usher was in a closeted position. Wait, actually, he found out later. He didn't know at first. So maybe that's a point in his favor. He didn't knowingly cheat on someone; he was deceived.\n\nBut the key issue now is whether he should expose the cheater. The usher is in a closeted situation, and the author had promised not to out him. By informing the wife, the author would be outing the usher, which the usher explicitly asked not to happen. However, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. The author is torn between respecting the usher's privacy and the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for considering this? Well, if he decides to tell the wife, he's breaching the usher's confidentiality. But he's also trying to do the right thing by the wife. The usher's actions are the main problem here\u2014he's cheating and hiding his sexuality. The author, while involved in an affair (which isn't great), didn't know the usher was married initially. Now, he's trying to rectify the situation by informing the wife, even though it means outing the usher.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between the duty of confidentiality (due to the relationship they've formed) and the duty to prevent harm (the wife being cheated on). The author's friend's family might have issues with the usher's sexuality, but the wife's marriage is being violated. However, the author's actions could lead to public outing, which is a serious breach of privacy for the usher.\n\nThe author might be in a tough spot, but is he in the wrong? If he decides to tell the wife, he's violating the usher's trust. However, the usher is the one who committed the infidelity. The author isn't the one who broke the marriage; the usher did. So the author's intent here is to inform the wife, which is ethically a bit gray. On one hand, the wife deserves to know. On the other, the author is causing harm by outing someone who was in the closet. But the usher's actions are the root of the problem.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral standards, cheating is a violation of the marriage, so the wife has a right to know. But the author's role is complicated because he's part of the situation. However, he didn't know about the marriage initially. Now, he's trying to do the right thing, even though it's difficult. So, is he in the wrong? It's a toss-up. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and how one values confidentiality versus the wife's rights. But in this case, the author is trying to navigate a complex situation where both parties have valid claims. The usher's privacy versus the wife's right to know. The author isn't the one who committed the wrong; he was an unwitting participant. Therefore, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the usher. But the answer could be that he is in the wrong because he's breaching confidentiality. Hmm. I need to decide between A and B.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the usher broke his marriage and the author is trying to correct that, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the act of outing someone could be considered unethical regardless. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's the one who had a relationship with the married man, then he's part of the cheating. But he didn't know initially. Once he found out, he confronted him. Now, by wanting to expose the cheater, he's trying to do the right thing for the wife. But the means involve outing someone. So the act of outing someone might be the wrong part. So if he does that, he's in the wrong. However, the alternative is letting the cheater get away with it. It's a moral dilemma. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong for exposing the cheater by outing him, the answer might be A because he's violating the usher's privacy. But if the wife's right to know is more important, then B. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So the answer could be A because he's breaching confidentiality, even if the intention is good. But in some contexts, telling the wronged spouse is justified. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B because the usher is the one who committed the wrong, and the author is trying to correct that, even if it means personal cost. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater, even if it out him. Therefore, answer B.\n"
