I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author (a 20-year-old man) had a sexual relationship with a married man (23 years old) who is in the closet. They met at a wedding, the man was an usher, and they ended up sleeping together. The man asked the author not to tell anyone because he's gay and not ready to come out. They continued the relationship multiple times. Later, the author finds out the man is married with two kids and realizes he's been cheating. The author feels guilty and conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the infidelity, which would out the man to his family and possibly others.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had a consensual relationship, but the man is married and cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage when the relationship started. The man is in the closet, so coming out is a big deal for him and his family. The author is torn between the wife's right to know and the potential harm of outing the man.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider the ethics. Cheating is generally considered wrong, but the author here was the other person, not the cheater. The man is the one who's in a committed marriage and having an affair. The author didn't know about the marriage initially, so there's no deception from the author's side. The author respected the man's desire not to come out, which shows consideration for his privacy.\n\nHowever, the author is now considering exposing the cheating, which would out the man. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and protecting the man's privacy. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as cheating is a serious betrayal. However, doing so would out the man, which could have severe consequences for him and his family. But the author is not obligated to stay silent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheater. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the wife deserves to know about the infidelity, even if it leads to outing the husband. Alternatively, some might say the author shouldn't be involved in the man's marriage and should leave it to him to decide. But since the author was part of the affair, there's a responsibility to consider the consequences of their actions. However, the author didn't intentionally deceive anyone; they were deceived by the man. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were consensual and based on the man's own deception. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing him. The main wrongdoer here is the married man who cheated and hid his sexuality. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
