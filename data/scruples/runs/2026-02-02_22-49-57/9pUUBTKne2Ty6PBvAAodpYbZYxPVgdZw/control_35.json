I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation involves a married man who's having affairs, including with the author. He's in the closet, so revealing the infidelity would also reveal his sexuality.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with this man, which was consensual. The key issue is whether the author is obligated to tell his wife about the cheating. On one hand, the wife has a right to know she's being cheated on. On the other hand, exposing this would out him, potentially causing family issues and emotional harm.\n\nThe author is in a dilemma between two moral obligations: protecting someone's privacy versus upholding a spouse's right to know. The author isn't the one who cheated; they're a third party. However, by being involved in the affair, they might share some responsibility. But the main question is about whether they're in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the man.\n\nSome might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they have a moral duty to the wronged spouse. Others might say the author shouldn't interfere in someone else's marriage, especially when it involves outing someone. The author could also seek a way to inform the wife without outing him, like through a letter or anonymous means, but that's speculative.\n\nThe author's actions so far were consensual, but the dilemma is about whether to report the cheating. The answer hinges on whether the obligation to the spouse outweighs the obligation to the individual's privacy. In this context, the author isn't the primary wrongdoer here. The cheating husband is the one at fault. The author's choice to inform the wife is a difficult one but not necessarily wrong, given the wife's right to know. However, the act of outing someone in the process complicates it. But since the author is a third party, their moral standing isn't clear-cut. They could be justified in wanting to protect the wife, hence not being in the wrong. But if the author is part of the infidelity, maybe they have some accountability.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to do the right thing by the wronged spouse, even though it's a tough situation. However, there's a nuance here because the author is also part of the affair. But the primary wrong is the husband's cheating, not the author's decision to inform the wife. So B seems likely.\n"
