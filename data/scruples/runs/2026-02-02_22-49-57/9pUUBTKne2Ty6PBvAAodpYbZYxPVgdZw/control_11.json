I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would out him as gay. The situation is complex, so I need to analyze the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had an affair with a man who is married and has kids. The man is in the closet and asked the author to keep their relationship secret. The author is now conflicted about whether to tell the wife about the cheating, which would out him. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are the affair itself and the potential exposure. The author was involved in a series of sexual relationships with a married man, which is cheating. That's a personal choice, but it's part of the context. Now, the author wants to inform the wife, which would mean outing the man as gay. But the man might be a cheater, and the wife has a right to know about the infidelity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's initial actions (cheating) are part of the problem. But the main question is about the current decision to expose. If the author decides to tell the wife, even if it out the man, is that wrong? The user is asking if the author would be in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of the reason the man is in this situation. By having an affair, the author contributed to the infidelity. So, the author might be in a position where they have less moral ground to act as a whistleblower. On the other hand, the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on, and the man's closeted status complicates things because outing him could cause family issues.\n\nBut the author is not a third party; they were directly involved. The author's motivation might be mixed. They might feel guilt from their own actions and want to \"do the right thing\" by telling the wife, but their role in the situation complicates that. The man is cheating, which is wrong, but the author's own actions are also ethically questionable.\n\nAdditionally, the author might not be the only person the man cheated with, as he has a Grindr account. So, the author's disclosure could be one of many. However, the author's decision to out him might not be the right approach, given the potential harm to both the man's family and his personal situation.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action. Since the author was complicit in the cheating, they might not be in the right to decide to out the man. The author's own actions were a violation of the man's marriage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they were part of the infidelity and now are considering a harmful action without being a neutral third party. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
