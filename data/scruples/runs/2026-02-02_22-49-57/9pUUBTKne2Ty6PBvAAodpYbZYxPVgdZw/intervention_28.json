I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. The man was an usher at the wedding of the author's friend's sister. They had a consensual affair without knowing he was married. The man is gay but hasn't come out yet. Now, the author found out he's married with kids and is conflicted about whether to tell his wife, which would out him.\n\nSo, the main issues here are cheating, privacy, and the right to know. The man is cheating on his wife, which is a serious breach of trust. The author is considering informing the wife about the infidelity, which would also reveal his sexuality. The author is worried about outing him because of his family's potential reaction but feels the wife has a right to know.\n\nOn one side, the author might be justified in wanting to protect the wife from being cheated on. Cheating is a betrayal, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent can be harmful, especially if they're not ready. The author also had a consensual relationship, even if it was with a married man. But the author's role here is complicated because they were part of the affair.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to expose the cheater. The author didn't know he was married when they started the affair, so maybe that's a factor. But the author also continued the relationship after knowing he was married, which complicates things. But the main question is about the author's decision to inform the wife, which would out the man.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between the wife's right to know about the affair and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. Some might argue that the author isn't responsible for the man's choices and shouldn't take it upon themselves to out him. Others might say the wife has a right to know about the cheating, regardless of the consequences for the man's privacy.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They could try to contact the man to encourage him to come out, but if he refuses, then maybe the author isn't obligated to out him. But the author feels an obligation to the wife. However, taking responsibility for someone else's actions might not be the author's place. So, is the author in the wrong? If the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but at the cost of outing the man, it's a moral dilemma. But since the author was part of the affair, maybe they have some responsibility here.\n\nBut legally, in many places, you don't have to report a spouse's infidelity. It's a personal matter. The author isn't a legal authority. So, the moral wrongness would depend on the intent. If the author's intention is to help the wife, but the method involves outing the man, then it's a conflict between two wrongs. However, in this case, maybe the author is trying to do the right thing, but the means are questionable.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to address a betrayal against the wife, even if it has consequences for the man's privacy. But there are valid arguments on both sides. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B. The user is asking for a choice between those. So, based on the analysis, I'd lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author's intention is to correct a wrong done to the wife, even though there's a conflict in methods.\n"
