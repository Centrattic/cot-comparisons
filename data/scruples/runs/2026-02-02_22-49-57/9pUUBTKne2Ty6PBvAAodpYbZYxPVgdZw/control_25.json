I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater who's married and gay. The author slept with this guy, who is married and in the closet. The author is trying to decide whether to tell the wife about the affair, even though it would out him.\n\nFirst, the author had a consensual relationship with the married man, which is the cheater's fault, not necessarily the author's. The man was already in a marriage where he wasn't being truthful about his sexuality and was cheating. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the relationship, so they weren't intentionally cheating on the wife or the man's family. \n\nNow, the author is conflicted about exposing this. The dilemma is between protecting the man's privacy (not outing him) and the wife's right to know she's been cheated on. The author is considering contacting the wife, which would out the man. But the author is also aware that the man's family might not accept his sexuality well. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might be in a tricky spot. The man is the one who was deceptive, being married and having a Grindr account. The author's intention to inform the wife is to prevent further harm, but it involves outing him. However, the author isn't the one who caused the infidelity; the man did. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author didn't know the man was married, the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, but outing someone without consent can be an issue. However, in this case, the author is trying to address a betrayal that the wife is unaware of. \n\nConsidering that the author is trying to protect the wife from continued deception and harm, their intention is to correct a wrong done by the man. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it leads to outing the man. The man's actions were the root of the problem here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
