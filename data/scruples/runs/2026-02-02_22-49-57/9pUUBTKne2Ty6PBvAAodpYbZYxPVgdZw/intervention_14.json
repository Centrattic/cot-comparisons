I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The question is whether exposing the cheater (who is gay and closeted) by telling his wife would make the author wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. He's cheating on his wife, and the author found out about his marriage and children. The author is torn between exposing him (which would out him as gay) and not doing so to protect his privacy and family.\n\nThe key points here are: the man is cheating, the author is considering telling the wife, but outing him in the process. The author is conflicted because they respect his desire to stay closeted, but also feel the wife has a right to know about the infidelity.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation. \n\nMoral dilemmas like this are complex. On one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. On the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without their consent can be harmful, especially if the person's family is not accepting. The author is trying to protect the man from potential family trauma, which shows some consideration. However, the wife is being wronged by the husband's actions, so not informing her could be seen as complicit in the cheating.\n\nBut the act of outing someone's sexuality to their spouse to reveal infidelity might be a way to protect the wife without explicitly outing the man. However, in this case, it's likely that the spouse would realize the man is gay if she finds out about the relationship with the author. So, the act of telling the wife about the infidelity inherently involves outing him, which he might not be ready for.\n\nThe author is in a tricky spot. The options are between exposing the cheating (which out him) or staying silent. Legally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, the wife deserves to know. However, the author isn't legally obligated to report it. Morally, it's a different story. The author's responsibility here is to the wife, but they also have a promise to the man about not outing him. Breaking that promise could be seen as wrong, but the wife's right to know might override that.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, if they choose to tell the wife, they might be protecting the wife from further harm but at the cost of the man's privacy. However, the man is already cheating, which is a betrayal to his wife. If the author is in the wrong, it might be because they broke their promise, but if they're right, it's because they're protecting the wife. The answer depends on the balance between these two.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they choose to expose the cheater by telling the wife, which out him, are they wrong? The answer is likely B (No), because the author is trying to do the right thing by informing the wife about the cheating, even though it means outing him. The author's intention is to prevent further harm, which is a moral obligation. However, the complexity is that the wife's right to know versus the man's right to privacy. But since the man is already violating his marriage, the author's action might be justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
