I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author having an affair with a married man who is also in the closet about being gay. The author is considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him to his family, and is torn between the wife's right to know and not wanting to out him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who's married and in the closet. They knew he was gay but didn't know he was married until later. The question is whether they're in the wrong for considering to tell the wife. \n\nStarting with their actions: They had multiple affairs with a married man. That's cheating, so they're at least partially in the wrong for participating in an affair. However, the man himself is the one who's cheating by being married and having a relationship. So both parties are at fault here.\n\nNow, the author is considering exposing the man's infidelity to his wife. The man is in the closet, and his parents aren't supportive of being gay. So, telling the wife would out him, which could lead to family problems. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but is also aware of the potential harm to the man's family.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to expose him. If the man's wife has a right to know about the infidelity, but the author's method of informing her would also reveal his sexuality, which could cause additional harm. The author is trying to balance the wife's rights against the man's privacy and the potential family impact.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is the one who had the affair, so they're complicit in the cheating. However, the main ethical issue is whether they should inform the wife. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, which is understandable, but the method might harm the man's family. However, the man himself is the one who's wronged the wife significantly by cheating and hiding his sexuality. \n\nSo, the author is not entirely in the wrong because they're trying to notify someone who's been wronged. But they should consider if there's a way to inform the wife without outing him, or maybe find a third party to do so. The author's intention is to right a wrong, even though they were part of the initial wrongdoing by having the affair. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their intent is to help the wife, even if the method is complicated. But there's a nuance here. However, since they're asking if they're in the wrong in general, considering their actions and intentions, the answer might be B. But if the act of exposing him without his consent is considered wrong, even for a good reason, then maybe A. But the dilemma is more about whether they should do it, not whether they're in the wrong for considering it. Since the author is the one who was in the affair, they're not the only one at fault, but the question is about their current action of exposing him. The answer is likely B because they're trying to inform someone who's been cheated on, which is a valid concern, even if the method is tricky.\n"
