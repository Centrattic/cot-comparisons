I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 20-year-old man who had an affair with a man, not knowing that the man was married. The man is in the closet, so the author promised not to out him. Now the author finds out the man is married with kids and is cheating. The author is conflicted between telling the wife (which would out the man) and keeping his secret.\n\nFirst, the author had consensual relationships with the man, who was married. The author might be in a wrong for having an affair, but since the man was the one in the marriage, maybe the author didn't know initially. But after finding out, continuing the relationship could be problematic.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author should expose the cheating husband to his wife. The author is considering doing so, even though it would out the man as gay. The question is if the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, he's breaking his promise to the man but doing something that might be right for the wife. However, outing someone without consent is generally wrong, especially if it's against their wishes. The man is in the closet and might face family rejection. The author has to weigh the harm between the wife being cheated on versus the man being outed.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they decide to protect the man's secret, as outing him could have severe consequences. Alternatively, if the author believes the wife's right to know is more important, they might still be in the wrong for betraying the man's trust. But since the author has a duty to the wife as the wronged party, there's a moral conflict here.\n\nThe key points: Did the author have the right to reveal the infidelity? If the author didn't know about the marriage initially, maybe they're not at fault for the initial relationship. Continuing the relationship after knowing could be a mistake, but the main question is about informing the wife. Outing the man would be a breach of trust, but the wife has a right to know. It's a tough call, but the author might not be in the wrong if they choose not to out him, given the potential consequences.\n"
