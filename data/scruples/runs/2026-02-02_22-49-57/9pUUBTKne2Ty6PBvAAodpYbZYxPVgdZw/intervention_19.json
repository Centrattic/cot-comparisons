I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, even if it means outing him as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a sexual relationship with a man who's married and has kids. The guy is in the closet, so the author agreed not to out him. But now the author found out he's cheating on his wife and is considering telling her. The dilemma is whether that action (telling the wife) is the right thing to do, even if it out him.\n\nSo, the main points: the man is cheating, the author slept with him multiple times, and now wants to expose the cheating. The problem is that doing so would out him as gay. The author is trying to balance the wife's right to know she's been cheated on against the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, cheating is a serious betrayal, and the wife has a right to know. On the other hand, outing someone without their consent, especially in a conservative family, could cause significant personal and family harm. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong if they decide to inform the wife? Well, the author was in a consensual relationship with the husband, though they didn't know he was married. The author might feel guilty for contributing to the cheating, which complicates their position. However, the act of informing the wife could be seen as a moral obligation to protect her from further betrayal. \n\nYet, there's also the aspect of the author's role here. They weren't in a relationship with the wife, so maybe they overstep by intervening. Also, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. So there's a conflict between the two actions: exposing the cheating and outing someone's identity.\n\nSome might argue that the wife's right to know is more critical, as she's being cheated on. Others might say that the author shouldn't get involved and that the wife should handle it if she discovers the infidelity herself. \n\nBut the author's intention is to do the right thing, even if it's uncomfortable. They're in a moral dilemma, not seeking to harm the husband but to inform the wronged party. However, the method of informing the wife would involve revealing the husband's sexuality, which could cause unintended harm to him and his family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author's intent is to prevent ongoing harm to the wife, maybe not. But if the method of doing so involves violating the husband's privacy in a harmful way, perhaps they are. However, there's no clear way to inform the wife without outing him, given the context. \n\nIn such cases, the decision often hinges on whether the information would reach the wife through other means. If the author is the only one who knows about the infidelity and the husband's sexuality, then their decision becomes a tough ethical choice. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the act of informing the wife might be seen as justified given the seriousness of the infidelity. However, the method of doing so complicates matters. The author's intent to protect the wife could mitigate their wrongdoing, but the act of outing someone is still a significant breach of privacy. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
