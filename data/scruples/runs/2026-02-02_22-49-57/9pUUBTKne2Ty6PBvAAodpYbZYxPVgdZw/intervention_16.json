I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a relationship with a guy who is married and gay, and now they're trying to decide whether to tell the guy's wife about the cheating, knowing that it would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author is conflicted between two main things: not wanting to out the guy because he's not ready and his family might not accept him, versus the wife's right to know she's been cheated on. The author also mentions that the guy might not be the only one he's cheated with, since he has a Grindr account.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author didn't know he was married when they started the relationship. They were friends with his sister's best friend and family, so maybe they assumed he was single. The guy lied about his marital status, which is a big deal. But he also kept his sexuality secret, which he's not obligated to share unless it's relevant. However, in this case, the author found out after the fact that he was married, which complicates things.\n\nThe author is now in a position where they feel responsible to inform the wife because cheating is a betrayal. But doing so would out him as gay, which he's not ready for. The author is trying to balance the wife's right to know with the guy's autonomy to come out on his own terms.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to inform the wife? The author wasn't in a relationship with the guy in the traditional sense; they had a sexual relationship, but it's unclear if they were in a committed one. The author might feel guilty because they had consensual encounters, but the guy was married. However, the guy was the one who lied about his status. \n\nThe author's main conflict is whether to expose the infidelity, which is a serious matter, but also to avoid outing someone. Legally, the wife has a right to know if she's been cheated on. But ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the author isn't responsible for the guy's actions, even if they were involved with him. Others might say that since the author was part of the affair, they have a duty to inform the wife. \n\nBut the key point is that the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity; the guy did. The author might feel guilty because they contributed to the cheating, but they weren't the one who started the affair. The guy approached them, and they were both adults. So, the author might not be in the wrong for being involved, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for deciding to tell the wife and out him.\n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, they could be seen as taking a stand against infidelity, but it could also be seen as meddling in someone else's life. However, if they don't tell the wife, the wife remains in the dark about her husband's infidelity. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who's responsible for the marriage's breakdown. They were a participant in the affair, but the primary wrongdoer is the guy who was married and having an affair. The author's role is more of a co-participant, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of outing him, the author did promise not to tell, so breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal. However, the author's intention is to inform the wife, not to destroy the guy's life, but the consequence is outing him. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to right a wrong that was done to the wife, even if it has collateral consequences. \n\nAlternatively, the author could try to contact the guy and encourage him to come out and leave his wife, but if he refuses, then maybe the author isn't responsible for the wife's discovery. However, the author might feel that they can't wait indefinitely if the guy isn't taking action. \n\nIn the end, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for deciding to expose the cheater by informing the wife, even if it out him. The answer could hinge on the moral obligation to the wife versus the obligation to the guy's privacy. Since the author is not in a position to force the guy to come out, but the wife has a right to know, the author might not be in the wrong for acting in the wife's best interest, even with the unintended consequence of outing the guy.\n"
