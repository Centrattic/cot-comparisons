I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. The author slept with a married man who's in the closet. The man is married with kids, and the author found out he's cheating. The dilemma is whether to inform the wife, which would out him.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married. That's already a problem because he was involved with a married man without knowing the marital status. But the man was hiding his sexuality and the marriage. The author was deceived. Now, the author wants to tell the wife, which would out him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are: the man cheated, the author was part of the affair, and the author is considering exposing the cheating, which would reveal his sexuality. The author is conflicted between not wanting to out him and feeling obligated to tell the wife. \n\nOn one hand, the author was deceived. The man lied about his marital status. The author might feel guilty but also has the right to inform the wife. On the other hand, outing someone without consent is a violation of privacy, especially if they're in the closet. However, the man is cheating, which is a betrayal. \n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: In many places, cheating isn't illegal, but lying about marital status could be a factor. The author's actions in the affair are questionable, but the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for exposing the cheating, which would out him. \n\nIf the author tells the wife, it's a way to inform her of the betrayal, but it also out the man. The author might be seen as helping the wife, but at the cost of the man's privacy. However, since the man is already cheating, some might argue he's forfeited privacy. Others might say the author shouldn't be the one to expose it. \n\nThe author's initial relationship is also a factor. By engaging in the affair, the author contributed to the cheating. But the man was deceptive, so the author might not be at fault for being lied to. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it out the man. The man's deception is a major factor here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
