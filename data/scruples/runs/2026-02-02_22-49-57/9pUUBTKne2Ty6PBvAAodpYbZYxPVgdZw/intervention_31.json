I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The author had a series of affairs with someone who is married and in the closet. Now, they're conflicted about exposing the cheating husband to his wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author was initially asked not to reveal any information about their relationship. They agreed not to out him. But then they found out he's married and cheating. So, the question is whether they're obligated to tell the wife, even if it means outing him.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel responsible because they were part of the cheating. However, they also didn't know he was married when they started the affair. The dilemma is between protecting his privacy (and family) versus the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nIf the author tells the wife, they're exposing the husband's infidelity, which is a betrayal. But outing him as gay could have serious consequences, especially if his family is not accepting. On the other hand, keeping silent allows the cheating to continue, which is also harmful to the wife.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and the impact of each action. The author didn't know about the marriage when they started the affair, so they weren't initially cheating on someone. Now, though, they are complicit. The question is whether they have a duty to the wife, who is the actual spouse, versus respecting the husband's privacy.\n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. However, the author is in a tricky position. They might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, as the wife has a right to know. But they also have to consider the consequences of outing someone who is not ready. Maybe there's a way to anonymously inform the wife without outing the husband. If the author does out him, they might be in the wrong for breaching confidentiality. But if they don't act, they might be enabling further cheating.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's intent is to protect the wife or respect the husband's privacy. Since the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I have to choose between A or B. Considering the author's initial commitment to not out him and the potential harm in outing, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intention is to prevent further harm to the wife, even if it's a tough choice. Alternatively, if the author is breaching the trust of the husband, maybe they are in the wrong. But since the husband cheated, the author's action could be seen as a necessary evil. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
