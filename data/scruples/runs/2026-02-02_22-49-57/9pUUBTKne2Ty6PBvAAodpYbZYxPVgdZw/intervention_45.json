I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a sexual relationship with someone who is married and gay, and the person is in the closet. The author found out about the marriage and the cheating, and now is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy and informing the wife.\n\nThe key points here are: trust issues because the man lied about his relationship status, the author's intent to expose him to the wife which would also out his sexuality, and the potential family backlash from the man's parents. Also, the author is considering the wife's right to know about the infidelity.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. In many places, adultery isn't a criminal offense anymore, but it's still a matter of personal ethics. However, the act of \"outing\" someone without their consent is a violation of their privacy. The author is in a dilemma between two wrongs: outing someone's sexuality which could cause harm, or allowing the wife to remain in a potentially harmful situation.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the author has the right to expose someone else's infidelity without their consent. The author had a consensual relationship with the man, who was married. The author might feel they have a duty to the wife to inform her of the cheating. However, in doing so, the author would be breaching the man's confidentiality regarding his sexuality. \n\nBut wait, the man is the one who cheated. The author's relationship was consensual, but the man was married. The author's actions might not be wrong because they were deceived by the man. However, the author is now considering exposing him, which could have serious consequences. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be complicit by continuing the relationship after finding out the man was married. But the man didn't disclose that initially. \n\nThe author's main conflict is between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. Legally, the author isn't obligated to report the cheating unless the wife is a victim of a crime, which varies by location. Ethically, it's more complex. \n\nIf the author exposes the man, they might be doing the right thing for the wife but doing a wrong to the man by outing him. However, if they don't, the wife remains in the dark. But the author isn't in a position to decide for both parties. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were deceived and are trying to make a difficult choice between two harmful outcomes. But they could be in the wrong if they breach confidentiality without good reason. However, since the man cheated, there's an argument that the wife should know. \n\nBut the act of outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the circumstances. So even if the author's intention is to inform the wife, the method of doing so by outing the man might be ethically problematic. \n\nIn the end, the author is in a tough spot. If they expose the cheating without outing him, maybe that's better. But if they have to out him to do so, that complicates things. The answer depends on weighing the harm to the man against the harm to the wife. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were deceived and trying to balance the rights of both parties, even if the method is problematic. The main issue is the man's deceit, not the author's intention to expose the truth. So the answer would be B.\n"
