I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a relationship with this guy, who is married and in the closet. The guy was cheating, and the author found out. Now the author is conflicted about whether to tell the wife.\n\nFirst, the author was initially okay with keeping the guy's secret because he was in the closet. But then, the author discovered the guy is married and cheating. The moral dilemma is whether to expose the cheating without outing him as gay. \n\nThe author's main concern is that telling the wife would out him, which could lead to family problems because his parents are not accepting. But the author also feels the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. \n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for considering exposing the cheating, even if it out the guy? Let's break it down. \n\nThe guy is cheating, which is wrong. The author had a relationship with him, which might be a separate issue. The author is now considering informing the wife, which would out him as gay. But the author is trying to balance the wife's right to know with the guy's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nOn one hand, cheating is a betrayal, and the wife deserves to know. On the other hand, outing someone can have serious consequences, especially if they're not ready. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, but the method could be tricky. However, the author's own actions (sleeping with a married man) might complicate things. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering the exposure. If the author is trying to do the right thing by helping the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the author's own role in the situation (participating in the affair) might mean they have a conflict of interest. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a duty to report cheating, but also a duty to respect someone's privacy. The author is trying to navigate both, but the act of informing the wife would require outing the guy, which complicates things. \n\nSo, depending on the perspective, the author might be trying to do the right thing but in a way that's ethically murky. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's intention is to prevent further harm to the wife, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the author's initial involvement in the affair could be seen as problematic. \n\nBut the main issue here is the act of exposing the cheater. If the author is the one who is responsible for the infidelity, then perhaps they are in a position where they should not be the one to expose it. But if the author is just a participant and wants to do the right thing, maybe not. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions are complex. They had an affair, found out it's cheating, and want to inform the wife. The act of informing the wife would out the guy. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their intent is malicious. Since the author seems to be trying to do the right thing despite their own involvement, maybe they are not in the wrong. But their involvement in the affair could be a factor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it means outing the guy. But this is a tough call because the author's own actions are questionable. However, the intent here is to prevent harm to the wife, so the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
