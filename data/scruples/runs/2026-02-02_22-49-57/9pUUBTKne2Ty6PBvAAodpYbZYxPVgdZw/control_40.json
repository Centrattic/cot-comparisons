I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had multiple affairs with a man who's married, and now they're considering exposing him to his wife, which would out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who was married without knowing. That's a problem because the married man was cheating. The author didn't know he was married, so maybe they're not entirely at fault there. But they did engage in a relationship, so maybe some responsibility there.\n\nThen, the author is considering telling the wife. The issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. The man is in the closet, and the author would out him by informing the wife. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, outing someone without their consent can be a violation of their privacy, especially if their family would react poorly.\n\nSo, the author's dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality. The author might feel obligated to tell the wife because of the cheating, but they also made a promise not to out him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author comes forward, they might be right in protecting the wife but wrong in outing the man. If they don't tell, they might be complicit in the cheating. But the author was also part of the affair. The key points are consent and the author's role in the situation. \n\nThe author is part of the problem by being involved in the affair. So, they might be in the wrong for participating, but the question is about exposing him. If the author tells the wife, it's a breach of the man's privacy, but it's also exposing a betrayal. However, the author's actions (the affair) contributed to the problem. \n\nConsidering that the author was in the situation without knowing the man was married, but once found out, they have to decide. The author's main issue is whether to expose him. Since the man is in the closet, outing him could have severe consequences, and the author might be crossing a line by doing so. The author's obligation to the wife versus the promise to the man. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's main wrong is in the affair or in the decision to expose. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong (the entire scenario), the fact that they had an affair with a married man (even if they didn't know) could make them partially at fault. However, the main question is about the exposure. If the author is asking if they're wrong for exposing, then the answer might be A (yes) because they broke the promise and outed him. But if the author isn't in the wrong for the affair but is conflicted about exposure, the answer might be B. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions in the affair and the possible exposure. If they decide to expose, that's a separate issue. But the question is about being in the wrong in the situation. Since the author was part of the affair, they are in the wrong in that aspect. However, the dilemma is about whether to expose. The answer is A (yes) because the author was in a relationship with a married person, which is wrong, and the exposure part is a moral dilemma but not necessarily making them wrong. Wait, the question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" So the overall situation. The author's actions (affair) are wrong, so the answer is A. But the question might be specifically about the exposure part. But according to the user's instruction, the answer should be A or B based on whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author was in a relationship with a married person, they are in the wrong. However, the user might be considering the exposure part. But the question is the overall situation. The answer is A.\n"
