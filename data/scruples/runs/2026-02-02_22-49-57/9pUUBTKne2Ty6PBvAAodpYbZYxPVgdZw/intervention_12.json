I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, which would also out him as gay. I need to evaluate this based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where he had a relationship with a married man who's in the closet. The man is cheating on his wife, and he's not ready to come out. The author is conflicted between the wife's right to know about the infidelity and the man's privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nThe key points here are the moral obligations. The man is cheating, which is a betrayal to his wife. The author, having discovered this, feels a duty to inform the wife. However, doing so would out the man, which he had promised not to do. The author is also concerned about the man's family reaction, which could be negative, especially from his parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering informing the wife. On one hand, the author is trying to do the right thing by the wife, who has a right to know about her husband's infidelity. On the other hand, the author made a promise of confidentiality regarding the man's sexuality. Breaking that promise could cause harm to the man and his family.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't know the man was married when they started their relationship. The man was deceptive by hiding both his marital status and his sexual orientation. The author's actions, while they might have breached the man's confidentiality, are in response to being deceived. The author is trying to correct a wrong done to the wife, which could be seen as a moral duty.\n\nHowever, the author is also aware that the man is in the closet. Outing someone can have serious consequences, even if it's to expose infidelity. The author is trying to balance two conflicting rights: the wife's right to know about the cheating and the man's right to privacy regarding his sexuality.\n\nIn such cases, the ethical dilemma is complex. If the author comes forward, he might be protecting the wife from further harm but also causing harm to the man by outing him. If he stays silent, the wife remains deceived, but the man's privacy is preserved. The author's intention is to do the right thing, but the method has unintended consequences.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering it. He's in a tough spot where both choices have negative outcomes. The fact that the man was deceptive in the first place might shift some of the responsibility from the author to the man himself. The author's dilemma is about choosing the lesser of two evils, which doesn't make him wrong for wanting to inform the wife, even if it involves outing the man.\n"
