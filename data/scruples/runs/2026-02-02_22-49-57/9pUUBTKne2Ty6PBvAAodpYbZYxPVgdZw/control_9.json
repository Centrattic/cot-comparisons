I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by considering exposing a cheater, which would also out the person as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who's married and gay, keeping it secret. The person (husband) cheated by sleeping with the author. Now the author is torn between exposing the husband (which would out him as gay) and protecting his privacy.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's consent and the author's obligation. The husband asked the author not to tell anyone, and the author initially respected that. However, the husband is cheating, which is a betrayal to his wife. The author is conflicted because telling the wife would involve outing him, which could hurt him and his family if they're conservative. \n\nBut the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. The author is trying to decide if it's right to break the husband's confidence to protect the wife. The author isn't the one who cheated; the husband did. The author's role is more about being a third party who was involved without the wife's knowledge.\n\nThe moral dilemma here is whether the duty to the wife (who's being cheated on) outweighs the privacy of the husband. If the author tells the wife, they might be protecting the wife's rights as a spouse, but it could out the husband. However, if the husband is cheating, he's already violating his marriage vows, which is a serious matter.\n\nSo, the author's primary wrong, if any, would be if they had a direct role in encouraging the cheating or if they were the one who violated the marriage. But in this case, the author is trying to report the cheating, which is a right a spouse has. However, the method of doing so without outing the husband directly might be tricky. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering exposing the infidelity. Since the author is not the cheater and is trying to inform the wronged party, it's more about the means. But the act of exposing without the husband's consent might be seen as a breach of confidentiality. But the wife has a right to know. So it's a tough call, but the author isn't the one in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing by the wife, even if it has consequences for the husband. The husband's actions were the initial wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
