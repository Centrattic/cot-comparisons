I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is involved in a secret relationship with a married man who's also in the closet about being gay. The author is now considering exposing the man's infidelity to his wife, which would also out him as gay, causing potential family issues.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had a sexual relationship with a married man. That's cheating, so the author is complicit in the marital infidelity. The man was already in a committed marriage, and the author knew he was married but still engaged in the affair. That's a problem because the author is now part of the cheating scenario. The man is the one who's wronged his wife by being unfaithful, but the author is also involved in that wrongdoing.\n\nNow, the author is contemplating telling the wife about the affair, which would reveal the husband's infidelity and his sexuality. The author might feel a moral obligation to inform the wife, but they also want to protect the man from being outed. However, the author's position is complicated because they were involved in the affair. They might argue it's about justice, but they themselves contributed to the problem by being part of the infidelity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's role in the infidelity and their current dilemma. Since the author was part of the cheating, they can't be in a completely moral position to take action against it. They might be trying to make up for their mistake by telling the wife, but the act of cheating itself is where the author is in the wrong. The author's initial decision to engage in the affair with a married man, especially one who is in the closet, is the main issue. Their subsequent dilemma about what to do now doesn't absolve them of being wrong for participating in the affair in the first place.\n\nAlso, the author's intention to expose the cheater might be seen as trying to do the right thing, but the fact remains that their involvement in the affair is unethical. The author's complicity in the cheating means they are at fault regardless of what they decide to do next. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they were part of the infidelity.\n"
