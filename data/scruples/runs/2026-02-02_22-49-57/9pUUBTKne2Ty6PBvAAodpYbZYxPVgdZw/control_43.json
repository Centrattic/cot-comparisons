I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who is married and gay, but in the closet. The author knew he was in the closet and promised not to out him. But now, the author is considering exposing the cheating because the husband is married and cheating on his wife. The dilemma is between the wife's right to know and the man's privacy about being gay.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They were involved in a relationship that the man was in while married, which is cheating. The author might be in the wrong for being part of the affair. But the main issue here is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing the man. \n\nOn one hand, the man is cheating, so the wife should know. But doing so would out him, which he's not ready for. The author is trying to balance these two things. The question is about the author's actions in this scenario. \n\nThe author is conflicted between the marriage and the man's sexuality. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author had an affair, which is problematic, but the bigger issue is whether they have the right to expose the cheater by outing him. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for being part of the infidelity first. But the main issue here is the decision to expose. Since the man is a cheater and the wife has a right to know, but the exposure would involve outing him. The author is trying to do the right thing by the wife but could harm the man's privacy. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's intent is to protect the wife's rights versus respecting the man's privacy. The author is in a moral dilemma where either choice has consequences. But the fact that they were involved in the affair is part of the problem. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for considering exposing. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, the author was part of the cheating, which is their fault. But the main question is the exposure. So, the answer would be B (No), but I need to consider if the exposure is justified. Since the author is trying to right a wrong by informing the wife, even though it out the man. So the author is not in the wrong for wanting to expose the cheater.\n"
