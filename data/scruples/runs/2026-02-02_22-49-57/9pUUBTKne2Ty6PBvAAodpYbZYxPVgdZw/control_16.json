I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering exposing a cheater, even if it means outing him as gay. The situation involves a complex web of relationships and moral dilemmas.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who is in the closet. They had multiple encounters, and the man asked not to be outed. Now, the author is conflicted because they want to inform the wife about the cheating but don't want to out him, especially considering his family's potential reaction.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality, the man's request not to be outed, and the ethical obligation to inform the wife. The author initially promised to keep the man's secret, which is important. Outing someone against their wishes is generally considered a violation of trust. However, the wife's right to know about infidelity is also significant.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between respecting the man's privacy and the wife's right to know. The man is cheating, which is morally wrong, but the author is now in a position where revealing this might involve outing him. The question is whether the author's intention to inform the wife makes them wrong, especially if it leads to outing the man.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one who cheated, so they might not be in the wrong. However, they did engage in a relationship with a married man, which is part of the problem. The main issue is whether they have a duty to the wife. But since the man's identity as the cheater is tied to his being gay, outing him complicates things. Ethically, people have the right to privacy, especially regarding their sexual orientation. The author's initial agreement not to out him could mean they're bound by that promise unless there's a higher obligation to the wife.\n\nHowever, the wife's right to know about infidelity is usually seen as a more immediate wrong. But in this case, the act of revealing the cheating is intertwined with outing the man. So, the author is caught between two ethical obligations. Depending on the perspective, if the author prioritizes the wife's right to know over the man's privacy, they might be justified. But if they breach the man's trust without considering alternatives, they might be in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't initiate the cheating but is now considering exposing it in a way that violates a prior promise, there's a case for them being in the wrong. However, the cheating itself is the man's fault, not the author's. The author's dilemma is about whether to act on their moral obligation, which is complex. The answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because the cheating is the man's fault, but the act of outing might still be problematic. However, the initial agreement to not out him might mean the author is breaching that trust, so maybe they are in the wrong. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't the one who cheated. Alternatively, if the author is breaching a trust they promised to keep, then A (Yes). It's tricky. I think the key is that the author isn't the one who cheated; the man is. The author's action of informing the wife, though problematic, might not make them wrong. So answer B.\n"
