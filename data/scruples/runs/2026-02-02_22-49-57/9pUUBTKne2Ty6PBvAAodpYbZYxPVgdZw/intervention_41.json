I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sleeping with someone who's married and then considering exposing the cheating to the spouse, which would also out him as gay.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a married man who was in the closet. The man was cheating, and the author found out. Now, the author is conflicted between protecting the man's privacy and informing the wife about the cheating. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is aware that the man is cheating, which is a betrayal to the wife. The author might feel a duty to inform the wife because she's being cheated on. On the other hand, outing someone's sexuality without their consent can be harmful, especially if the man's family is not accepting. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is trying to balance these two issues. The author didn't know the man was married when they started the affair, so they weren't intentionally setting up a cheating scenario. The author even tried to respect the man's privacy by not outing him initially. Now, the dilemma is whether to report the cheating, which would involve outing him. \n\nIs the author obligated to inform the wife? The wife has a right to know about the infidelity. However, by doing so, the author would be violating the man's privacy regarding his sexual orientation. It's a tough spot. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author decides to inform the wife, they might be seen as doing the right thing by the wife to know, but it's at the expense of the man's privacy. However, the author isn't directly responsible for the cheating; the man chose to deceive. The author's role in this is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, if the author doesn't inform the wife, they might be enabling the cheating. But again, the author isn't the one cheating. The man made his own choices. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to handle a difficult situation where there's no perfect solution. The decision to inform the wife or not is a moral dilemma with both pros and cons, but the author isn't the one who initiated the cheating. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
