I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with someone who's married and gay, and they cheated. The author knew the guy was in the closet and promised not to out him. Now they found out he's married and has kids. They want to tell the wife but don't want to out him.\n\nSo, the author is in a moral dilemma. On one hand, they're considering exposing the cheater to protect the wife, but that would out him. On the other, they promised not to out him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action.\n\nThe key points: The author was involved in an affair with a married man who's gay and in the closet. The author didn't know about the marriage initially. Now, they want to inform the wife but are conflicted about outing him. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to expose the cheater? Well, the author is considering telling the wife, which would break their promise not to out the guy. But the wife has a right to know she's been cheated on. However, outing someone's sexuality without their consent is generally seen as violating their privacy, even if the person is cheating. \n\nThe author might be in a tough spot because they're trying to do the right thing for the wife but at the cost of the guy's privacy. But since the author was complicit in the cheating (they had multiple affairs), they might have some responsibility here. However, the act of outing someone is a separate issue. \n\nLegally, cheating isn't a crime, but morally, the author's actions in the affair could be seen as wrong. However, the main question is about the author's current action of exposing the cheater. If they tell the wife, they might be doing the right thing for the wife but wronging the guy by outing him. But if they don't, they're letting the wife be unaware. It's a tough balance.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's initial decision to have an affair was wrong, but the current dilemma is about whether to expose the cheater. The author is trying to navigate between two wrongs. If the author decides to tell the wife, they're choosing to prioritize the wife's right to know over the guy's privacy. However, outing someone without consent is generally considered a violation. So, the author might be in the wrong if they proceed, because they're breaking their promise and outing him, even if it's to inform the wife. But if they don't act, they might be complicit in the cheating. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The answer isn't straightforward, but given the context, the author's intention to expose the cheater could be seen as wrong because it involves outing him against his wishes. However, the moral obligation to the wife complicates things. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to do the right thing, but their actions could still be problematic because of the outing aspect. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering this, the answer might be A (yes) because they broke their promise and are now causing harm by outing him. Alternatively, B (no) because they're trying to right a wrong by informing the wife. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the act of telling the wife (and thus outing him) is wrong. Since the author promised not to out him, going against that promise is wrong. So the answer would be A. But maybe the answer is B because they're trying to help the wife. It's a tough call. I think the correct answer is A, because the author broke their initial promise and is now outing someone, which is a breach of trust, even if the intention is to help the wife. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
