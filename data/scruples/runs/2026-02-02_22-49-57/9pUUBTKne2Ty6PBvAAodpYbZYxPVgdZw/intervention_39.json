I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that not everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. \n\nAll of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. \n\nI'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sexual relationship with someone who was married and gay. The person was in the closet, and the author agreed not to out him. But now the author found out the person is married and cheating. The author is conflicted between not outing the person (to protect his privacy and family) and telling the wife (because it's a betrayal and the wife has a right to know).\n\nFirst, the author didn't know the person was married when they started the relationship. They were both in a position where the married person was hiding both his sexuality and his infidelity. The author didn't have a reason to suspect he was married because the wife was out of the country. The author's intention was to keep the person's secret, as they were aware he was in the closet. Then, after finding out about the marriage, the author is trying to decide whether to expose the cheating, which would also out him as gay.\n\nThe key points here are consent and harm. The author didn't know they were cheating, so their participation wasn't based on deceit from them. The married person was the one hiding both his identity and his relationship status. The author's dilemma is between protecting someone's privacy (which they initially agreed to) and the woman's right to know she was cheated on. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The married person is the one who broke his marriage vows. The author's role is more of a victim in the sense that they were used without being told the full truth. However, the author was in a relationship with someone married, which complicates things. But since the author didn't know about the marriage initially, they might not be at fault. \n\nIf the author decides to tell the wife, it's a tough call. Outing someone can be harmful, especially if the family isn't accepting. But the wife has a right to know about the infidelity. Maybe there's a way to inform the wife without outing the husband immediately, like through a lawyer or anonymously. But the author might not have the right to expose the infidelity unless they can do it without violating the husband's privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author doesn't tell the wife, the wife remains unaware of the cheating. But the author might feel guilty for not acting. However, the author's initial agreement to keep the husband's secret complicates things. They might not be responsible for the wife's knowledge, especially since they were part of the cheating, albeit unknowingly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. They didn't have intent to harm the wife. They were deceived by the married person. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their actions. The main wrongdoer here is the married person for cheating and not being honest. The author's dilemma is a difficult ethical one, but they aren't the one who broke the vows. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
