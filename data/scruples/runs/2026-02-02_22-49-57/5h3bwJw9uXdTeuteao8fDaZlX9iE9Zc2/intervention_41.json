Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person went over to their girlfriend and had a condom ready. The girlfriend said she wanted to use hers instead, and when he tried to use his, she insisted she wouldn't go through with it unless they used hers. He then left, and now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate from both sides. The girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, possibly because she mentioned wanting kids soon. But why would she want to use hers? Maybe she's not on birth control and wants to make sure she's using her own method. Alternatively, maybe she's trying to control the situation, or there's an issue of trust or preference.\n\nThe author had his own condom, which he prepared. The girlfriend's insistence that they use hers led to a conflict. He left because she wouldn't let him use his. Now, the question is about right and wrong here. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the author was using his own, that's fine, but if the girlfriend wanted to use hers, maybe she has a reason. However, if they're both in a monogamous relationship and both are using their own condoms, that's redundant. Wait, but maybe the issue is that she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy. If she wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using birth control, so using her condom would prevent pregnancy, whereas his might not. But why would she need her own? Perhaps she's unsure about his STI status or wants to control the situation.\n\nBut the problem here is the conflict over condom use. In some cultures or relationships, there's an idea that the woman provides the condom if she's not on birth control. However, the man is also responsible for protection. If the woman is pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's asserting control, but if he refuses, does that make him wrong?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not using contraception. But using a condom would prevent pregnancy, so maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy for now. Wait, the user says she said she wants kids soon, but thought they'd just mess around and that would be it. So maybe she's confused. If she wants to get pregnant soon, then using a condom would prevent that. So why would she insist on using her own? That seems contradictory. Maybe she's trying to prevent pregnancy for now but mentioned wanting kids soon, which is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to ensure they use a condom, but she wants to use her own for some reason. Maybe she's concerned about STIs and wants to use her own. But if they're in a monogamous relationship, maybe the concern is less. However, if one has an STI, using a condom is important regardless. \n\nThe author left because he wasn't comfortable with using hers. But if the woman is pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not comfortable with his, or there's a trust issue. Alternatively, maybe she's trying to enforce control over the situation. \n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, both parties should agree on the method of protection. If she's refusing to use his condom and is making it a deal-breaker, that's her choice. But if he's uncomfortable with using hers, he has the right to leave. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers for his STI, then maybe she's concerned about his health. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If he came prepared with his own, and she insisted on hers, and he left, is that wrong? Or is she wrong for pressuring him to use hers? Also, the friend calling him an asshole complicates things. \n\nIf the girlfriend is trying to have both parties use their own condoms, that's unnecessary and redundant. So perhaps she's overstepping. On the other hand, if she's not on birth control and wants to prevent pregnancy, she might be trying to ensure that. \n\nBut given that he had his own and she wanted to use hers, maybe the conflict is unnecessary. If they were both using a condom, it's overkill. So maybe she's trying to assert control, and he's standing his ground. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if using a condom is important for protection, and he's prepared, then using his should be okay. If she's pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's not respecting his choice. Alternatively, if she's concerned about his STI, she might be trying to protect herself. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the girlfriend made it a deal-breaker, the author's choice to leave might be justified if he's not comfortable. However, if the situation is that she's trying to prevent pregnancy and he's not on birth control, then using her condom is necessary. But the timeline is confusing because she wants kids soon but is now using a condom. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he had his own, and using his is acceptable unless there's a specific reason she needs hers. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's being controlling. Alternatively, if she's not on birth control and wants to prevent pregnancy, using hers is necessary. \n\nBut the user's analysis says the author is not wrong. So perhaps the answer is B (No).\n"
