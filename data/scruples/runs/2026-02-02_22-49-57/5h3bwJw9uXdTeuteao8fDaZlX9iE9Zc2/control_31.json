Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is a guy who went over to his girlfriend, and they were planning to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought maybe they'd just \"mess around\" for a while, but she mentioned wanting kids soon, which makes me think she might not be on birth control or might be trying to conceive. But he wasn't sure and thought she was talking about maybe in a week or two. When she got persistent and said he couldn't have sex with her unless he used her condom, he felt scared and left. Then her friend called him an asshole for not just going along with it.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and communication. Using a condom is a personal choice and part of safe sex. If she insisted on using hers, he should have had a conversation to understand her reasons. Maybe she has preferences about brands, or perhaps she's not comfortable with his, or maybe there's another reason. However, he mentions she \"won\u2019t let me until we use one she had,\" which suggests she was insistent, even to the point of refusing sex unless he used hers. That might be a power dynamic here. \n\nBut the user left because he felt scared. Is that a valid reason? Well, if he felt pressured or uncomfortable, walking away is appropriate. However, the problem arises if he is the one who is supposed to be the safer partner. If he's using a condom, that's typically to protect both himself and her. If she's not on birth control, using her condom might be necessary for her protection. But if he's the one bringing his own, and she's refusing, maybe she isn't using protection for some reason. \n\nWait, the user says he thought she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe he thought she was okay with unprotected sex. But he had his own condom, which suggests he might have been more concerned about protection. If she is planning to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using any method, or maybe she's using her own method. If he was the one using his condom, and she's not on birth control, then using her condom would be necessary if she's not on protection. But if she is on birth control, maybe she was just using the condom as a backup. \n\nBut the user didn't clarify her reasons for insisting on her condom. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. If he didn't ask her why she wanted to use hers, then he might have been dismissive of her needs. For example, she might have a latex allergy and needed a different type, or she might be on birth control and just prefers her brand. By not using hers, he might have been ignoring her preferences or health considerations. \n\nOn the other hand, he was scared and left. If he felt pressured, then that's a red flag. Healthy relationships involve mutual consent and open communication. If she was being controlling or manipulative by making it a condition for having sex, then he was right to leave. But if her insistence was about safety or health, then he might be in the wrong for not cooperating. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that he thought she was talking about maybe in a week or two when she mentioned wanting kids soon. That might not be accurate. If she specifically said \"in 2 months,\" then maybe he misinterpreted her timeline. If she's planning to conceive, then using a condom would prevent pregnancy, so her insistence on using hers could be a way to ensure that they don't get her pregnant yet. But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, she might be trying to conceive now, which is conflicting with her statement about insisting on a condom. \n\nWait, the user says \"she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it.\" So he thought she was vague about the timeline, but she actually said \"soon, like in 2 months,\" which he might have taken as a specific time frame. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant in two months, but they were planning to have sex now, then using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So if she wanted to use her condom to prevent getting pregnant now, but he didn't want to, that's a conflict. However, if he's the one who brought his own condom, maybe he's not on board with her plan to get pregnant. \n\nBut here's the thing: in a relationship, both partners need to agree on contraception. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant in two months, but he's bringing a condom, that might mean he's not ready for pregnancy. If she's not using any method, then using a condom is necessary for him. But if she's using her own method, maybe she's not. The user's answer is that he left because he was scared, but if he's the one who's supposed to be using protection, and she's not, then not using hers might be his mistake. \n\nBut he didn't ask her why she wanted to use hers. If he's in a relationship, communication is key. He could have asked her the reason for insisting on hers. Maybe she had a specific reason, like her condom is better, or she's not using any other method. By not using hers, he might have been putting her at risk if she's not on birth control. However, if he's not on board with her desire to get pregnant in two months, then using his own condom is his way of protecting himself. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole is adding to the confusion. Maybe the friend misunderstood the situation. If the girlfriend was pressuring him to use hers to avoid using protection, then he's right to leave. But if she had a legitimate reason, like her brand is necessary for her health or her birth control isn't reliable, then not using hers could be a problem. \n\nThe user's actions: he brought his own condom, which shows he was thinking about protection, but she insisted on hers. He didn't use hers and left. If he's the one who's supposed to be more responsible about protection, then he's in the wrong for not using hers. But if he felt pressured and wasn't comfortable, then he was right. \n\nBut the key point is consent and mutual agreement. If she is pressuring him to have sex without her preferred protection, maybe she's not respecting his needs. However, if he's the one bringing his own, and she's the one who wants to use hers, perhaps there's a conflict in priorities. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user needs to have been honest about his reasons for bringing a condom. If he's against her plan to get pregnant in two months, then he should have communicated that. If she's pressuring him to forgo his protection, then he's not in the wrong for leaving. \n\nBut the way the user describes it, he thought she was talking about a future plan and didn't take her comment seriously. That's a problem because if he's not ready for pregnancy, he should have discussed it. If she's not on birth control and he's okay with getting her pregnant, then using her condom might not be necessary. \n\nHowever, the user's main point is that he felt scared by her persistence and left. If he felt coerced, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's just being stubborn and didn't want to use her condom for no good reason, that's different. \n\nSo, the answer depends on why he didn't use hers. If it's because he was okay with her getting pregnant and she's not, or if he was being inflexible, then he's in the wrong. If he was standing up for his own needs and felt pressured, then he's not. \n\nGiven that he mentions he was scared and her friend called him an asshole, maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate properly. The correct approach would have been to ask her why she wanted hers, and if it's about her health or protection, then use hers. But if he's not on board with her plan to get pregnant, he should have discussed it. \n\nTherefore, the user is in the wrong if he didn't communicate his stance on pregnancy and just left without understanding her reasons for using her own condom. But if he felt pressured and was respecting his own boundaries, then he's not. However, the fact that he brought his own and refused to use hers without a valid reason (like a medical one) might mean he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because in a relationship, both partners should discuss and agree on contraception. The guy brought his own, but when the girlfriend insisted on hers, he should have either used it or discussed why he brought his own. Instead, he left, which could have been a way to avoid a conversation, possibly ignoring her needs. The friend's reaction might be because the girlfriend was being controlling, but the user should have addressed it with her directly. Without clear communication, he's at fault for not using the agreed-upon method.\n"
