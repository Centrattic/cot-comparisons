Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom during a sexual encounter with a girlfriend they've been dating for a few weeks.\n\nFirst, the author brought their own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. The author refused, left the situation, and now is being criticized. The key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and safety.\n\nCondoms are a form of protection against STIs and unintended pregnancy. When one partner insists on using a specific condom, it's important to have a discussion about why. In this case, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control, making condoms necessary. But if she provided her own, maybe she wanted to ensure it's her choice of product.\n\nThe author had already brought their own, which could be seen as a good step in being prepared. However, the girlfriend's insistence on using hers might be about her control over the situation or concerns about the author's condom. If she's worried about STIs or pregnancy, using her own might be her way of ensuring safety. But if she's not using any protection, that's a different issue.\n\nThe critical factor here is mutual consent and communication. If the girlfriend made it a non-negotiable demand without discussing the reasons, that could be a red flag. However, the author also had the right to feel uncomfortable using someone else's condom without knowing its safety or if they were the right type. But in most cases, using a condom, regardless of whose it is, is better than not using one at all. \n\nBut wait, the author left because she wouldn't let them use theirs. So, in that case, the author chose not to proceed without mutual agreement on protection. That could be seen as respecting their own boundaries. However, if the girlfriend was pressuring them into using hers, maybe the author should have discussed it more instead of leaving. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent. Both parties need to agree on the terms of the encounter. The girlfriend's statement that the author might as well leave if they didn't use hers could be seen as ultimatums, which are not healthy. However, if the author is concerned about STIs and the girlfriend is not using any protection, then the author is in the right to insist on their own condom. \n\nWait, the author had a condom and was ready to use it. The girlfriend wanted to use hers. If the author is okay with using hers, then it's a matter of logistics. But if the author is concerned about the quality or safety of her condom, that's a valid reason to not use it. However, in most scenarios, using any condom is better than none. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's friend is calling the author an asshole. That might be an indication that the girlfriend's side is framing the author as the problem. But maybe the author is right in wanting to use their own. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should communicate about their needs and boundaries. The author's action of leaving might be a way of asserting their own boundaries, but it's also possible they could have negotiated more. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum (\"if not, leave\") is a strong move that might not be healthy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to leave when unable to reach an agreement on protection could be seen as prioritizing their own safety or boundaries. However, the girlfriend's insistence might have been about her own needs (like not wanting STIs or pregnancy). The author might not be in the wrong if they were prepared and willing to use a condom but had concerns about the other's. Ultimately, both need to communicate better, but leaving might not be wrong if the author felt the situation was unsafe.\n"
