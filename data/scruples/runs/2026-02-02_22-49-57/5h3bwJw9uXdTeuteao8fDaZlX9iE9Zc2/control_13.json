Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom.\n\nFirst, the author had brought his own condom. The girlfriend insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't. The author left because he wasn't comfortable with that. The key points here are consent and safety. \n\nUsing protection is important for both parties, but the issue here is about who provides it. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, maybe for reasons like STI prevention or because she had her own preferences. However, the author was okay with using a condom but didn't want to use hers. The girlfriend's reaction was confrontational, even making him leave and getting her friend involved. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own comfort. Safety is mutual responsibility. If the girlfriend had STIs, using her condom would be a risk. But if they're both clean and on the same page about starting a family, maybe she was just being controlling. \n\nThe author's refusal to use her condom isn't wrong because he shouldn't have to use a method he's not comfortable with. The girlfriend's approach was pushy. The author made a choice to leave rather than comply under pressure, which shows he respects his own boundaries. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
