Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted. The situation is that the guy brought his own condom, but the girl refused it and said they should use hers. He was hesitant and left, then got criticized by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. In a sexual situation, both partners should agree on the method of protection. The girl was insistent, even to the point of threatening to make him leave if he didn't use hers. But the guy was the one who brought a condom, maybe expecting to use it. The key point here is that the girl wanted to use her own, which could be for various reasons like STI protection, pregnancy, or personal preference. However, if the guy is not comfortable with that, he has the right to refuse.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply that she's not on birth control or might be open to pregnancy, but the guy might not be ready. The guy's hesitation could be about not wanting to use her condom, perhaps because he's concerned about her STI status or other reasons. However, the girl's insistence that he leave if he doesn't use hers raises a red flag. If someone is pressuring the other to a point where they feel coerced, that's a problem. Coercion isn't healthy in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy could have communicated his concerns more effectively. Maybe he should have discussed why he wanted to use his own condom instead of just refusing. Walking away might have been a good move to avoid a pressured situation, but the friend's reaction suggests there's more context they might be missing.\n\nThe main issue is mutual consent. If the girl was pressuring him to a point where he felt uncomfortable and he left, he's not in the wrong. However, if he was supposed to have a mutual decision and he unilaterally decided against hers, that could be an issue. But given the circumstances, since he didn't proceed and left, he might be in the right. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
