Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers because she wants to get pregnant soon. He didn't go through with it and left, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy. Using a condom is a personal choice, and both partners should agree on the method of protection. The guy brought his own, but she wanted to use hers. But why would she want to use hers if she's planning to get pregnant? Maybe she wanted to have a baby, but if they were using her condom, maybe she's not on birth control and wanted to track ovulation or something. Alternatively, maybe she wanted to use a specific type of condom, but that doesn't make sense if she's trying to get pregnant.\n\nWait, the story says she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not using any other form of birth control and needed to use her own condom for some reason? But if she's trying to conceive, why use a condom at all? That seems contradictory. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Maybe she wanted to use her own for a different reason, like she's more comfortable with her brand or there's a medical reason. But the guy is confused and doesn't know why she's being so insistent. \n\nThe guy says he thought she wanted to maybe \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it,\" but she's now pushing for her own condom. If she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she didn't want protection at all. But using her own condom would still prevent pregnancy. So maybe she didn't want him to use a condom, but he thought that was the case. Wait, the guy thought she wanted to maybe not use a condom but she ended up insisting on using hers. That's conflicting. \n\nThe guy says he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. But if she's trying to get pregnant, why would she need a condom? Maybe there's a mistake in communication. If she wanted to get pregnant, she shouldn't be using a condom. So perhaps she was trying to prevent pregnancy but the guy thought she wanted to get pregnant. That's a big misunderstanding. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy had the right to use his own condom, and she had the right to refuse. But if she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she actually wanted to have unprotected sex but the guy thought she wanted to use protection. If that's the case, the guy's refusal to use her condom might be because he wanted to use his own, but she wanted none. That's a miscommunication. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she wants to use her own for some other reason, like she's on birth control and wants to use her own for extra protection. But the story says she's trying to get pregnant, so that's conflicting. \n\nThe guy left and now her friend is upset. The guy is questioning if he was wrong. If he respected her decision by using her condom, maybe he should have. But if she's trying to get pregnant, using any condom would prevent that. So the confusion here is critical. If she wanted to get pregnant, using a condom is contradictory. Therefore, maybe she made a mistake in her communication, and the guy was confused. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have clear communication. The guy had the right to use his own condom unless she didn't want any. If she wanted to get pregnant, she shouldn't be using a condom. If the guy thought she wanted to use a condom but she actually didn't, that's a problem. But the story is unclear. \n\nThe guy's actions: he brought his own, she insisted on hers. He refused and left. Is he in the wrong? It depends on whether using her condom would align with her actual intentions. If she wanted to get pregnant, using any condom is contradictory. So maybe she actually wanted to have unprotected sex, and the guy's refusal to use her condom (if she wanted none) is the issue. But the story says she insisted on using hers, so maybe she wanted to use a condom but for different reasons. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she wanted to use her own because she had a specific type or was on birth control but wanted to double up. But the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, so that's confusing. \n\nThe key here is about consent and agreement on protection. The guy had the right to use his own, but if the woman wanted to use none, he should not have. But the story says she insisted on using hers, so maybe she wanted to use a condom but not his. If he's willing to use a condom, the brand shouldn't matter. Unless there's a reason she's against his. \n\nSo, if the guy is willing to use a condom, but the woman wants to use her own, he could have agreed to use hers. But he refused because he brought his own. That might be the wrong part. Because if both agree to use a condom, the brand is a minor detail. The guy's insistence on using his own might be unnecessary. \n\nIn that case, the guy is being rigid and not compromising. Therefore, he's in the wrong. But if there's a deeper issue where she actually wanted to not use a condom (to get pregnant), and the guy thought she wanted to use one, then the problem is her communication. However, the story states that she said \"no need, I have some,\" implying she wants to use a condom. But the guy thought she wanted to not use any. So there's a miscommunication. \n\nIf they couldn't agree, the right choice is to not proceed. But the guy left, and the question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom. If they can't reach an agreement, the safe choice is to not have sex. But the guy brought his own, she wanted hers, and he refused. If the guy is okay with using a condom, the brand shouldn't matter. So by not using hers, he's being inflexible. Therefore, he's in the wrong. \n\nBut if the woman was actually trying to get pregnant and didn't want to use a condom at all, then the guy should have used her condom only if that was the case. But since she's trying to get pregnant, using any condom would prevent that. Therefore, she might have made a mistake in her communication. \n\nThis is a bit of a tangled situation. The answer hinges on whether the woman actually wanted to use a condom or not. If she wanted to use a condom, the guy's refusal to use hers is wrong. If she wanted no condom, then the guy was right to not comply. But since she insisted on using hers, even though she mentioned wanting to get pregnant, there's a contradiction. \n\nGiven the information, the woman's insistence on using her condom contradicts her desire to have children soon. Therefore, she might have made a mistake in communication. However, the guy should have been more flexible and used her condom if that's what she wanted, unless she was against using any. \n\nSince the story is from the guy's perspective and he's confused, it's possible that he's not in the wrong if the woman's intentions were unclear. But if she clearly wanted to use her own condom, then the guy's refusal is the issue. \n\nIn most cases, using a condom is a shared responsibility, and the brand shouldn't matter. Therefore, the guy should have used her condom if that's what she wanted. Hence, he's in the wrong for not compromising.\n"
