Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy brought his own condom, but the girl refused to use it and insisted on hers. He mentioned that she wanted to have kids soon, but he thought they were just messing around for a couple weeks. He ended up not using any because she wouldn't let him use his own and got angry when he left. Now he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nSo, from a health perspective, using a condom is important for STI protection. If they're not in a monogamous relationship or not sure about each other's status, not using a condom could be risky. But the girl wanted to use hers, maybe because she prefers a specific brand or she's more comfortable with hers. But the guy was okay using his own. \n\nHowever, the girl made it a deal-breaker, saying he should leave if he didn't use hers. That seems controlling. The guy was scared and left, which might be a reaction to pressure. But he did bring his own, so he was prepared. If the girl wanted to use hers, maybe she could have compromised. \n\nAlso, the girl's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate that the girl's side is expecting him to just go along. But consent and mutual agreement are key here. If she was pressuring him to use her condom instead of his own, that could be a red flag. He should have the right to use his own protection. So, by leaving, maybe he was standing up for himself, but if they were planning to have unprotected sex because she wanted kids, maybe there's a misunderstanding about their intentions. \n\nBut the main issue is consent and respecting boundaries. If she was okay with not using a condom, but he wasn't, that's a problem. However, since he was prepared with a condom, not using it without his consent would be a violation of his boundaries. So, he might not be in the wrong for not using hers if he wasn't comfortable. \n\nWait, the story says he was scared because she was insistent. Maybe he was in the right to leave because she wasn't respecting his preparedness. Alternatively, if she was insistent on not using a condom, then he's in the right to not proceed. But the problem is he ended up not using any condom, which could be risky. \n\nBut the key here is that he was prepared, and she insisted on hers. If he was okay with using hers, he could have, but he wasn't. However, he was prepared with his own, so maybe he was trying to be responsible. If she refused to use his, but he wasn't willing to compromise, then leaving was his choice. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's about mutual consent. If she's pressuring him to not use his own condom, but he wants to use one, then he's in the right to leave. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
