Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The man brought his own condom, but the woman insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed if he used his own. The man was scared and left. Then the woman's friend called him an asshole. He's now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, key points here: The man had his own condom, which is responsible. The woman wanted to use hers, maybe because she's planning pregnancy soon. But why the insistence? If they're both comfortable and it's a mutual decision, using her condom isn't inherently wrong. However, she made it a deal-breaker, which might be a red flag. The man chose to leave instead of complying, which could be seen as standing up for himself, but if she was pressuring him, maybe he should have communicated better.\n\nWait, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon. If they're planning to conceive, why use a condom? Maybe they were trying to decide whether to use protection. But the man had his own, and she wanted to use hers. Maybe there's a power dynamic here. If she refused to use his, maybe there's an issue of control. Also, the friend calling him an asshole suggests maybe the woman didn't handle the situation well.\n\nFrom a consent perspective, both should agree on the terms. If she was pressuring him and he felt scared to the point of leaving, maybe he was right to leave. But if the issue was about using her condom, which is also safe, then maybe he overreacted. But he had his own, so why the insistence? Maybe she wanted to ensure it was her condom for some reason, like STI prevention. But if they're both in a monogamous relationship, maybe that's unnecessary. However, the man's action was to refuse her condom, which could be a problem if she has a valid reason.\n\nBut in general, bringing your own condom is responsible. If she wanted to use hers, but he's okay with that, it's fine. However, she made it a non-negotiable. The man's leaving could be seen as standing his ground, but if it was a mutual decision, he might have been in the wrong. But the text says she was persistent and made him leave. The man might have felt coerced into using his condom, so leaving was his choice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the man using his own condom is standard, but if the woman is okay with using hers, he should comply if they agree. However, if she's pressuring him without a good reason, maybe he's in the right. But since they were planning to have sex, and he had his own, maybe he should have respected her preference unless there's a health reason. But without more info, it's hard to say. The fact that the woman mentioned wanting kids might indicate she's not on birth control, so using a condom would prevent pregnancy. Wait, but if she wants kids soon, why use a condom? That's confusing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she wanted to use her own to track ovulation or something. But regardless, the man had his own, and she refused. The man left, which could be seen as standing up for himself. The woman's friend calling him an asshole might be biased. But the main question is whether the man is in the wrong. Since he had his own and she wanted hers, but he refused and left, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if using her condom was a mutual decision, he should have agreed. But if she was pressuring him, he might have been right to leave. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
