Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who were about to have sex, and the man brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter otherwise. The man then left, and now he's wondering if he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Condom use is a personal and health-related decision. The man had his own condom prepared, which he brought to ensure safe sex. The girlfriend, however, wanted to use hers. She was persistent and even made him leave if he didn't comply. \n\nNow, the main issue is about consent and mutual agreement on safety measures. In a relationship, both partners should ideally discuss and agree on such matters beforehand. However, in this case, the man had already brought his own condom, which he intended to use. The girlfriend's insistence on using hers could be seen as a red flag. Why would she need to use her own? Maybe she had her own reasons, like not wanting to use another person's condom for health reasons, or perhaps she had a preference for a specific type. But the problem is that she was pressuring him to use hers, even to the point of being confrontational.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's mention of wanting kids soon. If she wanted to conceive, then not using a condom would make sense. But the timeline she mentioned\u2014maybe a week or two of messing around and then trying to conceive\u2014seems conflicting. If she wants to use her own condom, that would prevent pregnancy. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps she was planning to use her own condoms for birth control, but then changed her mind, or there's a miscommunication about her fertility plans.\n\nThe man's decision to leave when she insisted on using her own could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries. He had prepared to use a condom for protection, and she was overriding that. Using a condom is a personal choice, and if one partner is insistent on using their own, that might be a sign of control or lack of trust. However, the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, as she made him leave and then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the man's action to leave might be justified if he felt that his safety and preparedness were being disregarded. He had a reason to use the condom he had, and her insistence could be seen as manipulating the situation. However, the girlfriend might have her own reasons, but the way she handled it was confrontational and possibly disrespectful. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent and respect. The man was prepared to use a condom for his own safety, and she was insisting on using hers. The man's choice to leave was his way of not compromising his own preparedness. The girlfriend's behavior of threatening to end the encounter and her friend's harsh reaction might indicate that the situation was not handled respectfully. \n\nTherefore, the man is not in the wrong. He had a right to use the condom he brought, especially if he was concerned about STIs or other health reasons. The girlfriend's insistence and the subsequent reactions from both her and her friend seem to be overreacting. The man's decision to leave was a valid choice to prioritize his own boundaries and safety. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
