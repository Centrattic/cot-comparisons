Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend. He brought his own, but she wanted to use hers. He refused and left. The friend called him an asshole. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules around consent and safe sex. Using a condom is a personal choice, and both partners should agree. If one partner insists on using a specific condom, the other has the right to refuse if they're uncomfortable. But maybe there's more to consider here.\n\nThe key points: He had his own condom, she wanted to use hers. He didn't want to use hers for some reason, maybe safety, expiration, or just preference. She made it a deal-breaker. He left. The friend is upset with him. The question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, consent is mutual. If she was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt it was against his comfort, he has the right to say no. However, if there's an agreement or understanding about safe sex, maybe he should have discussed it more. But in this case, he had his own, so using hers might not be necessary. But if she's not comfortable with his, maybe there's an issue of control. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but was pushing for no condom (since using hers would mean she's in control of the method?) Hmm, maybe not. If she wanted kids soon, using her own condom might be to prevent pregnancy? Or maybe she wanted to have sex without a condom? Wait, if she wanted kids, why use a condom at all? Maybe that's confusing. But the story says she wanted to use hers, so maybe she had her own reasons. \n\nBut the main point is that he had his own and she insisted on hers. He left. Is that wrong? Well, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If he was uncomfortable using hers, he had the right to leave. She should not pressure him to use a condom he didn't bring. So maybe he's not wrong. But maybe he should have discussed it more before getting to that point. But in the heat of the moment, leaving might have been the only option. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might be because she wanted to use her own for some reason. But if he's bringing his own, why use hers? Maybe trust issues? Or maybe he's supposed to trust her to provide it? Not sure. But in terms of right or wrong, if he's not in the wrong for not using hers, then the answer is B. So the answer is B.\n"
