Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where he brought his own condom to a sexual encounter, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. He was willing to use a condom, but she refused his and made it a deal-breaker. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know the consensus.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author came prepared with a condom, which is responsible. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, but he was okay with using his. She became insistent and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. He left, and now he's questioning his decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of consent and personal boundaries. The author was trying to protect himself by using a condom. If the girlfriend is insistent on using her own, maybe there's an issue with trust or control. However, the girlfriend's decision to not use his condom might be based on her own preferences, perhaps she has STI concerns or wants to ensure it's her own. But if she's pressuring him to not use his own, which he brought, that could be a red flag. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consent are crucial. The author stood by his decision to use a condom, which is a responsible choice. If the girlfriend is not okay with that, maybe there's a deeper issue. However, the girlfriend's insistence might be about her own comfort or health. But the author's choice to leave when she made it a deal-breaker could be seen as standing up for his boundaries. \n\nBut then, if the girlfriend is the one who has mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's on birth control, but maybe the author is concerned about STIs. If the girlfriend is pressuring him not to use his own condom, maybe she's not being transparent about her health status. The author's refusal could be a matter of self-protection. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is uncomfortable using her own condom, maybe there's an issue with the situation. But the author's actions were to protect himself. So in this case, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
