Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The guy went over to his girlfriend's place, brought his own condom, but she refused to use it and wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, she said no, and she made it a deal where he had to use hers or leave. He left and got a friend's text calling him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. From a general standpoint, when it comes to sexual health and safety, the person who is bringing up the need for a condom is usually the one who is taking responsibility for their own safety. If the woman is asserting that they need to use her condom, maybe she's concerned about STIs or pregnancy, but the guy was bringing his own. However, the key point here is consent and mutual agreement. If she's insistent and he backs down, maybe he's respecting her boundaries. But if she's pressuring him to use hers for other reasons, that's different.\n\nWait, the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but thought they might just \"mess around for a week or two.\" Maybe she's trying to conceive but isn't ready yet. If she wants to use her own condom to avoid pregnancy, but the guy is okay with using his, then he's not being unsafe. However, in some situations, using a condom is a mutual decision. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, perhaps she's trying to control the situation. \n\nBut the author says he was scared and left. He might have felt pressured, but if she was insistent, maybe he was respecting her wishes. However, bringing his own condom and then not using it could be an issue if she's not on birth control or if there's a risk factor. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of consent, if she refused to proceed unless he used hers, and he left, then he was respecting her boundaries. But if she's pressuring him to use hers for a reason that he's uncomfortable with (like maybe she's not on birth control and they're not trying for pregnancy yet), then he's in the right. Alternatively, if she's not on any protection and insists on using hers, but he brings his own, maybe she's manipulating the situation. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people have preferences about whose condom is used. If a man brings his own and the woman insists on hers, it could be about control or safety. If she's the one who has to deal with potential pregnancy, maybe she's being more cautious. But the guy might be trying to take responsibility by bringing his own. However, if she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, using hers would make sense. \n\nIn terms of the text from her friend calling him an asshole, maybe the friend thinks he was being controlling by not using hers. But the guy left, which shows he wasn't forcing it. However, if she's the one who wanted to use her own, maybe he should have gone along. \n\nWait, but if the woman is the one who is supposed to be on birth control, maybe she's not, and by using her own condom, she's trying to prevent pregnancy. If he's okay with using a condom, but she wants to use hers, then he's not being unsafe. But if he's insistent on using his own, maybe he's being dismissive of her needs. \n\nBut in this case, the guy tried to use his own, she said no, and he left. So he didn't push back; he respected her refusal. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, and he's okay with that, he should go along. However, if he's uncomfortable with that for some reason (maybe he prefers his brand, or has a health issue), then it's a mutual decision. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether he is in the wrong for not using his own condom when she insisted on hers. If he left rather than using hers, maybe that's respecting her autonomy. Alternatively, if he had used his own and she still refused, that could be a problem. Wait, he started to unwrap his own, but she said no and made him use hers. He didn't use his own, but she didn't let him proceed unless he used hers. So he left. So he didn't end up using any condom. But the text mentions that he was scared, so maybe he left out of fear of not being able to proceed. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If she's the one who is insistent on using hers, and he left because he wasn't okay with that, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the issue is that he had his own and she wanted to use hers, perhaps the correct approach is to use hers if she's the one who wants to. But in this case, he tried to use his own and she wouldn't let him. So he left. \n\nI think the key points are mutual consent and safety. If she's the one who wants to use her own condom, and he's okay with using a condom but not hers, then he's being a bit controlling. But in this scenario, she's the one who is more insistent. Since he left and didn't push the issue, perhaps he's respecting her boundaries, so he's not in the wrong. However, if the problem is that he didn't use a condom at all (because he left), then that's a different issue. But he left, so no sexual activity happened. \n\nSo the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. He tried to use a condom, she refused, he left. He didn't force it. The pressure was on his side to use his own, but she was asserting her own wishes. If he left, he's not in the wrong. The friend's text calling him an asshole might be from the friend not understanding the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
