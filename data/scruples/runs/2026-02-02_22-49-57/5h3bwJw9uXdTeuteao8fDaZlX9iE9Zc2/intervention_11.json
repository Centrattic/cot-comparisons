Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the guy brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers, even to the point of refusing if he didn't. The guy then left, and now he's being criticized by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. The guy had his own condom, which he was ready to use. The girl is refusing to use his and insisting on hers. But why? Maybe she has specific reasons, like STI concerns or preferring her own. However, the guy is in a position where he's bringing up his own, which is a responsible action. \n\nWait, if the girl is the one who suggested using hers, is there a problem with that? Maybe she has a valid reason, like not trusting his condom or her own health reasons. But the guy is following through with his own. The key point here is mutual consent on which condom to use. If she's pressuring him to use hers instead of his own, is that a problem? Or is it about respecting each other's preferences?\n\nAlso, the girl mentioned wanting to get pregnant soon. If they're using a condom, that's for preventing pregnancy. But if she wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not on the pill or using another method, so using a condom might not be necessary if they're planning to conceive. Wait, that might be a red flag. If she wants to get pregnant soon, why is she using a condom? Maybe she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy for now, but that's conflicting with her statement. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nThe guy was prepared, but the girl is pushing for her own. If he's okay with using hers, that's fine, but he's not. The guy is in a situation where he's uncomfortable with her demand. If he's not in a position to accept that, then leaving might be a good choice. But maybe the issue is that he was inconsiderate of her wishes. \n\nAnother angle: the guy had his own, so he's responsible. If she's okay with using his, then why push her own? Maybe she wants to use a specific type, but the guy is set on using his. But forcing him to use hers could be a problem. Consent isn't just about yes or no, but also about mutual agreement on the terms. So if she's pressuring him to use hers when he's okay with his, that's a problem. \n\nWait, but the guy is the one who brought up his own. If she's okay with using his, then they should proceed. But she's not, and instead is making it a deal-breaker. The guy leaves, which shows he's respecting his own boundaries. But the friend is calling him an asshole, which is confusing. The guy's actions seem to be standing by his own preparedness. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy is not wrong for using his own condom. The girl is in a position where she's not respecting his preparedness. However, if she has a valid reason for using hers, that's another matter. But the situation is that she's making it a condition, which could be a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy isn't in the wrong for not using her condom. He was prepared, and she's the one changing the terms. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
