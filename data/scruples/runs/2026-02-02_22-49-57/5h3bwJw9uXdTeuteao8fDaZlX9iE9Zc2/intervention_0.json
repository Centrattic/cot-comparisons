Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. When he refused, she told him to leave, and now he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which is important because using a condom is a method of birth control. But the author had his own condom ready, which he brought with the intention of using it. The girlfriend's insistence on using hers might be about control or other reasons. The author was scared and left when she wouldn't let him use his own, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to analyze. From a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. The author had his own, which is good, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. However, if she's the one who is trying to conceive, maybe she's on birth control, but that's not certain. However, the key issue here is consent and mutual agreement on protection methods.\n\nIf the author was uncomfortable with using her condom, he has the right to set boundaries. Forcing someone to use a specific protection method can be a red flag. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014telling him to leave\u2014seems extreme, and her friend's judgment is adding pressure. The author respected his own boundaries and chose not to proceed without mutual agreement, which is healthy behavior.\n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend had valid reasons. If she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she's not on birth control and relies on condoms. If he used his own condom, it would prevent pregnancy, but if she wants to conceive, maybe she wanted to not use a condom. However, in this case, the author had already brought his own, so he might not have been aware of her intentions. Alternatively, maybe she's using condoms for other reasons, like STI prevention, but the author's refusal to use hers might not be the issue if both are using protection.\n\nBut the main point is that both parties should agree on the method of protection. The author had the right to bring his own, and if the girlfriend refused to let him use it, that's a problem. Forcing someone to use a different method without consent isn't okay. So the author's choice to leave when she wouldn't compromise shows he respected his own boundaries, which is the right thing to do. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
