Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom instead of his own.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author went over to his girlfriend, who he's been talking to for a few weeks. He had a condom prepared, but she insisted on using hers, even to the point of refusing to proceed if he didn't. He mentions she wanted kids soon but the author thought they were just going to \"mess around.\" The author didn't use his own condom and ended up leaving. Then the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't wrong, but they're unsure. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he came prepared with a condom. Maybe he felt it was safer to use his own, especially if he's not sure about her STI status. Insisting on using one's own condom is a common practice for personal safety. Also, the girlfriend's demand to use hers might be about control or her own preferences, but if the author feels uncomfortable, he has the right to set boundaries. Walking away in that situation could be seen as responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have valid reasons for preferring her own condoms. Maybe she's used to them, or she has specific preferences. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers in a way that makes him uncomfortable, especially if there's a risk involved, that's an issue. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then insisted on using a condom complicates things. If she's not ready for pregnancy, using a condom makes sense, but if she's using it as a way to control the situation, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle: consent and mutual agreement. Both parties should agree on contraceptive methods. If she's refusing to use his condom and he's not comfortable with hers, there's a lack of mutual agreement. The author might be right to walk away if he's not comfortable. However, if the situation escalates to her friend calling him an asshole, maybe he should have communicated better or considered her perspective more.\n\nBut the key point here is about who is in the wrong. The author didn't force her to use his condom against her will. He offered, she refused, and he respected her boundary by leaving. Insisting on using one's own condom is about personal safety, and walking away is a valid choice. The girlfriend's friend's reaction might be over the top, but the author's actions seem reasonable in protecting his own health and comfort.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He made a choice based on personal boundaries and safety, which is acceptable. The girlfriend's friend's judgment doesn't change that.\n"
