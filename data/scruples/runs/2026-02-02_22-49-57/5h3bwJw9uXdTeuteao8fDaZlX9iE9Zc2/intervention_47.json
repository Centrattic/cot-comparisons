Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend not wanting to use his condom and insisting on using hers. The writer didn't want to, so he left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Condoms are about safe sex, and both partners should agree on their use. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, maybe because she prefers her brand, or maybe there's another reason. The writer had his own and didn't want to switch. But he left when she refused. Did he do the right thing?\n\nWait, the key here is that the woman was insistent and even made him leave if he didn't use hers. The writer had his own, which is good, but she wanted hers. Now, in terms of responsibility, using a condom is a mutual decision. If one partner is uncomfortable using the other's, that's a red flag. It's important that both feel safe and trusted. However, sometimes people have preferences about whose condom they use, which might be about control or past experiences. \n\nBut in this case, the man didn't force her, he just wanted to use his own. However, the woman was so firm that she made him leave. The man left, so he didn't push further. Maybe the woman's insistence was about her not wanting to get pregnant, given she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe using her condom gives her more control over birth control. \n\nBut if the man had his own, maybe he should have been flexible. However, if someone is uncomfortable using another's condom, it's a personal choice. The man could have compromised by using her condom if he trusted her, but he didn't. His choice to leave was his right. However, the fact that the friend called him an asshole complicates things. Maybe the woman's friend thinks it's trivial, but the man is now doubting himself.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, if both have valid reasons, but the man left without forcing the issue, he might not be wrong. But if using a condom is a mutual decision, and he had his own, not using it could be seen as not respecting her decision. Wait, no, she was the one insisting on hers. So he was trying to use his own, which is fine unless she has a health reason. If she's using her condoms for her own reasons (like STI prevention, or birth control), not using hers could be risky. But if he had his own, maybe she's being controlling. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether using a condom is a mutual agreement. If the woman is insistent, and he's not willing to comply, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's not comfortable using her condom, perhaps due to distrust, then he's right to leave. However, the fact that he was prepared with his own suggests he wanted to be safe, and she's asking to use hers. If she's not on birth control and needs the condom for pregnancy prevention, then not using hers might risk her plans. But if he's okay with that, maybe it's her issue. \n\nI think the key is mutual consent. If she refused to proceed without using her condom, and he left, he's not forcing the issue. If he had his own and she's choosing hers, maybe he should have respected her choice. However, if he's uncomfortable with that, leaving is better than compromising. So maybe he's not in the wrong.
