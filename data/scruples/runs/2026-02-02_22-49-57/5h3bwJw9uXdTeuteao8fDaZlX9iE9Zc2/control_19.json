Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter but the woman insisted on using hers, even going as far as to tell him he should leave if he didn't. The guy then left, and her friend is now upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman mentioned she wants to have kids soon. If that's the case, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. Maybe she wanted to get pregnant and didn't want the condom, but the guy didn't know that. Alternatively, maybe she had her own reasons for preferring her condoms. However, the main issue here is consent and communication.\n\nThe guy brought his own condom, which is a responsible action. He tried to use it, but she refused and became persistent. The woman's insistence might be about control or her own desires. But if she's not comfortable with him using his condom, perhaps she was trying to exert control or there was a misunderstanding. However, in a consensual relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. If she wants to avoid pregnancy, she might prefer a specific brand or method, but the guy's refusal to use hers could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if she's already mentioned her plans for children. \n\nBut wait, the woman said she wouldn't let him unless he used hers. That's a significant point. If she's withholding consent to sex unless he uses her condom, that's a form of pressure. However, if she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, using her own condom might be part of that plan. The guy, on the other hand, might be uncomfortable with using someone else's condom for hygiene reasons or because it's a different brand. But since he brought his own, maybe he expected to use that. \n\nThe question is whether he was wrong for not using hers. If he's uncomfortable with her choice of condom, he has the right to refuse, but that could lead to the situation where he leaves. However, if she's pressuring him to use her condom to facilitate pregnancy, then he might have a right to object if he's not ready. Alternatively, if she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, using her condom is necessary. But the man's right to use his own method is also a factor. \n\nIn terms of consent dynamics, if she's withholding sex unless he complies, that's a form of coercion. But if he's leaving because he's not willing to comply, is that his right? It's a bit of a gray area. The fact that her friend is calling him an asshole complicates things. The man's actions might be seen as standing his ground if he doesn't want to use her condom, but maybe he should have discussed this more before the encounter instead of being rigid. \n\nAnother angle: if the woman is pressuring him to use her condom to get pregnant, but he's not ready for that, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's aware of her plans and still refuses to comply, maybe he is. However, since he didn't know her exact intentions (she mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just mess around), he might have been in a difficult position. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing his own condom shows he's prepared, but respecting her choice is also important. There's a balance between personal boundaries and respecting the partner's wishes. If he's uncomfortable with using her condom for any reason (hygiene, not trusting her, etc.), he's within his rights to refuse, but then he should not proceed if she's not allowing him to use his own. \n\nIn summary, the situation involves conflicting priorities. The man is not necessarily wrong for not using her condom if he had valid reasons, but the way he handled the situation (leaving abruptly) might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if she was pressuring him to use her condom to avoid pregnancy, then he might be wrong if he's not ready for that. But since he didn't know her exact intentions, it's more about his boundaries versus her expectations. The answer hinges on whether using her condom was a deal-breaker for him. If he's not comfortable, then he's not wrong, but if the issue was about her trying to get pregnant and he refused, that's a different matter. The story is a bit unclear, but based on the information given, the man's actions were a result of his own boundaries, so he might not be in the wrong. However, the woman's insistence might indicate her own issues. The answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong) because he stood by his own preparedness and left when she became coercive.\n"
