Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend (or a new partner) refusing to use his condom and insisting on using hers. The writer ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his own, and now he's getting criticized for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The partner here is pushing for her own condom, possibly because she's planning to get pregnant soon, which complicates things. But why would she insist on using hers if she's using contraception? Maybe she wants to ensure it's her method or there's another reason, like STI concerns.\n\nBut the key point here is that both partners should have agreed on the plan before engaging. If he came prepared with his own condom and she's suddenly changing the plan, it's a matter of negotiation. Insisting on using her condom could be her way of maintaining control, but if he's uncomfortable with that, he has the right to leave. However, by showing up with his own, he might have set an expectation that he wanted to use it, and her refusal could be seen as a deal-breaker for him.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and communication. If she's planning to have kids soon, maybe they should be discussing birth control methods more thoroughly. But if she's pressuring him to use her condom without prior discussion, that might be a red flag. On the other hand, if he's not willing to compromise and leaves, does that make him wrong? It depends on whether he had the right to set boundaries. \n\nHe did bring his own, which implies he wanted to use it. She refused and made it a non-negotiable. He chose not to comply and left, which is his right. But the friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe in her friend's view, he should have gone along. However, consent requires both parties to agree. If she's not allowing him to use his own condom, and he's not comfortable using hers without knowing her reasons, leaving is a valid choice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's respecting her choice and they could find a middle ground, maybe. But since he left to avoid compromising his own boundaries, he's not necessarily wrong. The problem might lie in the lack of prior communication. If he had discussed the condom preference earlier, this might have been avoided. But in the moment, his decision to leave because he wasn't comfortable with her terms could be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
