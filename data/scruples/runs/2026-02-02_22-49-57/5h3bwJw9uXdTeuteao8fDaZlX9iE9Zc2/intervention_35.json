Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking for advice about whether they're at fault for not using their girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they went over to a girl they've been talking to for a few weeks. They brought their own condom, but she insisted on using hers. When he tried to use his, she got upset and said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He ended up not using a condom and left, then received a message from her friend calling him an asshole. Now, he's doubting if he should have gone along with her choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is about condom use and consent. The man brought his own, which is good, but the woman wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, but she refused. He then didn't use a condom and left. The question is whether he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nIn terms of sexual health, using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon is interesting. If they're planning to have a child within two months, then using a condom would prevent pregnancy. However, if she's not ready, that's a different issue. But in this case, she wants kids soon, which implies she might be okay with not using a condom. Wait, but he thought she was just \"messing around\" and didn't expect that. So maybe there was a communication problem here.\n\nThe woman's insistence on using her own condom could be for various reasons. Maybe she prefers a certain type, or she wants to check if he's using a fresh one. Alternatively, maybe she was trying to control the situation. But when he tried to use his, she refused. He was scared and ended up not using any. Now, he's being called an asshole by her friend, and he's second-guessing.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, not using a condom at all increases the risk of pregnancy and STIs. However, if she wants to have a baby soon, maybe she's not concerned about pregnancy, but STIs could still be a risk. But the fact that he was prepared with a condom shows he was thinking about protection. She might have her own reasons for wanting to use hers, but if he's not comfortable with that, he has the right to refuse. However, the problem here is that he didn't use any condom, which could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If she's pressuring him to not use his own, but then not allowing him to use hers either, that's a problem. Wait, no, she said she had some, but he was using his. She refused his and wanted to use hers. But he ended up not using any. So, maybe she was trying to control the situation, but he didn't comply, leading to no protection.\n\nIn this scenario, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't use any protection, which is risky. However, the woman's behavior in refusing his condom and being confrontational could also be at fault. But from a health and safety standpoint, using a condom is the responsible choice. If he was okay with using hers, maybe he should have done that. However, if he was uncomfortable with her insisting on hers, he had the right to set boundaries. But the outcome was no protection, which is risky. \n\nAnother angle is that if she wants to have a baby soon, maybe she's not on birth control, so using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But if he's not on a method, then not using a condom could lead to pregnancy. So there's a conflict here. The author might be right in not wanting to use a condom if the goal is to conceive, but the problem is that they might not be ready or it's a misunderstanding. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, but the author thought they were just going to \"mess around for a week or two,\" indicating a possible miscommunication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was prepared to use a condom, which is the right step. The woman's insistence without clear communication might have contributed to the situation. However, the author ended up not using any protection, which is risky. So, the author might be in the wrong because he allowed the situation to escalate without ensuring protection, even if there was pressure from the other person. Alternatively, if the woman is not on birth control and they are trying to conceive, then not using a condom is appropriate. But the author's confusion suggests a lack of clear communication about their intentions and birth control methods.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he was trying to use protection initially, but the situation escalated without a resolution that ensured safety. However, he did end up not using any protection, which is risky. The woman's behavior might have been controlling, but the author could have either used hers or left, but he didn't. So, maybe both parties have some responsibility here. But the question is specifically about the author. If he didn't use any protection and left, but the woman wanted to use hers, maybe he should have either used her condom or not proceeded. Since he didn't use any, he's partially at fault for not ensuring protection, even if the other person was insistent. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't use a condom, which is a safer choice, and the other person's insistence might not justify him not using any.\n"
