Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom. She insisted on using hers instead, and when he tried to use his, she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. He ended up leaving because she refused to use his condom. Now he's confused because her friend called him an asshole and he's wondering if he should have gone along with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and the dynamics between them. The key issue here is the use of condoms. The woman wanted to use her own, but the man had his own. She made it a condition that he use hers, and when he tried to use his, she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. The man left because he wasn't comfortable with that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for safe sex, both partners should discuss and agree on the method before engaging in intercourse. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and neither should feel pressured into using a specific one unless there's a mutual agreement. If the woman insisted on using her own condom and he was okay with that, then there's no issue. But in this case, the man was prepared with his own, and she changed her mind at the last moment. \n\nAnother angle is that the woman might have a reason to prefer her own condom, like maybe she's more familiar with the type or there's a medical reason. However, if the man is uncomfortable with using her condom, he has the right to express that. But in this case, he was okay with using his own, but she refused. The problem is that she made it a non-negotiable condition, which could be seen as pressuring him to use her condom, which he wasn't comfortable with. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon adds another layer. If she's trying to conceive, she might not want to use a condom at all. However, if they're not ready to conceive yet, then using a condom is necessary. The man might have thought they were using protection, but she wanted to try to get pregnant. That could be a conflict in expectations. \n\nIn terms of consent and negotiation, both parties should be on the same page. If the woman insisted on using her condom and the man was okay with that, then it's fine. But in this case, the man was prepared with his own, and she changed her mind. The man left because he wasn't comfortable with her insisting on her own, which might be his right. However, if he was okay with using her condom, then his refusal to use hers could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the fact that she made it a condition to use hers and he refused might indicate that he was not respecting her boundaries. If she's trying to conceive, maybe she's making a choice to not use a condom, and he's trying to use one. That could be a bigger issue. However, in the scenario described, she wanted to use her own condom, not none. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nThe man's actions could be seen as not respecting her decision to use her own condom, especially if she had already mentioned her desire to have kids soon. If he was aware of that, maybe he should have considered that she might not want to use a condom at all, which could explain her insistence on using hers. But the man might not have realized that. \n\nOn the other hand, the man had his own prepared and was trying to use it, which shows he wanted to be safe. If she's trying to conceive, using a condom would prevent that, so there's a conflict in their intentions. If the woman is trying to get pregnant, she wouldn't want to use a condom. So maybe she wanted to not use any, but he wanted to use one. But in the scenario, she said to use hers, not none. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, it's about mutual consent and clear communication. If the woman insisted on her own condom, and the man refused to use it, then he might be in the wrong if the reason she wanted to use hers was to avoid pregnancy. But if he didn't know about her desire to conceive, then it's a communication breakdown. However, the man's decision to leave might be his way of setting a boundary. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the woman was trying to get pregnant and wanted to not use a condom, but he was trying to use one, then he's in the right. But if she wanted to use her own for a different reason (like she had one, or maybe it's a specific type), then he might be in the wrong for not using hers. \n\nBut given the information, the man was prepared with his own, and she insisted on hers. He left because she wouldn't let him use his. If he's comfortable with using her condom, then maybe he was wrong to back out. However, if he was uncomfortable for any reason (like not trusting her, or the condom was not from a reliable source), then he's within his rights to refuse. \n\nIn many cases, using a condom is a shared responsibility. Both partners should have a say, and it's important to agree beforehand. The man in this case might have thought they were using protection, but the woman wanted to try to get pregnant. If that's the case, then the man's refusal to use her condom (assuming she wanted no condom) could be a conflict of interests. However, the scenario states she wanted to use her own, not no condom. So maybe the man is wrong because he didn't respect her decision to use her own condom. \n\nAlternatively, if the woman was trying to get pregnant and didn't want to use any condom, and he wanted to use one, then he's in the right. But the problem is the story says she wanted to use hers. So the man's refusal to use hers could be inconsiderate. \n\nBut the key point is that the woman made it a condition to use hers, and the man left because he wouldn't. If the man had agreed to use hers, then there's no issue. Since he didn't and left, maybe he's in the wrong. However, if there was a misunderstanding about whether she wanted to use a condom at all, then it's a communication problem. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the man's refusal to use her condom was justified. If there's no reason to believe the woman's condom is unsafe, then the man is in the wrong for not using hers. But if there's a reason he's uncomfortable (like he doesn't trust her), then he's in the right. However, the story doesn't mention any such issues. The man just had his own and she wanted to use hers. \n\nIn public health contexts, using a condom is a personal choice, but both partners should agree. If she insisted on hers and he went along, that's good. If he refused and left, maybe he's in the wrong unless there's a valid reason. Since the story doesn't mention any valid reason, the author might be in the wrong. However, if the woman was trying to get pregnant and didn't want to use a condom, but he wanted to, then it's a different scenario. But in the given text, she said to use hers, not none. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision to use her own condom. The woman had the right to choose her own, and the man's refusal to comply with her condition (using hers) led to the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
