Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening not to proceed if he didn't. The guy then left, and now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy had his own condoms, which he brought from home. When they were about to have sex, he offered to use his, but she refused and said they should use hers. He thought maybe she wanted to get pregnant soon, but she didn't clarify. He became scared and left. Her friend later called him an asshole. The question is whether he was wrong not to use his own condom.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and autonomy. In a sexual relationship, both partners should have the right to agree on the terms of their sexual activity. Condom use is a personal choice and a health and safety issue. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's method (like using a specific brand or bringing their own), that's a communication issue. However, if the refusal to use a condom from another person is based on preference, but it's causing conflict, that's a problem.\n\nIn this case, the girl is insisting on using her own condoms, possibly because she has other plans (like wanting to get pregnant soon), but she didn't communicate that clearly. The guy, on the other hand, had already prepared his own and was ready to use it. The fact that she wouldn't allow him to use his own and made it a deal-breaker might indicate that she's not respecting his preparedness or his possible concerns about her preferences (like STIs or pregnancy). \n\nWait, but if she wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she doesn't want a condom at all. But she's insisting on using hers, which might be a way to delay pregnancy. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. If she wants kids soon but is using her own condoms, that's contradictory. Unless she's using them to prevent pregnancy until she's ready. But the guy thought she might be okay with getting pregnant in a few months, which is conflicting with her actual behavior.\n\nThe guy left because he was scared. That's his right if he felt pressured. But was he wrong to not use her condom? Condoms are standard for safe sex. If he was concerned about her not using a condom at all, then insisting on using his own is responsible. But here, the issue is about whose condom to use, not whether to use one. Using a condom is a good practice, so either brand should be fine. But if she's against using a condom at all, that's different. However, the scenario says she mentioned wanting kids soon, which doesn't align with using a condom. Maybe there's a communication breakdown.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether using his own condom is wrong. The main factors are consent, safety, and mutual agreement. If both partners agree to use a condom, the brand shouldn't matter unless there's a specific reason. If she's insistent on using hers, maybe she's not comfortable with his. Alternatively, if she wants to get pregnant, then using a condom isn't in line with that goal. But she's using a condom, which is confusing. Maybe she's lying about wanting to get pregnant soon and actually wants to prevent it for now, but that's speculative.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is a good practice. The guy was prepared. If she's uncomfortable with his method (maybe he's using a specific brand she doesn't like, or she prefers a different type), that's a valid concern, but she should have discussed it beforehand. Insisting on using her own might be a way to maintain control over the situation. However, if she's making it a non-negotiable demand, that could be a red flag about her behavior, not his.\n\nThe guy left because he felt threatened. If she was pressuring him into using her condom and not allowing his, that's a power dynamic issue. But if both are in agreement to use a condom, the brand is a minor issue. The fact that she's threatening to not have sex unless he uses hers is concerning. That's not healthy communication. The guy leaving might be a sign that he's not comfortable with her controlling the situation, which is a valid response.\n\nIn summary, the guy wasn't wrong to bring his own condom. Insisting on using a condom is responsible. However, if the issue is about who provides it, then it's a matter of preference. But if she's pressuring him to use hers and not allowing his, that's a problem. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then insists on using a condom is contradictory. The guy leaving might be the right choice if he felt unsafe or pressured. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
