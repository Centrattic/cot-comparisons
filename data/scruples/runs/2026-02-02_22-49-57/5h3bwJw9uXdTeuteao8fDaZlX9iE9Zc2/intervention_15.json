Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over which condom to use.\n\nFirst, the guy brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers. He thought she mentioned wanting kids soon, which made him hesitant. He backed out, and she called him an asshole via her friend. The user thinks the author is not wrong, but they want to check.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? Consent and communication. Using a condom is a mutual decision. Both parties should agree on the method of protection. The guy tried to use his, but she refused. He then left, which shows he respected her boundaries. However, she might feel pressured if he insisted. But he didn't force her; he left. \n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is that he brought his own, which shows he was prepared. She had her own, so maybe there's a trust issue. Also, her friend calling him an asshole adds to the conflict. The guy might have been okay to leave if he felt uncomfortable. Using her condom is fine if both agree, but he didn't have to comply if he felt it was a problem. \n\nHe didn't use his condom because she refused. But why was he scared? Maybe because of her wanting kids, so using her condom might mean she's not on birth control, or maybe she's not being honest. But he chose to leave, which is his right. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the guy isn't in the wrong because he left instead of forcing the issue. The girl might have overreacted. But maybe he should have discussed it more. However, he did try to use a condom, which is responsible. \n\nThe key points: mutual agreement is essential. He didn't force the situation, backed out when she was persistent, and left. She might have pressured him, but he didn't push back. \n\nSo, answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
