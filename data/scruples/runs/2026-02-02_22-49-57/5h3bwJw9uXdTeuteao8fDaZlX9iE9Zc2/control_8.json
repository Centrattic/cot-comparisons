Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing their own condom to a sexual encounter, but the girlfriend insists on using hers. The author refuses and leaves. The girlfriend's friend is upset, making the author question their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control and the condom is necessary. But the author brought one, and the girlfriend insists on hers. Why would she do that? Maybe she has a reason, like trust issues or maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom. But if she's not, using her own might still be a way to control the situation. \n\nHowever, the author is in a relationship where they're supposed to trust each other. If they're monogamous, maybe using her own condom is okay, but the author is worried about STIs. But the author didn't mention that. The girlfriend could be pressuring him for control, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe author's refusal to use his own might be about STI prevention. If they're in a monogamous relationship and both are healthy, maybe it's okay, but if there's any doubt, using a condom is safer. However, the girlfriend's insistence could be manipulation. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests the girlfriend's side. But the author left, which is his right. The main issue is consent and mutual agreement on sexual health. If the author is uncomfortable using her condom without knowing her STI status, he's in the right to refuse. But if they're in a committed relationship with mutual trust, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the context of their relationship. If they're monogamous and both healthy, the author might be in the right to leave if he's not comfortable. But if the girlfriend is pressuring him without valid reasons, he's justified. However, if there's no health risk, using her condom shouldn't be a problem. The key is mutual consent and health safety.\n"
