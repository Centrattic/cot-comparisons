Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether to use their own condom or the girlfriend's.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy brings his own condom, starts to use it, but the girl insists on using hers. She even says if he doesn't use hers, he should leave. He leaves, and later gets a friend of hers texting him calling him an asshole. The guy is wondering if he did the right thing, and the user thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a relationship and consent perspective, both parties should have control over their own bodies and health. Using a condom is a personal choice, and it's important for STI prevention. If the girl wants to use her own, maybe she trusts them more or has a reason. But forcing someone to use a specific condom could be an issue. However, the guy had his own, which is his right. Refusing to use a condom because someone else insists on their own could be a problem. But here, the guy was willing to use a condom, just not hers. The girl made it a deal-breaker.\n\nWait, but if she's the one who insists on using hers, and he's willing to use a condom but not hers, maybe there's a power dynamic here. But he's not refusing to use a condom altogether; he's just bringing his own. If she's not comfortable with his, that's her choice. However, if he's not comfortable using hers, he's within his rights to leave. Using protection is important for both parties. If she's okay with using a condom but wants it to be hers, that's her preference. But if he's not okay with that, it's his right to set that boundary. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of STI prevention. If he's bringing his own, maybe he wants to ensure the condom is his choice. But the girl might have her own reasons for wanting to use hers. If they're both healthy and on the same page, maybe it's a minor issue. However, the girl's insistence to the point of making him leave could indicate that she's not respecting his choice. But he's also not violating her wishes by using his own. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should be involved in the decision. If she's pressuring him to use hers and he's standing his ground, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if she's uncomfortable with his condom, it's a two-way street. But he's not refusing to use a condom at all. So, the guy's actions are within his rights. The girl's friend labeling him an asshole might be overreacting. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy is not in the wrong. He's asserting his own boundaries, using protection, and the girl is imposing her own. Both have valid points, but neither is wrong in their own choices. The guy left because she wouldn't budge, which is his right. Therefore, answer B.\n"
