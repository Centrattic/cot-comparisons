Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The man brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. He left and later got a text from her friend calling him an asshole. Now he's unsure if he should have complied with her request.\n\nKey points: Condom use is a mutual decision. Both should agree on which one to use. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon adds context. If she's using her own condoms, maybe she's on birth control, but that's not certain. However, the main issue is consent and compromise. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences is important. He came prepared with his own, which is good. But she insisted on hers. If she's against him using his, maybe there's an underlying reason. However, he didn't push back forcefully beyond leaving, which is his right. But maybe he should have communicated better. \n\nLegally and health-wise, using a condom is important. If she's insistent, maybe she has STI concerns or prefers her brand. But forcing him to use hers without his consent isn't right. He has the right to use his own. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, mutual respect is key. He chose to leave instead of agreeing to something he wasn't comfortable with. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, the woman being confrontational and her friend's reaction might indicate she's overreacting. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he left because he wasn't comfortable with her condom, that's his right. But if she was trying to make a point about using hers for health reasons, maybe he should have considered that. However, the woman's behavior (making him leave and the friend's harsh message) might reflect her being wrong. \n\nConclusion: The wrong here is on the girlfriend for being pushy and making him leave, but the user might be partially at fault for not discussing it more. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he left and didn't force the issue, maybe he's not. Alternatively, he could have compromised. But given the info, the answer might be B (No) because he had the right to use his own condom and left when she was unreasonable.\n"
