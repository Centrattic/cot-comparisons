Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person went over to their girlfriend, and they were about to have sex. The author brought a Trojan condom, freshly opened the box, and put it in their pocket. When they got there, they started to take out the condom before insertion. The girlfriend said \"no no, there's no need, I have some,\" but the author insisted they already had it. Then the girlfriend became persistent, saying they should use hers and wouldn't proceed unless they did. The author mentions that the girlfriend had mentioned wanting kids soon, in two months, but they thought they'd just maybe mess around for a week or two. Now the author is scared and backs out, leaves, and later receives a message from the girlfriend's friend calling the author an asshole. The author is now wondering if they should have complied with using the girlfriend's condom.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted?\n\nFirst, I should consider the basics of consent and mutual agreement in sexual activity. Condom use is a personal choice that both parties should agree on. If one person is uncomfortable using the other's condom for any reason, they have the right to say no. However, the situation here is a bit complex because the girlfriend is refusing to proceed unless her condom is used, which could be seen as pressuring the author into a specific method without mutual consent.\n\nThe author had their own condom and was prepared. The girlfriend then insists on using hers, possibly for reasons like not wanting to use someone else's condom, or maybe even because she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom. However, the author might have a right to use their own condom if that's their preference. But if the girlfriend is not willing to proceed at all unless she uses her own, that could be a problem. The author chose to leave, which seems like a responsible decision to avoid compromising their own boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's mention of wanting kids soon. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe the author's condom use was a way to prevent pregnancy, which the girlfriend was against. However, since they are in a relationship and planning to have kids, maybe they should have discussed these contraceptive methods beforehand. The author might not have been aware of her intentions, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut the key point here is consent. The girlfriend is pressuring the author to use her condom, possibly without considering the author's comfort or reasons for bringing his own. The author, in turn, is standing by his choice to use his own, which is his right. However, the girlfriend's refusal to proceed unless her terms are met can be seen as a form of coercion. The author's decision to leave seems like a reasonable action to avoid an uncomfortable or unsafe situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author is uncomfortable using the girlfriend's condom for any reason (like not knowing if it's safe, or if he's on PrEP or something), he has a right to his own method. But the girlfriend's insistence that he must use hers, to the point of making him leave or threatening not to have sex at all, could be problematic. It's about mutual respect and communication. The author might not be in the wrong for not using hers, especially if he felt pressured and chose to leave to maintain his boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as he respected his boundaries and left the situation when pressured. However, there's room for both sides to have miscommunication. The girlfriend might have felt that using her condom was necessary for her plans, but the author's right to use his own should have been respected. Since the girlfriend was pressuring him, the author's choice to leave was appropriate.\n"
