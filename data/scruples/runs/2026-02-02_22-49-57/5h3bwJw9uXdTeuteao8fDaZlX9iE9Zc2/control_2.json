Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a guy who went to his girlfriend's place intending to use a condom he brought. She insisted on using her own and even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his own. Now he's confused and thinking maybe he should have gone along with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy came prepared with a condom, which is responsible. The girl, however, wanted to use her own and was firm about it, even making him leave if he didn't comply. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong by not using her condom.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and pregnancy. However, the guy brought his own, which he might prefer for reasons like comfort, trust in the product, or personal preference. But the girl is the one who wants to use hers and is setting a boundary. If she's insisting, maybe she has her own reasons\u2014maybe she's not comfortable with his choice or has a preference. \n\nBut the bigger issue here might be consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on which condom to use. If the girl is pressuring him to use hers and he's uncomfortable, that's a problem. However, in this case, he was ready to use his own, but she wouldn't allow it. That could be a red flag because it's her taking control of the situation in a way that might not respect his autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then insisted on using a condom complicates things. If she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's not concerned about pregnancy prevention, but still wants to use a condom for other reasons. However, the guy's refusal to use her condom might have been about his own comfort or distrust in the product. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the key points are consent, mutual respect, and communication. The girl's insistence without negotiation might be problematic. However, the guy's decision to leave might have been about respecting his own boundaries. But by not using her condom, he might be putting her at risk if she didn't have another reason for using hers (like STI prevention).\n\nOn the other hand, if the guy is uncomfortable using her condom for any reason (like she's not being honest, or he's not sure about her STI status), then he has the right to set boundaries. But the girl's behavior here seems controlling. Insisting on her own terms without allowing discussion could be a sign of disrespect.\n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong, the girl's actions might be more problematic because she's refusing to let him use his own, which could be a breach of his autonomy. However, the guy didn't use her condom, which if she's set on using it, he might be in the wrong for not complying. But given that he brought his own and she's making it a deal-breaker, maybe both have valid points. But the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSince the guy left because she was insistent and she later sent her friend to message him, maybe the girl is the one being unreasonable. The guy's choice to leave might be a boundary he's setting, which is okay. However, if he's in a relationship and she's setting a boundary about using her condom, refusing to comply could be an issue. But it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn health and safety, using a condom is the right choice. If the girl is pressuring him to use hers, but he's not comfortable, he has the right to say no. However, in this case, she's not allowing him to use his own, which is different. If he's unwilling to use hers, he's not using any, which is risky. But he was prepared with his own. The fact that she's making it a deal-breaker could be a red flag. So, maybe the guy is not in the wrong because he's respecting his own boundaries and she's not allowing compromise.\n"
