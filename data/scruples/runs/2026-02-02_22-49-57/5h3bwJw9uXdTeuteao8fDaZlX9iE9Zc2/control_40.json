Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he and his girlfriend were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom. She insisted they use hers instead. He was okay with using his own, but she wouldn't let him and even threatened to leave if he didn't use hers. He went along with her, but now he's second-guessing.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and mutual agreement. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on what they're comfortable with. Using a condom is a personal choice, and each person should have the right to use their own if they prefer. The woman wanted to use her own, maybe because of brand preference, expiration, or just personal choice. But the man had already brought his own, so perhaps he felt uncomfortable using hers for some reason.\n\nBut wait, she insisted on hers, and he had a ready one. If she was uncomfortable with his condom, maybe there's an underlying issue. However, in the scenario described, the man didn't force her to use his. He offered to use his, and she asked to use hers. He then complied. Wait, no, the man says he had a condom and was about to use it, but she pushed him to use hers instead. He tried to use his, but she was insistent. Then he backed down and used hers. Wait, the original post says he was going to use his own but she said no and made him use hers. So he did use her condom, right? Then why is he questioning it?\n\nWait, the user says he had a condom and started to unwrap it, but she said no, and he ended up using hers. So he did go along with her request. But he's now wondering if he was wrong to comply. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should communicate their needs. If she was on birth control or using other methods, that's her choice. But if they were using condoms for protection, both should have a say. However, forcing someone to use a specific condom isn't typical. But in this case, she didn't force him; she was insistent but he chose to comply. If he's now feeling pressured, maybe it's about his own comfort. But if the issue was about her wanting to use her own, perhaps she had her reasons. \n\nBut the key here is whether he was wrong in not using his own. If he felt uncomfortable using her condom but went ahead anyway, that might be a problem. However, the situation shows that he was open to using hers. The woman's insistence might have been about her own preferences. However, if there's a medical reason or if he had concerns about her condom (like expiration), that's different. But the post doesn't mention that. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might be adding pressure, but that's on the friend. The main issue is whether he was wrong for complying. If both partners agree, using either condom is okay. Since he used hers after she insisted, and he didn't force her, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he had a valid reason to be concerned about her condom (like if it was expired or damaged), then it would be different. But the post doesn't mention that. So, in the absence of such issues, it's about mutual agreement. Since he went along with her preference, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
