Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to have sex with his girlfriend but she insisted on using hers instead. He refused and left. The friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy had a condom ready, which shows he was prepared. The girl insisted on using hers, maybe for her own reasons. He said no and left. The key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and health safety. \n\nCondoms are a personal choice, and either partner can have preferences. The girl might have had a reason for wanting to use hers, like maybe she had a specific type she preferred or wanted to take control. However, the guy was okay with using his, so there's a conflict here.\n\nThe girl said she wouldn't proceed if he didn't use hers, which is a significant statement. Insisting on using her own condom isn't necessarily wrong, but pressuring someone to the point where they leave might be an issue. The guy's reaction was to leave, which could be seen as standing up for his own decision, but it also ended the encounter. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the question is whether he is. The main issue is whether using one's own condom is a deal-breaker. If both parties are in agreement, it's not a problem, but if one insists and the other refuses, it's a matter of negotiation. In this case, the guy stuck to his decision, maybe because he felt more comfortable with his own condom. \n\nHealth-wise, either condom is safe, but if there's a risk of STIs, it's important. If they were in a monogamous relationship and both tested, maybe it's less of an issue. However, the girl's insistence could be about other factors, like her own control or past experiences. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might indicate that the girl's side is seen as justified, but that's from a third party. The guy might be overthinking, but he's second-guessing himself. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he left because he didn't want to use her condom, and she was insistent, it's a matter of mutual respect. He had the right to refuse, but maybe the situation could have been handled with more communication. However, since he was prepared and she changed her mind, he's not necessarily wrong for not using hers. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong."
