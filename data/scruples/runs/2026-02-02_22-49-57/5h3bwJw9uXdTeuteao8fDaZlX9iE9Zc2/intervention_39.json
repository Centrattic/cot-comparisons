Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend. She told him not to use his and insisted on using hers. He refused and left. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon but the guy didn't know if that meant they were trying to conceive right then. The girl was insistent on using her own condom, to the point of making him leave. Then a friend of hers called him an asshole. \n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he was prepared with a condom, which is responsible. But the girl's insistence on using hers might be about her own preferences or maybe she has a reason, like the condom being a specific type or maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need it? Wait, if she wants kids soon, maybe she's not using birth control and wants to conceive, so using a condom would prevent that. But the guy might not be on birth control, so using a condom would be necessary for her to avoid pregnancy if they're not trying yet. But she said she wants kids soon, so maybe she's not using any method and wants to try to get pregnant now. So if the guy uses his condom, that would prevent pregnancy, which she might not want. So she's pushing for her own condom because she doesn't want a condom at all, maybe? Or maybe her condom is a specific type for trying to conceive, like a fertility-friendly one. \n\nThe guy was confused because she mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they would \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it.\" Maybe he misunderstood her intentions. If she wants to get pregnant, then using a condom would be counterproductive. So when she says \"no need, I have some,\" maybe she means she doesn't need a condom because she wants to conceive. But the guy thought they would just wait a bit, so he brought a condom expecting to use it. \n\nSo the conflict is about whether using a condom is necessary. The guy was responsible by bringing one, but the girl wants to try to get pregnant and thus doesn't want a condom. She was insistent because her goal is the opposite of using a condom. The guy, not wanting to comply, left. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, if the girl is trying to conceive, then using a condom would prevent that, which is her goal. So if he insists on using a condom when she doesn't want to, he's undermining her intentions. However, if they're not in a committed monogamous relationship, maybe there's a risk of STIs. But the context says she's his girlfriend, so presumably they're monogamous. \n\nThe guy might have made a mistake by not clarifying her intentions. He thought they were just messing around for a while, but she wanted to try to conceive immediately. So maybe the issue is communication. He assumed she didn't need the condom, but she wanted to try to get pregnant. So his bringing the condom and insisting on using it could be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nHowever, the girl's approach was confrontational. She told him to leave if he didn't use hers, which is extreme. But if her goal is to try to get pregnant, then refusing to have unprotected sex is understandable. The guy might not have considered that she might not be on birth control and wants to conceive, so using a condom would prevent pregnancy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy brought up a responsible action (using a condom), but the girl's insistence on not using it was because of her own reproductive goals. The problem is the lack of communication. The guy didn't confirm her current intentions regarding pregnancy, and she didn't explain her reasons for not wanting his condom. \n\nSo is the author in the wrong? If the girl is trying to conceive and he's using a condom, he's preventing that, which she might see as not respecting her wishes. But the guy also has a right to protection if he's not on birth control. However, the story says he was prepared and didn't know she wanted to try to get pregnant. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he was following his own understanding of the situation. But the girl's reaction was extreme. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl is in the wrong for being insistent without explaining her reasons. The guy might have been in the right to leave if he felt uncomfortable with her demands. But the friend calling him an asshole suggests that the girl's side is seen as the correct action here. \n\nHmm. So the key point is whether respecting the girl's wishes about not using a condom (because she wants to conceive) is wrong. If the guy was okay with trying to get her pregnant, then using a condom would be against her wishes. If he's not on birth control, then using a condom is necessary to prevent pregnancy. But if she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, then not using a condom is what she wants. \n\nThe guy's confusion comes from thinking they would \"mess around for a week or two,\" implying he didn't think they were trying to conceive yet. So he thought they were just having casual sex with protection. The girl, however, wanted to start trying for a baby immediately. So the guy's mistake was not clarifying her intentions. But once she made it clear, he had to decide whether to respect her wishes. If he was okay with trying to get her pregnant, he should have agreed to not use a condom. If he wasn't, then he's right to leave. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own condom and leaving. If he left because he didn't want to have unprotected sex (because he wasn't on birth control, for example), then he's in the right. But if he was willing to have unprotected sex but just wanted to use his own condom for some reason (maybe he's concerned about STIs, but if they're monogamous, that's not an issue), then he's being stubborn. \n\nThe story doesn't mention STI concerns. So assuming monogamous and the girl is trying to conceive, the guy's insistence on a condom is preventing her from getting pregnant. So in that case, he's not respecting her wishes, which could be seen as wrong. However, if he's not on birth control, then not using a condom could lead to pregnancy, which he might not be ready for. So the lack of communication is the main issue. \n\nTherefore, the guy might not be in the wrong because he was following his own understanding of the situation, but the problem is that he didn't communicate properly. The girl's reaction was extreme, but her insistence might be justified if she wants to try to conceive. However, if the guy is not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, he's right to use a condom. \n\nIn the end, it's a communication breakdown. The correct answer might depend on their individual situations, but based on the information given, the guy is not in the wrong for leaving if he wasn't comfortable with having unprotected sex. So answer B.\n"
