Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author went to his girlfriend's place, planning to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He mentions she wanted kids soon but thought they'd just mess around first. When he tried to use his own, she got persistent, saying he should leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and her friend texted him calling him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, consent is key in any sexual activity. Both parties need to agree on the terms. The author had his own condom, which he brought for a reason. The girlfriend's insistence on using hers might be for various reasons\u2014maybe her preference, STI concerns, or even a way to control the situation. However, if she's not comfortable with his condom, that's a red flag. Condom use is a personal choice, and forcing one's own can be an issue. \n\nThe author's refusal to use her condom and leaving could be seen as standing his ground on his own boundaries. However, if she was uncomfortable with his condom, that's her right too. But the situation escalates when she says he has to use hers or leave. That's a form of pressure. The author left, which might be a good move because you shouldn't feel pressured into using someone else's condom without mutual agreement. \n\nBut there's a part where he mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's using her own condoms, maybe there's something about them that's important, like a specific type for fertility or something else. But the author didn't ask why she wanted hers\u2014he just refused. Maybe there's a communication breakdown here. However, the key point is consent. If she's not okay with his condom, then proceeding without her consent would be wrong. But in this case, she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers, so he left. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe the girlfriend's side is being portrayed as the victim. But it's possible the girlfriend is pressuring him into using her condom against his will. Using someone else's condom without knowing their STI status could be risky. The author might be protecting himself by not using her condom. \n\nSo, the question is, is the author wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom? If the girlfriend is insistent, and the author refuses, is that a boundary issue or is he justified? The answer likely depends on communication and mutual consent. Since the author had his own, and the girlfriend wanted hers, and he stood his ground, maybe he's not wrong. But if she was uncomfortable with his condom, that's another aspect. However, the main issue here is that the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom, which he isn't comfortable with. So, he leaves. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But in terms of personal boundaries and consent, the author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his own boundaries. However, if the situation involved her not being okay with his condom, then mutual agreement is necessary. Since she made it a deal-breaker, and he left, maybe he's in the right. But the friend's reaction complicates things. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had his own condom and refused to use hers when she was insistent, which could be a matter of personal safety and boundaries. However, there's also the aspect of mutual consent. If she's uncomfortable with his condom, maybe he should have asked why instead of just refusing. But given the situation, his choice to leave might be justified.\n"
