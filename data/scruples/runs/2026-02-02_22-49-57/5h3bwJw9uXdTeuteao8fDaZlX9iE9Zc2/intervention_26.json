Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe user went over to a girl he's been talking to for 3-4 weeks. He brought his own condom. When they were about to have sex, she said not to use his and wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, but she insisted on hers, even to the point of not letting him proceed unless he used hers. She mentioned she wants kids soon but thought they'd \"mess around\" first. The user felt scared and left. Then her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he was wrong not to use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The girl didn't want him to use his own, which is her right, but she was also being controlling by making it a deal-breaker. The user had his own prepared, which shows he was responsible. However, the girl was insisting on her own, possibly for reasons like STI protection or other health concerns. But she also mentioned wanting kids soon, which might complicate things. If she's not on birth control or wants to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy, but maybe she wanted to use her own for some reason. \n\nThe user left when she became persistent and even aggressive (her friend calling him an asshole). Was he wrong to leave? Well, in consensual situations, both parties should agree on the terms. If she was pressuring him to not use his own, which he had prepared, that's a problem. The user should have the right to use his own condom. But maybe she had a reason for her own, like maybe she's tested for STIs and he wasn't, or vice versa. However, the user isn't at fault for bringing his own. If she was making it a non-negotiable condition, that's her choice, but the user has the right to set boundaries too. If he didn't want to use hers, he could leave. So in that case, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own safety. However, the situation might be more about respecting each other's boundaries. The user might have been in a right to leave, but if the girl was pressuring him, maybe he should have communicated better. But given the scenario, he felt scared and left. So, considering all that, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
