Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted. The situation is a bit complicated because of the context provided.\n\nFirst, the author went to see his girlfriend after talking for a few weeks. He brought his own condom, which is responsible. They were about to have sex, and he pulls out the condom. She says no, insists on using hers. He mentions she had previously mentioned wanting kids soon, which makes him wonder why she's pushing for her condom. He refuses and leaves. Then her friend messages him, calling him an asshole for making a big deal out of nothing. Now he's second-guessing himself.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. Condom use is a mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on which condom to use. The girlfriend is insisting on her own, and the author is uncomfortable because of her prior mention of wanting to have kids. Maybe she's not using her own condom because she doesn't want protection? That could imply she's open to pregnancy, which contradicts the author's intention to use a condom. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author is not using his condom, which he brought, because the girlfriend is refusing it. If she's insistent, maybe she doesn't want him to use a condom at all. The author should have communicated his concerns about her mentioning wanting kids soon. If he's not on the same page with her regarding protection, it's his right to not proceed. However, leaving the situation might be a valid choice if they can't agree. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is pressuring him to not use a condom, that's a red flag. But the author's side is that he's respecting her request once she insists, but his discomfort comes from her previous statements. So, maybe he's in the right for not going along if he believes she's trying to get him to have unprotected sex against his wishes. Condoms are about protection and preventing pregnancy. If she wants to use her own, maybe she's comfortable with it, but if he's not, he should not compromise. \n\nThe friend's reaction might be based on not understanding the context. The author might be in the right if he's following his own boundaries, even if it means not having sex. Alternatively, if he's not allowing her to use her own condom without understanding her reasons, that's an issue. But given that she's pressuring him and he has a reason to be concerned (her mention of wanting kids), he's probably not in the wrong for not proceeding. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
