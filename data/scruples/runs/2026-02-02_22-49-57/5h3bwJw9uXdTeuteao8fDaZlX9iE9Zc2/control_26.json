Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went to his girlfriend's place intending to use a condom he brought, but she insisted on using hers instead. He refused and left when she wouldn't let him use his own. Now, he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and sexual health. Condoms are a mutual agreement, right? Both partners should have a say in how they're used. But there's also the aspect of personal responsibility for STI prevention and pregnancy. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control and using condoms for protection. However, she's asking to use her own, which could be a preference for brand, type, or just her method of control. But why would she refuse his condom? Maybe she's not comfortable with his, or maybe she has a reason to trust hers more?\n\nWait, the guy had his own ready. He went prepared, but she wanted to use hers. In some cases, people might prefer to use their own condoms for various reasons, like hygiene, trust issues, or just personal preference. But the key here is that he felt scared and left because she was persistent. Did he have a right to leave? If she was pressuring him, but the pressure was about using a condom, maybe he's wrong to refuse. But if the pressure was about not using a condom at all, then he might be right. However, in this case, she just wanted to use her own instead of his. \n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole complicates things. Maybe the girlfriend was in the right to want to use her own condom, but the guy's refusal was a problem. Alternatively, maybe the guy was in the right to want to use his own. But the real issue is about mutual consent. If the girl was not willing to proceed unless he used her condom, and he didn't want to, then he had the right to leave. However, if using a condom is a mutual decision, then refusing might be a problem. But since he was willing to use a condom, the fact that he chose his own should be okay. \n\nAnother angle: If the girl wanted to use her own, maybe she had a reason, like maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom for pregnancy but still wants one for STIs, so using her own makes sense. But if he's not using a condom at all, that's a problem. Wait, in the story, he was going to use a condom, but she wanted to use hers. So he was going to use a condom regardless. The issue is whose to use. That's more about personal choice. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the use of a condom. If she's saying \"we're using mine,\" but he's okay with using a condom, then using hers should be acceptable. If he refuses and leaves, is that his right? Yes, if he's uncomfortable. However, maybe the problem is that he had a condom ready, and she had one too, but he was insistent on using his. But why? If he's bringing his own, maybe he has a brand preference, but she has hers. There's no inherent wrong in either. \n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong by not using her condom. If he had to leave because she wouldn't let him use his own, perhaps that's a communication issue. But if he's insistent on using his own, maybe he's not wrong. However, if she's not going to proceed unless he uses her condom, and he refuses, then they're at an impasse. The key is that he was willing to use a condom, which is the right thing. The conflict is about whose condom to use, which is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have a say. If she's okay with using a condom, then using her own is fine. If he's okay with using hers, then that's the way to go. But if he's not, then leaving is his choice. However, the friend calling him an asshole might indicate that the girlfriend's side is being more vocal. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he was willing to use a condom but just preferred his own, then he's not wrong for leaving. But if she's pressuring him to not use a condom at all, that's different. But in this case, she's just changing the brand. So maybe he's not wrong. Answer B.\n"
