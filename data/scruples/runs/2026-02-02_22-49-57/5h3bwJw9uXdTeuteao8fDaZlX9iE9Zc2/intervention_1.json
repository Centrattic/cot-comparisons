Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted. The situation is that the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend refused and said they should use hers. He ended up not having sex and left, then got a backlash from her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Condoms are about both protection and mutual agreement. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, maybe for reasons like STI protection, pregnancy, or personal preference. The author had his own, but the key point is whether using his condom instead of hers was a violation of her boundaries.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's preferences and boundaries. If the girlfriend clearly stated that she wouldn't proceed unless her condom was used, and the author didn't comply, that's a form of withholding consent. The author chose not to use her condom and left, which could be seen as respecting his own boundaries, but walking away when the other partner isn't comfortable is also a factor.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's insistence on using her own condom might have been based on her own health or pregnancy prevention needs. If the author was okay with using his condom but she wasn't, then he should have respected her choice. By not using her condom, he might have disregarded her health and relationship intentions (like wanting kids soon, which implies she's trying to conceive but maybe not yet ready for unprotected sex).\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt pressured by her ultimatum. But in such situations, the decision should be mutual. If she's not comfortable using his condom, he should not proceed. The fact that he left might be seen as standing his ground, but the issue is whether she felt pressured to use her own or if he was being non-compliant.\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests that from her side, using her own is important. The author might be right in not wanting to use his, but if she's insistent, maybe he should have respected that. The wrong here could be on both sides, but the main question is about the author's actions. If he respects her boundaries, he should use her condom. If he doesn't, he's in the wrong. Since he didn't comply and left, it's a judgment call. But the fact that she was clear and he didn't follow through, maybe he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if he had a reason to not use hers (like trust issues), but the post doesn't mention that. So probably, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her stated boundary.\n"
