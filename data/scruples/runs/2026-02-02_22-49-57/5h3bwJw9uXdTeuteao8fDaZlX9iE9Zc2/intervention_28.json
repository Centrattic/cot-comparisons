Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the couple was about to have sex, and the author brought his own condom. When he tried to use it, the girlfriend insisted on using hers instead, and even said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. The author refused and left, and now her friend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or is trying to conceive. However, the author thought they would just \"mess around for a week or two\" before that, so maybe he assumed they needed protection. But if she wants to get pregnant soon, using a condom would prevent that. So there's a conflict between their intentions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement. Condoms require both parties' agreement. If she insisted on her own condom and he didn't want to use hers, but she refused to proceed unless he did, there's a power dynamic here. However, the author brought his own, so using hers might not be his preference. But why did she get so insistent? Maybe she wanted to use her own for a reason, like STI prevention or pregnancy. But if she wants kids, using a condom would counter that. \n\nThe author left instead of using hers. Is that the right call? If she's not comfortable using his, there's a potential issue. But if he refuses to use hers, and she's not on another form of contraception, then using a condom is necessary for her safety. However, if she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So there's a conflict here between their desires.\n\nIn terms of consent, both should agree on the method of contraception. If she's not willing to use his, and he's not willing to use hers, and there's no alternative, then proceeding without a condom could lead to unintended consequences. The author left, which might be seen as standing his ground, but if she's trying to conceive, not using a condom could be her intention. But if he's not ready to have kids, he's protecting himself. \n\nHowever, the friend calling him an asshole is a red flag. Maybe the girlfriend overreacted, but it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The author had the right to prefer his own condom, but if she's not comfortable with that, she should have communicated clearly earlier. The author leaving might be a way to prioritize his own comfort, but if there's a mutual need for protection (like STIs), then not using a condom could be risky for both. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the girlfriend wanted to use her own for a valid reason (like STI protection), then he might be at fault for not respecting her choice. But if the issue is about wanting to get pregnant, and he's not ready, then his refusal is a valid stance. The problem is that without mutual agreement on contraception, it's a mess. The author's decision to leave might be a responsible choice to avoid pressure, but the girlfriend's insistence without considering his preference could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author had the right to prefer his own condom and left when she wouldn't allow that, while the girlfriend's insistence might have been about her own goals (pregnancy), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of mutual consent on the method. Since he left without using any, if she's not on another form of birth control, that could be risky for her. But if she's trying to get pregnant, not using a condom aligns with that. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries, even if it led to conflict.\n"
