Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted they use hers instead of his. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details of the situation. The author had a condom in his pocket, ready to use. When he tried to use it, the girl said no and wanted to use hers. She was persistent, even to the point of making him leave if he didn't. Then, her friend called him an asshole for not going along with her. The author is now questioning his decision.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and communication regarding safe sex. Both parties should have a mutual agreement on using protection. The author came prepared with his own condom, which is a responsible move. However, the girl didn't mention having her own until he tried to use his. The author might not have known that she had her own, so he assumed it was okay to use his. But when she insisted on using hers, he refused and left. \n\nBut wait, is it wrong to not use the partner's condom when they prefer it? Or is it the other way around? The key here is that the author was ready to use a condom, which shows he's considering safe sex. The girl, on the other hand, wanted to use her own. If she had her own, maybe she had a reason. For example, some people have preferences about which brand to use, or maybe there was a prior agreement or expectation. However, the author didn't know she had hers. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both should communicate their preferences beforehand. If the girl didn't mention having her own condom until the moment, it might have been a last-minute request. The author was in a position where he had already brought his own. Insisting on using hers without prior discussion could be seen as a sudden change of terms, which the author might not be comfortable with. \n\nAlso, the girl's reaction of making him leave if he didn't comply might indicate that she was being inflexible. If she was truly open to using his condom, she might have brought it up earlier. The fact that her friend is calling him an asshole adds another layer, maybe implying that using her condom is the expected norm, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, both condoms should be equally effective as long as they're properly used. However, some people might have specific reasons for preferring their own, like knowing the expiration date or type. If the author was okay with using his, and she suddenly insisted on hers, it's a matter of consent and mutual agreement. \n\nIn many discussions around safe sex, it's emphasized that both partners should be comfortable with the choice of protection. The author could be in the right for not using a condom he didn't know about. But if she had already communicated that she wanted to use her own, then maybe he should have respected that. However, in the situation described, she only mentioned it at that moment, not when they were planning. \n\nSo, the author's action was to leave when she insisted. That shows he's standing his ground on his prepared choice. But was it wrong? If the girl had a valid reason to use hers, maybe. But if it's a sudden change without prior discussion, the author might not be in the wrong. He's being responsible by using a condom, but the choice of which one can be a matter of preference. \n\nAlternatively, if the girl wanted to avoid using a condom altogether, but in this case, she just wanted to use hers, the author's stance is about using protection, which is right. But the conflict is about whose to use. In that case, the author isn't wrong for not using his own, but if she had her own, maybe he could have used hers. But he didn't know that she had one until the moment. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on communication and mutual consent. Since the author came prepared and the girl didn't mention hers until later, maybe he didn't have a chance to discuss it. However, once she did, if he was okay with using hers, he could have. But since he was insistent on his own, and she was equally insistent, both might have been at fault for not discussing this ahead of time. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering that he used a condom and just had a preference for his own, and the girl's last-minute insistence, the author's action of not using his own when she wanted hers might not be the wrong choice. However, it's possible that in some contexts, using the partner's condom is preferred if they have one, but without prior discussion, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he was using a condom and both should have communicated their preferences before the encounter. The real issue here is the lack of communication, but since the author was taking the initiative to use protection, his stance is reasonable.\n"
