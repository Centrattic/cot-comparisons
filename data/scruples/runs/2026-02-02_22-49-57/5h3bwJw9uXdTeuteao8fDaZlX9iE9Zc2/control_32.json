Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether using his own condom was acceptable or not. The girl said she wanted to use hers, and he refused, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Both parties should have a say in what happens. The guy brought his own condom, which is responsible, but the girl insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't let him proceed unless they used hers. He then refused and left.\n\nNow, why would she be so insistent? She mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's using a specific brand or type? Or perhaps she's trying to control the situation for her own health reasons. But he might not be aware of her reasons. However, in such situations, trust and communication are key. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, but he's uncomfortable, there's a conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, he had his own prepared. Is it okay for him to use his own? Condoms are personal items, and some people prefer their partner's to have control. But others might feel that using their own is a personal choice. There's no right or wrong here, but mutual respect is important. If she's making it a non-negotiable condition, that's a problem because it's her choice to agree to sex under certain conditions. But if he's unwilling to comply, he's within his rights to leave if he doesn't want to use hers.\n\nWait, but in some contexts, if someone is pressuring you to not use a condom, that could be a red flag. But in this case, she's providing her own condom. So maybe she's not against using a condom but wants to use hers. The issue is about whose to use. \n\nIn terms of health and safety, using any condom is better than none. However, if there's a concern about the condom's integrity (like it's expired or not properly stored), that's different. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The guy might have had a reason to prefer his own, but unless there's a specific issue, using hers should be okay. \n\nHe left because she was insistent. That's his choice, but if she's pressuring him to not use his own, maybe he's justified in leaving if he's not comfortable. However, if she's not allowing any condom, that's a problem. Wait, no, she's allowing a condom, just not his. So he's not using a condom at all, which is a problem. Wait, the user says he had his own, but she made him not use it. Wait, no, he was about to use his, but she said no and wanted hers. So he didn't use any because he refused to use hers. Wait, the original question is whether he's wrong for not using his own. Wait, let me recheck the situation.\n\nHe brought his own, was about to use it, but she said no and insisted on using hers. He refused and left. So he didn't use a condom at all. Wait, no, he had his own, but she wouldn't let him use it. So he left without using any. That's a problem. Because he was prepared with a condom, but she wouldn't let him use it, but then he didn't use hers either. Wait, the TL;DR says she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. So he was prepared to use a condom, but she wanted to use hers, and he refused. So he left without having sex. Therefore, he didn't use a condom at all. But the issue is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own. If he's leaving, then he's not using any. But maybe the problem is that he was willing to use a condom, but she wanted to use hers. So in that case, he's not wrong for not using his own because he didn't engage in sex. However, if he had sex without a condom, that would be wrong. But he left. So he's not in the wrong for not using his own because he didn't have sex. The confusion might be in the narrative. The key is that he didn't have sex because he refused to use her condom, so he didn't use his own. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. However, if he had sex without a condom, that's different. But in this case, he didn't have sex. So his choice to leave was his right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
