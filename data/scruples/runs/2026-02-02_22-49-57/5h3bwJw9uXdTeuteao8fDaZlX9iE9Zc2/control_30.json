Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the guy had a condom with him, but the girl insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He didn't go through with it and left, but her friend said he was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and boundaries. Both parties should be on the same page regarding protection. The guy brought his own, but the girl didn't want to use it. Maybe she felt uncomfortable using his, or maybe she had a specific reason for wanting hers. But he tried to use his, she refused, and he left. So he didn't push forward against her wishes. That seems like he respected her boundaries.\n\nWait, but the girl said she wants kids soon. If they were going to use a condom, maybe she actually wanted to prevent pregnancy. But she insisted on using hers instead of his. Maybe she had a preference, like a different brand or type. However, the guy didn't want to use hers, but actually, he had his own. But the girl refused to use his, so he left. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key point is whether using the condom was a mutual decision. If the girl is okay with using a condom, then using hers or his shouldn't matter. But if she's against using any, then he should not proceed. However, in this case, she was okay with using a condom but wanted to use hers. The guy had his own, but she wouldn't let him use it. He didn't force her to use his, but instead chose not to proceed. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, it's better to use a condom. But if the girl is comfortable with her own, maybe she just prefers it. However, the guy's decision to leave because he wasn't willing to use hers might be a personal choice. But is that wrong? If someone is uncomfortable with the other's choice of protection, they should discuss it. But in this case, the guy had his own, but she wanted to use hers. He didn't insist on his, but left instead. \n\nWait, but maybe the issue is that he was the one who brought the condom, so why did he care which one was used? Unless he had a preference. But if the girl wanted to use hers, maybe he should comply. However, he might have had a reason to prefer his own, but the story doesn't mention that. The story says he was scared, maybe because of the pressure? Or maybe he's worried about the effectiveness of her condom. But the story doesn't say he had a problem with hers. \n\nIn terms of consent, if the girl is insisting on using a condom, then using hers is acceptable. If he's okay with that, then using hers is fine. But if he's not comfortable using her condom for any reason (maybe he's concerned about its quality, or he just wants to use his own), then he has the right to leave. However, if the argument is about which condom to use, and both are okay with using a condom, then it's a minor issue. But the girl was insistent, and he left. \n\nThe question is whether he was in the wrong. If the girl is okay with using a condom, then using hers should be acceptable. If he's okay with that, then he should comply. If he doesn't want to use her condom, maybe because he has a right to use his own, but she's the one who brought up the issue. It's about mutual agreement. If he's not willing to use hers, then he's not respecting her choice, but if she's not willing to use his, then he's in a dilemma. \n\nBut in the end, he left instead of using hers, which might be his choice. However, the fact that he had a condom and she wanted to use hers, but he refused, maybe he's in the wrong because he had the option to use her condom if that's what she wanted. If they were both in agreement to use a condom, then using either should be okay. So not using his own but using hers is just a matter of preference. If he's not willing to use hers, then he's not being cooperative, which might put him in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the girl is pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's being controlling. But the guy's decision to leave because he wasn't comfortable with that might be his right. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the guy had a condom and was prepared, but the girl wanted to use hers. If the guy is okay with using hers, then he should do so. If he's not, he has the right to decline, but then he shouldn't proceed. But in this case, he didn't proceed. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he respected her wishes in the sense that he didn't proceed. However, if the issue is that he was using his own and she wanted to use hers, but he refused to use hers, then maybe he's not in the wrong because he had his own. \n\nWait, the story says he had his own, started to unwrap it, and she said to use hers. Then he refused and left. So he went there with the intention to use his own, but she didn't want that. So if he's not willing to use hers, then he's not respecting her choice. But if she's not willing to let him use his, then he has the right to not proceed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should be on the same page. If she wants to use hers, he should comply. If he's not okay with that, he should not proceed. So in this case, he left, which is his choice, but maybe the right thing is to use her condom if she insists. However, if there's a mutual agreement to use a condom, then using either is okay. So perhaps the guy is in the wrong for not using hers if she was insistent, but if he's not comfortable with that, then it's his choice. \n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me check some principles. In sexual situations, both partners need to consent to the same method of protection. If one insists on a method the other is uncomfortable with, then it's a problem. But in this case, the guy was okay with using a condom, but the girl wanted to use hers instead of his. If he's okay with using any condom, then he should go with hers. If he's not okay with using hers, maybe he has a valid reason, but the story doesn't say. So if he's just being stubborn about which condom to use, then he's in the wrong. If he has a reason, like he's not sure about the quality of hers, but that's not mentioned. \n\nTherefore, if the guy is not willing to use the girl's condom despite her insistence, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice. However, if he's not comfortable with that, maybe he's justified. But given that they both agreed to use a condom, the brand or whose it is shouldn't matter. So in this case, the guy is in the wrong because he refused to use her condom when she wanted to, leading to the situation where he left. However, the friend calling him an asshole might be valid if the issue is about using her condom. \n\nAlternatively, if the girl was being too pushy, maybe she's in the wrong. But the question is about the author. So the answer would be whether he's in the wrong. If he's not willing to use her condom and thus leaves, is that wrong? It's a personal choice, but if the issue is about mutual agreement on protection, then he should comply. Hence, he's in the wrong.\n"
