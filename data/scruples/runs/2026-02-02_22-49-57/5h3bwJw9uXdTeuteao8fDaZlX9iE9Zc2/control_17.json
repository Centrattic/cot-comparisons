Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He was prepared, but she wouldn't let him use his, and even made him leave when he refused. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Condom use is a personal choice and a health/safety issue for both parties. The guy had his own, but the girl wanted to use hers. The key point here is whether the girl was being coercive or if the guy was just being overly cautious.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the girl said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. That sounds like a power dynamic where she's pressuring him. But he chose to leave instead of complying, which might be his right. However, the question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom. \n\nBut why would she be so insistent on using hers? Maybe she had her own reasons, like maybe she wanted to ensure a specific type of condom was used, or perhaps she had a health concern and wanted her own. Or maybe she was trying to prevent pregnancy herself, especially since she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's using her own condom, maybe she's on some method and just wants to be extra cautious. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might have been more comfortable using his own. But in relationships, mutual respect is important. If the girl is clear that she won't proceed unless she uses her own condom, is it his right to walk out? Or is it his responsibility to comply with her conditions? \n\nWait, the guy says he was scared. Maybe he didn't want to use her condom for health reasons. If he's concerned about her STI status, then insisting on using his own might be justified. But in a committed relationship, you'd expect both partners to be open about their health status. If they're in a new relationship (3-4 weeks), maybe that's a different story. \n\nThe girl is asking him to use her condom, which could mean she's not comfortable with him using his own. But if he's bringing up his own, maybe he's assuming that's the standard. However, the fact that she's insisting might mean she's not in the mood for protection, which could be related to her wanting to conceive soon. If she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she was trying to have unprotected sex to get pregnant, and he was okay with that in the future but not yet. \n\nBut he thought she wanted to just mess around for a few weeks. So there's a misunderstanding here. She might have wanted to try to get pregnant now, while he expected to use protection. If that's the case, then refusing to use her condom could be because he doesn't want to get her pregnant yet. But she's the one who mentioned wanting kids soon, so perhaps she's ready to stop using protection. \n\nIn that case, if the guy is not ready to have kids yet, but she is, there's a conflict. If he's not on birth control and she's not, then using her condom would prevent pregnancy. Wait, no\u2014if she's using a condom, that's to prevent pregnancy. But if she wants kids soon, maybe she's off birth control and wants to conceive, so using a condom would block that. So maybe she was lying about using her own condom, and actually wanted to have unprotected sex. That would be a problem because if he's not ready, he's risking pregnancy. \n\nBut the guy might be confused here. If she said she has condoms, but her intention is to have unprotected sex, that's a red flag. Alternatively, she might just prefer her own brand or method. \n\nSo the guy's action was to leave because she wouldn't let him use his own. Is that wrong? If he's uncomfortable with her condom, maybe he's within his right to not proceed. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, and he's walking out, maybe that's a valid choice. \n\nBut in a relationship, communication is key. If she's insistent, maybe they should have discussed it beforehand. The fact that she made him leave might be her being controlling, but the guy's concern could be valid if he's worried about her health or pregnancy. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girl's friend called him an asshole, implying that he shouldn't have left. But if the girl was pressuring him to use her condom without his consent, maybe he did the right thing. However, if using a condom is a mutual agreement, and he's not willing to use hers, then maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nWait, but the guy had his own. She said no to his, so he's not using any. But if she's insistent, maybe she's not okay with him using his own. So if they can't agree, not proceeding is better. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on protection. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not allowing him to make his own choice. Alternatively, if he's insistent on using his own, maybe he's not respecting her. \n\nBut the key point is mutual consent. If the guy is okay with using her condom, then maybe he should. But if he's not, then he should not proceed. Since he left, maybe he's in the right. But if she's pressuring him, that's her issue. \n\nThe answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he chose not to comply with her demand and left, which is his right if he's uncomfortable. However, if using a condom is a mutual agreement and he's refusing, that's another angle. But since she's the one who changed her mind at the last moment, maybe he was right to leave.\n"
