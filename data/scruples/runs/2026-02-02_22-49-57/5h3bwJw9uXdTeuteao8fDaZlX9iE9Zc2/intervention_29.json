Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over using a condom. The author had brought their own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author left and now feels second-guessed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author came prepared with a condom, which is responsible behavior. The girlfriend wanted to use hers instead and was firm about it. The author refused and left. Now, the question is whether not using their own condom and complying with the girlfriend's request would have been the right move.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is a personal choice and a way to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancies. If the author is not on birth control or doesn't want to risk pregnancy, using a condom is important. However, the girlfriend mentioned wanting to have kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control and trusts that. But even then, STI protection is still a valid reason for using a condom.\n\nThe girlfriend's insistence on her own condom might be about trust or preference. However, if the author felt uncomfortable using her condom because they didn't know its source or condition (like if it was expired or not properly stored), that's a valid concern. The author might not want to use a condom that isn't their own, especially if they can't verify its safety.\n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual agreement. If both parties agree to use a condom, it's a mutual decision. If one party insists and the other refuses, it's a disagreement. The author's choice to leave might be about respecting their own boundaries. But the girlfriend's reaction, including the friend calling the author an asshole, suggests she felt disrespected or misunderstood.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author took initiative by bringing their own condom. The girlfriend's refusal might be based on her own preferences, but the author has the right to use their own protection. If they had used her condom, maybe there would be no issue, but the author's discomfort with not knowing the condition of her condom could be a factor.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a responsible choice by having a condom and tried to use it. The girlfriend's insistence might not have been reasonable if the author had valid concerns about the alternative. The key is mutual consent and understanding. Since the author left rather than compromise, but also didn't push back aggressively, it seems like they were respecting their own boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
