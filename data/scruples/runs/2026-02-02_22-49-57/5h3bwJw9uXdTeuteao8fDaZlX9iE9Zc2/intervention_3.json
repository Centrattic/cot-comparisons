Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't. He ended up not using any and left, then got criticized by her friend. The user is leaning towards the author not being wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Condom use should be a mutual decision. The guy brought his own, which shows he was prepared to protect against STIs and pregnancy. However, the girlfriend insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the interaction if he didn't comply. That's a power dynamic issue. She's pressuring him to use her condom against his initial preference, which might not be healthy.\n\nBut then, the guy didn't end up using a condom at all because he left. So he didn't put himself at risk. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but also wanted to have sex without his condom could be a red flag. Maybe she wanted to get pregnant, but he wasn't ready? Or maybe she was using the condom as a way to control the situation. \n\nThe key points here are: 1. The guy was prepared with his own condom, 2. The girlfriend insisted on using hers and made it a condition, 3. He left without using any, 4. Her friend called him an asshole for not complying.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important. If he was okay with using hers, maybe there's an issue with not checking if her condom was safe. But he didn't use one, so he avoided that. However, walking away might be the right choice if she was pressuring him. Also, if she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she's not being honest about her intentions, which could be a problem in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy did what he thought was right by bringing a condom. When she refused his and insisted on hers, he felt scared and left. It's possible that her behavior was controlling, and he was justified in not proceeding without a condom. On the other hand, maybe he should've communicated better or checked if her condom was safe. But she was the one being persistent and making it a deal-breaker. So maybe he's not in the wrong for leaving. The friend calling him an asshole seems to be on her side, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is about mutual consent and respecting boundaries. Since he didn't engage in unsafe sex and left when she was being controlling, he's probably not wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
