Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple about to have sex, and the man brought his own condom, but the woman insists on using hers. She even threatens to leave if he doesn't. He refuses and leaves. Her friend calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Consent and mutual agreement are crucial in any sexual activity. Using a condom is a shared responsibility, and both partners should have a say. The woman's insistence might be about her comfort level, maybe she prefers her own or wants to ensure it's her choice. But the man had his own ready. Did he respect her boundaries? When she said no to his condom, he tried to proceed, but she became more insistent. He then refused to use hers. Wait, the man initially wanted to use his own, but she said no. He continued to unwrap it, then she insisted she had hers. He didn't want to use hers, so he left.\n\nWait, the man had his own condom, but the woman said no and wanted to use hers. The man then tried to use his own, but she refused and said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He said no and left. So he didn't use either. But the problem is, he was prepared with his own, but she didn't want that. He was insistent on using his own, which she didn't want. She set the boundary, and he didn't respect it by not using hers. Even though he had his own, she had her own reasons (maybe trusting hers, or maybe she had a preference). By not using hers, even though he had his own, he was disregarding her terms. However, he did stop when she said no, so maybe he's not the wrongdoer. But the key is that he didn't use any condom. Wait, no\u2014the situation says that he had his own, but she refused it. So he left without using a condom. So he didn't have sex, but he also didn't use the condom she provided. So he left. But he had his own, but she didn't want that. So maybe he's not wrong because he respected her when she said to use hers, but he didn't want to. Wait, no, the man initially tried to use his own, but she refused. Then he tried to proceed with his own, but she refused again. Then he left. So he didn't use either. But he had the option of using hers. However, in the scenario, he didn't. So maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundary of using her condom. Alternatively, if he had agreed to use hers, that would have been the respectful action. But he was insistent on using his own. So by not using hers, he was not respecting her terms. Hence, he's in the wrong. But maybe the woman was being controlling. However, consent requires both parties to agree. If she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used her condom, and he didn't, he didn't have sex. So he wasn't wrong in that sense. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the details. The man had his own condom. She said no to his and insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, she refused, then he left. So he didn't have sex. The question is, is he in the wrong for not using her condom when she insisted? The answer depends on whether respecting her boundary is necessary. If she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he didn't, he didn't have sex. So he didn't force it. But he didn't use her condom either. So he could be seen as not respecting her terms. However, he had his own, which he was willing to use, but she refused. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he had his own and she was being unreasonable. Alternatively, maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't use the condom at all. Wait, no\u2014he was about to use his own but she stopped him. So he didn't use any. But in that case, he didn't proceed with sex without a condom, so he didn't have sex. So he's not the one who forced it. Hmm. The key is whether he respected her boundary. She said \"no\" to his condom and insisted on hers. He didn't use hers, so he didn't respect her boundary. Therefore, he's in the wrong. But maybe the woman was being unreasonable. However, in consensual situations, both partners need to agree on terms. If she set a boundary and he didn't respect it, then he's at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
