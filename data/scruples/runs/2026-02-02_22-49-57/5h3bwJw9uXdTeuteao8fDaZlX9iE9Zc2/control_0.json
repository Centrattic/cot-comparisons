Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not using their girlfriend's condom. They had their own, but she insisted on using hers. The key points here are consent, communication, and safety.\n\nFirst, using a condom is important for preventing pregnancy and STIs. If the woman is planning to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not on birth control, so the condom is a must. But why did she bring up using hers? Maybe she prefers her brand or there's another reason.\n\nThe user had their own condom, but she refused. He tried to use his, she wouldn't let him. He left because he wasn't comfortable using hers. Now he's confused because her friend called him an asshole. \n\nSo, who's at fault? If he's not comfortable using her condom for any reason (maybe he's worried about STIs or there's a history of something), then leaving might be his right. But if she's healthy and he trusts her, maybe he overreacted. But the fact that he had his own and she made him use hers could be about control or maybe she's also concerned about STIs. \n\nWait, he thought she wanted to maybe just mess around for a week. Maybe he was uncertain about commitment, but she wanted to take the next step. If he's not ready to use her condom, maybe he's not ready for that level of intimacy. Or maybe she's trying to push him into a commitment he's not ready for. \n\nBut the main issue is consent. If she said no to his condom and he left, is that his choice? He has the right to refuse a condom he's uncomfortable with. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers, maybe there's an underlying issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate. If he wanted to use a condom and she wouldn't let him, maybe he's in the right for not compromising his safety. But if she's also using protection, maybe his hesitation is unfounded. \n\nI think the key here is that he had his own and she wanted hers. If he left because he's not comfortable using hers, that's his choice. But maybe he should have discussed it more. However, the fact that he was scared and left shows he's prioritizing his own boundaries. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If she's insistent and he leaves, maybe not. But if she's trying to control the situation and he's standing his ground, he's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
