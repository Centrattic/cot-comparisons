Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy went over to his girlfriend's place with a condom he brought. They were planning to have sex. When he tried to use his own, she insisted on using hers and even refused to proceed unless he used her condom. He ended up leaving because he wasn't comfortable with that. Now he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole, and he's questioning his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. Both parties should be comfortable with the method of protection. The guy had his own condom, which is responsible, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. In some cases, people may prefer using their own for various reasons, like familiarity or control. But if the guy is uncomfortable with that, he has the right to not proceed, right? Using a condom is a mutual decision, and both should agree on it.\n\nWait, but the girlfriend said she wouldn't let him use his own and made it a condition. That seems like she's pressuring him to use her method. But if he doesn't feel comfortable, walking away is his choice. However, the problem is whether he was wrong for not respecting her preference. But he might have valid reasons, like not trusting her condoms' source or not wanting to use them. If there's no discussion about STI risks or other concerns, it's hard to say who's wrong.\n\nBut the main issue here is consent. If she's refusing to use his condom and he's not willing to use hers, then neither should proceed. The guy walked away, which is a responsible action. The friend calling him an asshole might indicate that she didn't handle the situation well. But the guy's right to set boundaries is important. So, he's not in the wrong for leaving. Answer B.\n"
