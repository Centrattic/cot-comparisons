Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves him bringing his own condom, but his girlfriend insisting on using hers. He mentions that she even said he should leave if he didn't use hers. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy. Using a condom is a personal choice, and both parties should have a say. However, the girlfriend here is making a firm demand, not just a preference. The author refused to use hers and left, but the question is whether that refusal makes him wrong.\n\nHe had his own condom ready, which shows he was prepared. Her insistence might be about control or other reasons. The key point is that using a condom is a mutual decision. If she's refusing to use his and insisting on hers, maybe there's an issue with trust or her own preparedness. But if she's okay with using a condom, then the choice of which one to use shouldn't matter that much. However, if she's not using a condom at all, that's a different scenario. Wait, in the story, he starts to unwrap his, she says no and insists on hers. So he doesn't end up using any, right? Wait, no\u2014wait, he says he had his own, but she wanted to use hers. He didn't end up using hers because he left. So maybe the main issue is that he didn't use a condom at all. But the problem is that she wanted to use hers, maybe because she has STIs or pregnancy concerns. If he was okay with using hers, but she wanted to use hers for a reason, then refusing to use any might be the issue. But the story is a bit unclear. Wait, he had his own, she wanted hers. He didn't use hers because he left. So maybe the confusion is about why he didn't compromise. If she wanted to use hers, maybe he should have used hers instead of bringing his own. But he was prepared with his own, maybe for safety. However, if she's okay with using a condom, then the choice of whose to use should be a mutual decision. The fact that she refused to use his might indicate that she has a preference, maybe because she has STIs and doesn't want to share. In that case, using her condom could be a health risk for him. But if she's not using a condom at all, then that's a different problem. The story is a bit confusing. The main point is that he had his own, she insisted on hers, he left. The friend called him an asshole, which adds to the conflict. So, was he wrong to refuse to use hers? From a health perspective, using any condom is better than none. But if the condom she has is not his, maybe there's a reason. But if she's insistent and he leaves, maybe he's overreacting. Alternatively, if she's pressuring him to use hers without understanding his reasons for bringing his own, that's a problem. The key is mutual consent and communication. Since he left, maybe he respected his own boundaries, but if she was insistent and he didn't compromise, maybe he's in the wrong. However, using a condom is a personal choice, and she can't force him to use hers. But he also can't force her to use his. The problem is that he didn't use any condom. So, depending on the context, if they were not using a condom at all, that's risky. But if he had his own, and she wanted to use hers, maybe the issue is about control. The answer might hinge on whether using a condom is necessary. If they were not using a condom, then he's in the wrong for not using any. If he was using a condom but just chose his own, then it's a different scenario. The story says he started to unwrap his, she said no, and he left. So he didn't use any condom. If that's the case, then not using a condom at all is the issue. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not using a condom, regardless of whose it was. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his own, which he didn't do because she refused. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he didn't use hers, but he also didn't use his own. The confusion is whether using any condom is better. In that case, he's in the wrong for not using any. But if he was trying to use his own and she refused, leading to no condom use, then he's in the wrong for not compromising. Alternatively, if he left because she was being controlling, maybe he's not wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. The main point is that using a condom is important for both STI and pregnancy prevention. If she's trying to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using a condom, which complicates things. But the story says she wanted to use hers, which might be because she's on birth control and wants to avoid STIs. In that case, using hers would be better. If he refused and left, maybe he's being overly cautious. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong for not using a condom, even if it's hers. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
