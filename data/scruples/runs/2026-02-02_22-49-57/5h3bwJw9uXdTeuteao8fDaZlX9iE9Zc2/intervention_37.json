Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom instead of their own. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy went over to his girlfriend, they were about to have sex. He brought his own condoms. When he tried to use his, she insisted on using hers. He had mentioned earlier that she wanted to have kids soon, but he thought maybe they'd just mess around for a bit. Now, he's confused and scared because she's being persistent and even threatens to make him leave if he doesn't use hers. He ends up leaving, and then her friend texts him calling him an asshole. He's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. The main issue is consent and the use of contraception. The guy had his own condom ready, but she insisted on using hers. He refused and left. Now, in terms of responsibility regarding STI prevention and pregnancy, condoms are a shared responsibility. Both parties should have a say in what's used. But if one party brings their own and the other insists on using theirs, it's a matter of mutual agreement.\n\nWait, the user says the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. That's interesting because if she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So why is she insisting on using her own? Maybe she's not ready to get pregnant yet, or maybe she has a different plan. There's a contradiction here: wanting to have kids soon but not wanting to use a condom. That could be a red flag. The guy might be confused because he thought they were on the same page, but she's being insistent. \n\nBut from a standard of consent and respect, both should agree on the method of contraception. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, but he's okay with his own, it's about mutual agreement. However, if using her condom is a deal-breaker for her, and he's unwilling to comply, then it's a matter of boundaries. \n\nIn terms of health and safety, using a condom is important for both STI prevention and pregnancy control. If she's against using his condom, maybe she's concerned about STIs, or maybe there's another reason. But if he's bringing his own and she's refusing, maybe there's a lack of communication. \n\nThe guy left because she said to leave if he didn't use hers. Is that right? If someone is in a relationship and refuses to compromise, maybe that's an issue. But walking away from a situation where you're uncomfortable is also a valid choice. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole is probably because the girl was upset. But does that mean he was wrong? Not necessarily. It's a judgment call. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key factors are consent, communication, and health. If he's not comfortable using her condom, he has the right to leave. However, if she's in a hurry to have kids, why is she using a condom at all? That's conflicting. \n\nBut the main point is that the author didn't use his own condom because she refused, which is why he left. So, in terms of responsibility, if he's okay with using her condom, but she's not with his, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the standard practice is that both should be on the same page. If she's insistent and he's not, he's within his rights to walk away. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends. If he's choosing to avoid using a condom when she wants to use one, maybe that's a problem for pregnancy/STI prevention. But if he's uncomfortable with using hers, then he's not at fault. However, since he had his own and she refused, and he left, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if she's pressuring him to use her condom for a reason (like STI testing, etc.), but he's not agreeing, maybe that's a mutual issue. But since the guy left, he's asserting his own boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's respecting his own boundaries and the communication breakdown is on her side. However, if the issue is about health and safety, he might be in the wrong for not using a condom. But since she's the one not allowing his, and he's leaving, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, the standard is that both partners should agree on the method. If he brings his own and she insists on hers, maybe the problem is her being controlling. But if he's okay with using hers, then that's fine. However, he walked away because she wouldn't let him use his. So, he's not wrong for walking away. \n\nSo, the answer is B.\n"
