Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers. He ended up not having sex and now someone is calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The guy had his own condom ready. The girl said they could use hers, but he wanted to use his. She then became persistent and even said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. He respected her wishes and left. Now her friend is upset with him.\n\nFrom a consent and safety perspective, using a condom is important for both parties. However, the girl might have had her own reasons for preferring hers. Maybe she's more familiar with her own, or perhaps there's another reason. But the guy had the right to prefer his own. However, when a partner sets a boundary, it's important to respect it. In this case, the girl was clear and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't comply. The guy left, which shows he respected her boundary. \n\nBut wait, maybe the issue is that he was willing to bring up the condom but she didn't want to use any? No, he had his own, but she insisted on hers. He tried to use his, but she refused. He was trying to be responsible. However, in consensual situations, both parties need to agree. If she was adamant and he left, then he wasn't pressuring her. It seems like he made a choice to respect her wishes, even though he was uncomfortable. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is that he didn't use any condom at all? No, he had one, but she refused. He didn't use either. So there was no actual sexual contact. If she wanted to use hers but he was okay with that, why did he protest? Wait, he didn't protest, he was going to use his own, but she wanted hers. Maybe he was just following through with his own plan, but she was insistent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should be on the same page. If she's not okay with his condom, maybe she should have brought hers earlier. But he had his own. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether he was wrong for not using hers. If he left and didn't proceed, then he wasn't in the wrong. However, if he had pressured her to not use his, that would be different. Since he left, it seems he was respecting her boundary. But maybe the issue is that he didn't communicate better? Or maybe the girl was being unreasonable?\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole is confusing. Maybe the friend thought he was being selfish. But if the girl set the boundary and he respected it, then he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B, No, he's not in the wrong because he respected her wishes and left.\n"
