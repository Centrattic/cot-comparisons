Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is about to have sex. The man brought his own condom, but the woman insists on using hers. He was prepared, but she's not letting him use his. She mentions wanting kids soon, which is a bit confusing because using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The man goes along with her choice but later feels conflicted and leaves. Then her friend texts him calling him an asshole.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety. Both condoms are presumably safe, so the main issue might be preference. But the woman is adamant about using hers. The man's decision to not use hers and leave could be seen as respecting his own boundaries, especially if he's uncomfortable. However, if she's insistent and he's okay with using hers, maybe he should comply. But the woman's mention of wanting kids in two months is conflicting. If she wants to conceive, why use a condom? Maybe she's not on the pill or wants to track ovulation, so using her own condoms might be part of that plan. The man might not have considered this, leading to confusion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. If the woman is pressuring him to use her condom and he's uncomfortable, he's not in the wrong for not complying. But if he agreed to use hers without a problem, then leaving might be an overreaction. However, the key point here is that he initially brought his own and she insisted on hers. If he's okay with using hers, maybe he should have. But since he felt scared and left, it's a personal choice. The friend calling him an asshole might be overstepping, but the main question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn many cases, using the partner's condom is okay, but if there's a reason (like wanting to conceive), then the man's initial preparation might be conflicting. The woman's insistence could be about control or specific needs. The author's decision to leave because he didn't want to use hers might be his right, but he should communicate better. However, the situation is a bit murky because of the conflicting information about wanting kids. The answer might depend on whether using her condom would actually help her conceive, which the man might not have considered. If he's not on board with her plans for pregnancy, maybe he should have discussed it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the man might be in the wrong if he's aware of her desire to have kids soon and still insists on using his own condom. But if he's not on the same page and she's pressuring him without explaining her reasons, then he's not in the wrong for not complying. The key here is communication. The author might have made a mistake by not discussing her intent to conceive and the role of the condom. But in terms of the immediate act, if he's uncomfortable and leaves, he's not necessarily wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
