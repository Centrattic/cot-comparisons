Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl refusing to use the author's condom and insisting on using her own. The author tried to use one they brought, but she was persistent and even made him leave when he refused. Her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just \"mess around for a week or two\" before that. So maybe she's not ready for pregnancy yet. She might be using condoms to prevent pregnancy but wants to use her own for some reason, maybe brand preference, control, or another reason. The author came with his own, which she didn't want him to use. He was scared she might be pushing for unprotected sex, so he left. \n\nNow, considering consent and boundaries. Both parties should have the right to agree on the terms of sexual activity. If she's insistent on using her condom and he's uncomfortable, he's within his rights to refuse. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers because she wants to have sex without a condom (maybe she's on birth control or other reasons), then he might be right to be cautious. But the key here is mutual consent. If she refused to engage unless he used her condom, and he felt scared, leaving was his choice. But if she's insistent on using her own, maybe she's in control of her own health, so he might not be wrong to leave. \n\nAnother angle: bringing your own condoms is standard, but if she's providing hers, maybe there's an issue with her condoms being expired or not safe. The author might be right to be cautious. However, if she's just being controlling, then he's justified. The problem is that the woman is asserting her choice, but the author is also asserting his. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should check each other's condoms for safety. But if she's pressuring him to use hers against his will, that could be a red flag. The author's fear might be valid. Also, her friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe the situation wasn't handled well. \n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for not using her condom? If she's refusing to use his, but he's uncomfortable, then he's not wrong to leave. But if she's in control of her own health and wants to use hers, he might be overstepping. However, since he was scared and left, it's more about his discomfort. The answer depends on whose health is at risk. If he's not using his own due to her request, but he's respecting her choice, then he's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him into using hers for unsafe reasons, he's right to leave. Since the situation is a bit ambiguous, but the author made a choice to leave, which is his right, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
