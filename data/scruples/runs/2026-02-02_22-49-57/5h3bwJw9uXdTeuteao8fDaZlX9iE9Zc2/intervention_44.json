Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy went over to his girlfriend, and they were planning to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to use her condom, maybe because she mentioned wanting kids soon. But he didn't agree and left. Then her friend texted him calling him an asshole.\n\nHmm, so first, consent is a big part of this. Using a condom is about protection and preventing pregnancy. The girl had mentioned wanting kids soon, which is a bit confusing. If she wants kids, maybe she's not using birth control, so using a condom would be important. But she's bringing her own, so maybe she's okay with using one but prefers hers. However, the guy brought his own and tried to use it, but she didn't want that.\n\nWait, why would she care which condom they use? Maybe there's a personal preference, like brand or type, but that seems trivial. The main point is mutual agreement on using protection. The guy thought she wanted to use hers, but he was okay with using his. When she said she wouldn't let him have sex unless he used hers, he refused and left. \n\nIs there a wrong here? If she's insistent on using her own condom, maybe there's an issue with control or pressure. But if the guy is uncomfortable with that, he has the right to leave. However, if she was trying to ensure protection and he was willing to use a condom, then maybe he should have gone along with hers. But maybe he's just not comfortable with that. \n\nWait, the guy mentioned he was scared. Maybe he felt pressured. The key is consent and mutual comfort. If she was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt that was a dealbreaker, then leaving might be his choice. But if he was using a condom, which she was okay with, but just wanted to use hers, then technically he's not in the wrong because he's using protection. However, if her insistence was manipulative or controlling, that's another matter. \n\nAlso, the fact that she said if he didn't use hers, he should leave, which is a form of pressure. The guy's choice to leave because he wasn't comfortable with that pressure isn't wrong. But maybe he should have considered that she wanted to use her own for a reason, like maybe she already had her partner's condoms or something. \n\nBut the main thing is that using a condom is a mutual decision. If she was okay with using a condom in general, then the fact that he used his own shouldn't be an issue. However, she might have had a reason to prefer her own, like maybe she had a specific type, or she wanted to make sure it was one she had tested or something. But that's speculative. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is using a condom, which is responsible. He's not refusing protection. The issue is about whose condom to use, which is a minor detail. By refusing to use hers and leaving, he's not being irresponsible. But maybe he could have compromised more. However, if she was pressuring him, he had the right to leave. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's using a condom, and if the pressure from her was uncomfortable, leaving was a valid choice.\n"
