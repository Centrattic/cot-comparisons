Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. He ended up leaving, and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The guy had his own condom, which he brought prepared. The girl didn't want to use his and insisted on hers. He thought she might be trying to get pregnant soon and thought she was just messing around, but she was serious. He complied with her demand, but then her friend was upset about it. The guy is now questioning if he was wrong to leave.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the girl is the one who insists on using her own, maybe she has her own reasons. But if the guy's condom was already prepared, maybe there's a trust issue here. However, the girl's insistence to the point of threatening to end the encounter if he didn't use hers could be a red flag. Coercion in any form is a problem. If she was pressuring him to use her condom instead of his own, that might be an issue. \n\nAlso, if she wants to conceive soon, using a condom at all would prevent pregnancy. So maybe there's a mismatch in their intentions. If he thought they were just messing around for a week or two and she wanted to get pregnant, that's conflicting. But the main issue here is the condom choice. \n\nIs it wrong for the guy to have used his own condom? No, because he came prepared. But if the girl is insistent on using hers, why is that a problem? Unless there's a reason to distrust her, like if she's using a faulty condom or trying to get pregnant without his knowledge. In that case, using his own would be the safer choice. However, if she's being controlling or manipulative about it, that's another issue. \n\nThe girl's friend calling him an asshole might indicate that her friend doesn't support her actions. Maybe the friend thinks the guy was just trying to do the right thing by using a condom. The friend's reaction could be a sign that the girl's behavior isn't socially accepted. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? If he left because she was pressuring him to use her condom, which could be a safety issue, then he's not wrong for leaving. If the girl was being manipulative or trying to get him to use a defective condom, that's a big red flag. However, if the girl just prefers her own for comfort and the guy is okay with that, he should use hers. But in this case, since he had his own and she was being insistent, he chose to leave. That might be a sign of self-respect and prioritizing his safety. \n\nOn the other hand, if they're in a monogamous relationship and both are okay with using either's condom, maybe he should have gone along. But since she mentioned wanting kids soon, using a condom at all might not align with that. So maybe there's a bigger issue here about their intentions. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should be comfortable. If she's pressuring him, that's a problem. He has the right to use his own condom. So he's not wrong for standing his ground. The fact that her friend was upset might imply that her actions weren't appropriate. \n\nSo, considering all these angles, the guy might not be in the wrong. He was prepared, used his own condom as a precaution, and left when she refused. The girl's behavior was controlling, which is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
