Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the author brought his own, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers and even said he should leave if he didn't. He went along with it, but later regrets it, especially since she mentioned wanting kids soon. \n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Using a condom is a personal choice, and both parties should agree on which one to use. The girlfriend's insistence to the point of threatening to end the encounter might be a red flag. She has a right to her preferences, but pressuring someone to the point of refusal could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the author's hesitation might stem from his own boundaries. He had a valid reason to prefer his own condom, maybe due to safety concerns or personal preference. Forcing the use of her condom without mutual agreement could be seen as a violation of his autonomy. \n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole complicates things. It suggests that maybe the girlfriend's actions were perceived as unreasonable by others. However, the key point is whether the author was in the wrong for not complying. If the situation escalated to the point where she wouldn't engage unless he used hers, then his decision to leave might be seen as standing by his own boundaries.\n\nIn terms of responsibility for STI prevention, both should have discussed this beforehand. If the author was concerned about her STI status or her sudden change of mind about using his condom, that's a valid concern. But if he had already discussed and agreed to use hers, then not using it might be the issue. However, the scenario shows she insisted last-minute, which might not have been a consensual agreement.\n\nSo, considering consent, mutual agreement, and personal boundaries, the author's decision to leave when she wouldn't compromise could be seen as standing up for his own safety. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong.\n"

  "answer": "B",
  "full_response": "B \n\nThe author is not in the wrong. Consent requires mutual agreement, and the girlfriend's insistence to the point of coercion undermines consensual decision-making. The author\u2019s refusal to use her condom and his choice to leave when she refused to compromise reflects his right to set boundaries. Prior discussions about contraceptive preferences and STI risks should ideally occur before such situations, but the pressure to use her condom without prior agreement raises concerns about respect for autonomy.",
