Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on hers instead of his.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The guy brought his own condom, started to use it, but the girl refused and wanted to use hers. She even said not to proceed unless he used hers. He refused and left. Now, the question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nHmm. Condom use is about safety, right? Both parties should agree on the method of protection. If the girl is okay with using the man's condom, then he's using his own is fine. But she wanted to use hers. Maybe there's a reason she prefers hers? Like maybe she's on birth control but still uses condoms, or maybe she prefers a different brand for comfort or trust. \n\nBut the problem here is that he had already brought his own, and she's insisting on hers. Maybe there's a communication issue. If she had mentioned earlier that she preferred hers, maybe he could have used both or checked them together. But he started unwrapping his, and she changed her mind. \n\nWait, the user says the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to conceive, maybe she's not on birth control and relies on condoms. But if she's not using her own, maybe she's not as prepared. But why would she refuse his? Could be a trust issue? Or maybe she wants to ensure she's using her own for some reason, like she's more familiar with them. \n\nAnother angle: condom use is a mutual decision. If she insists on using hers, and he insists on his, that's a problem. But in this case, he had already brought his, which is responsible. However, she's the one who's now refusing. Maybe he should have asked why she wanted to use hers. Maybe there was a reason, like she's concerned about STIs if he's not using hers. But that's speculative. \n\nThe key point is consent and mutual agreement. If she's not allowing him to use his own, but he's not willing to use hers, then he's not agreeing to her terms. But if he's not using a condom at all, that's risky. However, in this case, he didn't proceed without a condom; he left instead. So he didn't engage in unprotected sex. \n\nBut why wouldn't she let him use his own? Maybe she feels that using his condom means she's not in control or there's an underlying issue. Maybe she's trying to establish boundaries. If he's okay with using hers, then that's a solution. If he refuses and leaves, it's his choice, but maybe he could have communicated better. \n\nThe friend called him an asshole. Maybe the girl's friend thinks he was being too rigid. But from the guy's perspective, he brought a condom, which is responsible. The girl's insistence might be overstepping. However, if the girl is the one who set the condition for using hers, and he won't comply, then maybe he's not wrong to leave. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the guy didn't force her to use his, and he didn't proceed without her agreement. He left when she said to. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of respecting her preference. However, since he was prepared and she changed her mind, maybe he's justified in standing his ground. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have compromised. But if he's not comfortable using her condom for some reason (like not knowing if it's expired or not), that's a valid concern. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because he was prepared, tried to use a condom, and left when she refused his, rather than proceeding without agreement. It's more about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries, which he did by not continuing.\n"
