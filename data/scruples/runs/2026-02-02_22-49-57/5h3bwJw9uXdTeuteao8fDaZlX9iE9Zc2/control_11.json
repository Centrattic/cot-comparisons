Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy brought his own condom, and the girl refused to use it, insisting on using hers. She even threatened to have him leave if he didn't use hers. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the issue of consent and safety. The guy had his own condom, which is good. But when the girl refused to use it, that might be a problem. If she's the one who's not using protection, maybe there's a risk of pregnancy or STIs. But she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control? Wait, if she's trying to get pregnant, then using a condom would prevent that. But why did she push so hard to use her own? Maybe there's another reason. Did she have her own for safety, or maybe she wanted to use a specific type?\n\nThe guy's actions: he didn't use his own. He left because she refused. He didn't proceed without protection. That seems responsible. But she was insistent, and he ended the encounter. However, her friend's reaction is calling him an asshole, which might imply that the girl's side of the story is different. Maybe there's a cultural or social norm here that the guy is violating by not using her condom. But why would she not accept his? Maybe she felt it was her choice, or perhaps there's an underlying issue like she's not on birth control, and using hers would be for protection while he uses his for something else. Wait, no\u2014if she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would block that. So maybe she's not on birth control and wanted to use her condom to avoid pregnancy, but he's using his for STI protection. But then, if he's using his own, why is she refusing? That's confusing.\n\nAnother angle: the guy might have felt pressured but chose to leave, which is a good sign. However, by not using his own, he might be not respecting his own boundaries. Or maybe the girl was pressuring him to use hers for her own safety. But if she's the one who wants kids soon, using her own condom would prevent pregnancy. That seems contradictory. Maybe the situation is more complex. The guy is in a new relationship, and the girl's behavior might be manipulative or controlling. Alternatively, she might have her own reasons for using her condom that he's not considering. But he's the one who brought his own and she's refusing. The guy left, so he didn't engage without protection. But the question is whether not using his own makes him wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a shared responsibility. If she insists on using hers, maybe it's better to comply if she's not on birth control. But if he's uncomfortable, leaving is a valid choice. However, the fact that he had his own and she refused might mean he's not taking her safety into account. Wait, but if he uses his own, he's protecting himself. If she uses hers, he's protecting her. So if she's not on birth control, using hers would protect her from pregnancy, but he's using his for STIs. But if they're not using protection, then both are at risk. \n\nThe guy left, so he didn't proceed without protection. But the question is about whether not using his own makes him wrong. If the girl is pressuring him to use hers for her own reasons (maybe she's on birth control and wants to use her own for STI protection), then using hers might be okay. But he's not sure. Since he's not using his own, maybe he's not protecting himself. But she's not using hers either. Wait, the guy left, so he never actually used a condom. The problem is that the girl wouldn't let him use his own, so he left. The guy is not in the wrong for not using his own because he was refused. But she might have her own reasons. However, the friend's reaction suggests that maybe there's a misunderstanding. The guy is in a new relationship and might not know her medical situation. Since he left, he didn't proceed, so maybe he's not at fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own. Since he had his own and she refused, and he chose not to use hers, maybe he's in the right for not proceeding without protection. Alternatively, the girl's refusal might be an issue. The answer might depend on whose responsibility it is to use protection. In many cases, mutual agreement is needed. If he's not using his own because she's refusing, and he leaves, he's not at fault. So answer B for No.\n"
