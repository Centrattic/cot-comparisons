Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He didn't want to, so he left. The friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The guy had his own, which is good. But the girl wanted to use hers. Maybe she had a reason, like preferring her own or maybe something else. However, if she was pressuring him to use her condom, that could be an issue. But if he felt uncomfortable, he had the right to say no. \n\nWait, the article mentions that she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning pregnancy, maybe using a condom isn't necessary if they're trying to conceive. But the guy might not be ready, so he's using protection. But she's saying to use hers, implying maybe that she trusts her own or perhaps they are trying to get pregnant. \n\nBut the problem here is whether the guy is at fault for not using her condom. If he had his own, why didn't he use it? Maybe he was uncomfortable with hers. But the key is that he had the right to choose his own. However, if she was pressuring him and made it a condition, that could be a power imbalance. But if he left because he wasn't comfortable, maybe that's his right. \n\nBut the friend called him an asshole. Is that a red flag? Maybe the friend is overreacting. But if the girl was being controlling, that's another issue. The guy's main issue was that he was scared and left. \n\nFrom a consent perspective, both parties should agree on the use of contraception. If the guy had his own, he's responsible for his own safety. She shouldn't have forced him to use hers. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. He brought his own, tried to use it, she refused, he left. That's his right. So answer B.\n"
