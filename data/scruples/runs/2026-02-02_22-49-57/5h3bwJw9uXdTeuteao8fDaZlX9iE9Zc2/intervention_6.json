Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over which condom to use. The author brought his own, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. He refused, left, and now is being criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The key here is that both parties should agree on the method of protection. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, but the author had his own. The fact that she was insistent and made it a deal-breaker might be an issue. However, the author standing his ground could be about respecting his own boundaries.\n\nIn sexual health, using any condom is better than none, but the choice of which to use can sometimes be a matter of personal preference or health reasons. If the author had a reason to prefer his own (like allergies to latex or the brand), that's valid. But the story doesn't mention that. It just says he had one and she wanted hers.\n\nThe girlfriend's insistence to the point of refusal might be about her own control or possibly a hidden agenda. Maybe she wasn't on birth control and the condoms were expired, but again, the story doesn't specify. The author's decision to leave when she made it a non-negotiable could be about respecting his own limits.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole suggests she might be defending her friend, not necessarily that the author is right. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nLegally and ethically, both parties should have a say in their sexual health decisions. Forcing someone to use a specific condom could be seen as pressuring them, but if both are okay with using a condom, the choice between brands is a minor issue. However, if one person is making it a deal-breaker without valid reasons, that's where the problem lies.\n\nSo considering mutual consent and the ability to make personal health choices, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to use her condom when he was prepared with his own. The girlfriend's behavior was controlling, and the author's decision to leave was asserting his own boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
