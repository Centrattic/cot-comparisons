Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went over to his girlfriend and was ready to use his own condom. But the girlfriend insisted on using hers instead, and when he refused, she made him leave. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had his own condom, which is responsible. He wanted to use it, but the girlfriend was insistent on using hers. She even said he couldn't proceed unless he used hers, and when he refused, she made him leave. Now, the author is questioning if he should have gone along with her choice.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. The fact that the author had his own condom shows he was prepared. However, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which suggests she might not be using contraception otherwise. If she's okay with getting pregnant, then using her own condom might be unnecessary. But maybe she wants to avoid pregnancy for now and prefers her own method.\n\nThe conflict arises because both parties have different preferences. The author's choice to use his own condom is his right, as is her choice to prefer hers. However, when she made it conditional on using hers, that could be seen as pressure. But if the author refused and left, was that wrong?\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author might have thought that since she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's not using other forms of birth control, so using a condom would still be necessary. Alternatively, she might have her own reasons for preferring her condom (like brand preference, or maybe she's used to using her own).\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole is a red flag. It might indicate that the girlfriend's actions were manipulative or controlling. However, the author's decision to leave when she made it a non-negotiable condition was his right. Consent and mutual agreement are crucial. If she was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt uncomfortable, walking away was a valid choice.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he was prepared with a condom and chose not to use hers. Insisting on using one's own condom is a personal boundary, and the girlfriend overstepped by making it a deal-breaker. The friend's reaction might be more problematic than the author's decision.\n"
