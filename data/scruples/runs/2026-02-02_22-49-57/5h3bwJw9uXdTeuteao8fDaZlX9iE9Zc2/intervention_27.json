Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the situation) is in the wrong for not using their girlfriend's condom instead of their own. The situation involves the girlfriend insisting on using her own condom, even going as far as to refuse proceeding otherwise. The author is confused and now getting second thoughts after being called an asshole by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is consent and autonomy in sexual health. The author had their own condom prepared, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. The author refused and ended up leaving. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she wants to become pregnant, but the author wasn't on board with that plan yet. \n\nIn terms of condom use, the general principle is that both partners should have a say in how they protect themselves. However, if one partner is insistent on their own method and the other refuses, it can lead to conflict. The author's decision to leave might be seen as standing by their own choice, but the girlfriend's refusal to proceed unless her condom is used could be seen as exerting control over the situation, possibly to the point of pressuring or manipulating the outcome.\n\nHowever, from a health perspective, both condoms are effective, and using either should be safe. The real issue here might be about trust and communication. If the author didn't want to use the girlfriend's condom for a reason (maybe he didn't trust her to have a safe one, or he had his own for a reason), then his choice is valid. But if the girlfriend's insistence was about her desire to become pregnant, then the author's refusal might be about not wanting to risk unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern too.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own preparedness and safety. However, the girlfriend's behavior might be more concerning because she was coercive in her demands. The fact that her friend called the author an asshole adds another layer, suggesting maybe the social pressure is on her side, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. \n\nThe main question is whether the author had a right to use his own condom. Since both parties have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and sexual health, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing his own method. The girlfriend's refusal to proceed otherwise might be more about control rather than health concerns. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's decision to leave and not comply with using her condom isn't wrong. He's standing by his own choices and safety. Therefore, the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
