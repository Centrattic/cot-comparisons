Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He refused and left. Now he's wondering if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or is trying to conceive. However, the guy had his own condom ready. The woman refused his and demanded to use hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. He left and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nNow, from a relationship and communication perspective, consent and mutual agreement are crucial. Condom use is a shared decision, and both partners should have input. The woman's insistence on using her own condom could be for various reasons\u2014maybe she prefers a specific brand, has health concerns, or wants to ensure they use hers for tracking purposes. However, the guy had his own, which is also a valid position.\n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate this. The author's main point is that he was prepared and willing to use a condom, but the woman was insistent. He left because she wouldn't budge. The issue here is whether his refusal to use her condom was wrong.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about respecting boundaries. If the woman was uncomfortable with his condom for any reason (maybe she wanted to use a specific one, or there's a medical reason), then insisting on hers is her right. However, the guy also has the right to use his own, as long as they both agree. The problem arises when one partner pressures the other into a specific choice without mutual consent.\n\nThe woman's response of threatening to leave if he didn't use hers might be seen as manipulation or pressure. The guy's refusal could be seen as standing up for his own preparedness, but if the woman had valid reasons (like medical or health), then he might be in the wrong for not complying. However, the scenario doesn't mention any health issues or prior agreements about condom use.\n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole suggests that the woman might have communicated her stance strongly, possibly overreacting. The guy's decision to leave could be seen as standing his ground, but whether that's right depends on the context of their relationship and prior discussions. If they had talked about this before, it might be different. But given that they were only dating 3-4 weeks, maybe not.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should have discussed this before. The guy came prepared, the woman also had condoms. The conflict is about who uses which. The guy's choice to leave rather than comply might be seen as a firm stance, but if she was insistent, maybe he should have been more flexible. However, if she's the one who set the boundary, he's not wrong for not backing down on his own preparation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because both partners have the right to their own preferences, and the woman's refusal to use his condom without a clear reason (like health) doesn't make the guy wrong for leaving. It's more about mutual respect and communication.\n"
