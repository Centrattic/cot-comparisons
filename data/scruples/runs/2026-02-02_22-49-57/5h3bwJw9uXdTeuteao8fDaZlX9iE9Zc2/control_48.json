Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to have sex with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He thought she wanted to have kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a bit. He was scared and left when she got persistent. Now he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If she's saying she won't have sex unless he uses hers, that's her choice, but he has the right to set boundaries. However, if she's insistent and he backs down, that could be a red flag about her behavior.\n\nBut the man brought his own condom. She refuses it, insists on hers. He was scared and left. Is that a valid decision? Maybe she's pressuring him to use hers for a reason, like maybe she's not on birth control, or she's trying to conceive. But the guy might not be ready to have unprotected sex, especially if he's not on birth control. \n\nSo the question is, did he have the right to refuse? In terms of consent, both parties should agree on the terms. If she's pressuring him to use her condom instead of his own, maybe there's an issue with her being controlling or not respecting his preparedness. However, the guy also might have concerns about using someone else's condom without knowing their health status. But he's with his girlfriend, so maybe he trusts her. \n\nWait, the user says it's a girlfriend. So they're in a relationship. If they're planning to have kids soon, maybe using her condom is part of that plan. But the guy might be worried about STIs. However, if they're in a monogamous relationship and both tested, maybe that's not the issue. \n\nThe guy left, which shows he wasn't comfortable. But the girlfriend was insistent and maybe manipulative. The friend calling him an asshole adds to the pressure. So is he in the wrong for not using his own condom when she wanted hers? \n\nFrom a consent perspective, he has the right to bring his own and use it. Her refusal to use his could be a red flag. But he chose to leave instead of using hers. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he's setting a boundary. But if her intention was to get pregnant, and he's not ready for that, then she might be pressuring him into something he's not ready for. \n\nAlternatively, if he's not willing to use her condom, perhaps because he's not ready to have unprotected sex, that's his choice. She should respect that. So maybe the guy isn't in the wrong for leaving, and the girlfriend is being controlling by not allowing him to use his own. \n\nAnother angle: bringing a condom is a responsible action. Refusing to use it when the partner insists could be a sign of not respecting her autonomy. But if the guy is uncomfortable, he has the right to back out. \n\nBut the main issue is whether using the partner's condom is a reasonable request. If the partner wants to conceive, using her condom makes sense. However, the guy might have health concerns. But if they're in a trusting relationship, maybe that's not the case. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the key points are consent and mutual agreement. If the woman is pressuring him to use her condom and he's uncomfortable, he's in the right to leave. But if he's not in agreement with her request, he's not obligated to comply. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
