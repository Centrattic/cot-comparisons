Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over which condom to use during a sexual encounter with a new partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author went to his girlfriend (though they've only been talking for 3-4 weeks) and had a condom ready. The girl insisted on using hers and even threatened not to proceed if he didn't. The author left, and now he's feeling conflicted. His friend called him an asshole, making him doubt his decision.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual agreement in sexual activities, using a condom is a shared decision. Both partners should agree on the method of protection. The girl's insistence on her own condom could be about control, trust, or personal preference. But the author had his own, and she refused to proceed with his. \n\nFrom a health and safety standpoint, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancies. If the girl is planning to have kids soon, maybe she's not on birth control. However, the author might have concerns about her STI status if they haven't discussed it. \n\nThe author's choice to leave when she wouldn't agree to his condom shows he's prioritizing his safety. Walking away from a situation where he's uncomfortable is a valid decision. The problem arises if one person pressures the other to not use protection, which could lead to health risks. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wrong here might be the girl's behavior\u2014forcing the use of her condom without compromise. However, the author's action of not using hers and leaving could be seen as standing up for his boundaries. But since they're in a new relationship, communication is key. The author might have been wrong to not discuss her reasons for preferring her own condom instead of just refusing to use his. \n\nAlternatively, if the girl is pressuring him to use her condom without understanding his concerns, that's an issue. However, the author's decision to walk out might be justified if he felt uncomfortable. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries and safety.\n"
