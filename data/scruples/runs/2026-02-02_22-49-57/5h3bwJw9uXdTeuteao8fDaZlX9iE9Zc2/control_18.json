Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when they were going to have sex. The situation is that the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to leave if he didn't. The author ultimately left, but now he's second-guessing his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of consent and mutual agreement in sexual encounters. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure for both parties. The key here is communication and respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is insistent on using her own condom, maybe there's a reason\u2014like she prefers a certain type or has a specific method of using it. However, the author had already prepared his own, which shows he was responsible and ready. \n\nWhat's important is that both partners should agree on the terms of their sexual activity. If the girlfriend is pressuring the author to use her condom and he feels uncomfortable or pressured, he has the right to refuse. On the other hand, if the girlfriend felt that her preference was being disregarded, that could be a valid concern for her. The situation seems to hinge on mutual respect and understanding. \n\nThe author's initial action was to bring his own condom, which is responsible. When the girlfriend insists on hers, he refuses and leaves. That could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries. However, maybe there's a lack of communication here. The girlfriend might have had a reason for preferring her own, such as personal preference or health reasons, but the author didn't comply. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties should discuss and agree beforehand. If the author felt pressured to leave, maybe he could have talked it out more. However, if the girlfriend was being insistent and controlling, the author's choice to leave could be justified. The fact that the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon but then insisted on her own condom adds another layer. Maybe she was preparing for future pregnancy and wanted to ensure she was using a specific method, but the author might not have known that.\n\nIn conclusion, if both parties are not in agreement, it's a red flag. The author's decision to leave might have been about respecting his own boundaries, but the girlfriend's insistence might indicate an issue with communication. So, depending on the perspective, the author might not be in the wrong if he respected his own limits, but the situation highlights the need for better communication between both partners.\n"
