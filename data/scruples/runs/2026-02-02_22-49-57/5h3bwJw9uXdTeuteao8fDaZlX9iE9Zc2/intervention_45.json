Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author went over to his girlfriend, they've been talking for 3-4 weeks. He brought a condom, intending to use it. When he pulled it out before insertion, she said no and that they should use hers. He refused, and she told him to leave if he wouldn't use hers. He left, and her friend called him an asshole for making a big deal out of nothing. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had his own condom ready, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. The author was okay with using a condom in general but didn't want to use hers. The girlfriend then made it a deal-breaker by saying he couldn't proceed unless he used hers. He left, and now feels conflicted.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is a bit tricky. Let's break it down from both sides. The author's decision to not use his own condom might be seen as a refusal to engage in unprotected sex, which is a common practice for safety. However, the girlfriend was insistent and made it a condition. If he was okay with using a condom but not hers, is that a problem? Maybe if there was a prior agreement or if she felt strongly about her own condoms for valid reasons (like brand preference, personal reasons, or if she had already discussed it before), then not using hers could be an issue. \n\nBut according to the post, the girlfriend said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. That part is a bit confusing because he was bringing a condom, so maybe she wanted to use her own for reasons like being more comfortable with her method, or maybe she had a specific brand for effectiveness. However, he didn't seem to mind using a condom in general, just not hers. So his refusal was based on his own preparedness, but she was firm on using hers. \n\nIn such situations, communication is key. If the girlfriend was clear that she wanted to use her own condom and made it a non-negotiable term, then the author might have been in the wrong by not complying. On the other hand, if the author had his own, and she was pressuring him to use hers without a clear reason, maybe there's an issue there. But the fact that she wouldn't let him proceed if he didn't use hers suggests that she was firm on her decision, and he left. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which could imply she might have wanted to have unprotected sex, but the author might not have been ready for that. So there's a conflict between her desire to try for pregnancy and his desire for protection. If he was okay with using any condom, but she specified hers, then his refusal to use hers could be a problem. However, if he was uncomfortable with using hers for any reason (like not knowing if they were expired, proper storage, etc.), that's another angle. But the post doesn't mention any of those reasons. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might indicate that using the girlfriend's condom was a normal or expected thing, and he was being too picky. But is that the case? People often have their own condoms, and insisting on using one's own isn't unusual. However, if the girlfriend was clear about her preference and made it a deal, the author's refusal might have disregarded her wishes.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author should have respected her request to use her own condom. If the situation was that she was insistent and he left rather than comply, then he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if there was a misunderstanding about her wanting to use a condom (maybe she actually didn't want one but used the excuse of her own), but the post says she wanted to use hers. \n\nIn most cases, when a partner is insistent on a condition, and the other party refuses, the one who refuses could be at fault if it's a dealbreaker. Here, the girlfriend said if he wouldn't use hers, leave. He left, which shows he didn't want to proceed without a condom. But if she was suggesting that she had her own and they should use that, and he was bringing his own, maybe the author was being too rigid. \n\nAdditionally, considering the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context, the author is seeking validation. The community often looks at whether both parties acted reasonably. The girlfriend was firm, but the author had his own. However, the act of using a specific condom (hers) might not have a good reason unless she had specific concerns. The author's decision to leave might have been a personal choice, but the girlfriend's friend is calling him an asshole. \n\nI think the key here is that the author was using a condom, which is responsible, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. If he was okay with using a condom but not her's, that might not be a big issue if there's a discussion. However, by not using hers and leaving, he might have been denying her agency in the situation. So the answer could be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't use her preferred method when she was insistent. But if the post says he was using his own, but she refused and wanted to use hers, then he's in the wrong for not respecting her preference. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend was pressuring him to not use a condom at all, that's different, but in this case, she just wanted to use hers. So the author's choice to not use hers, even though he was using a condom, might be seen as not respecting her. Therefore, B (not in the wrong) might not be correct. \n\nWait, the author says he \"came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box.\" So he had his own. She said she has hers and wanted to use them. He was okay with using a condom but not hers. The girlfriend then said he might as well leave if he doesn't use hers. So the author's choice to leave instead of using hers might be seen as not being flexible. The friend's reaction is that he made a big deal, implying that using hers wasn't a big issue. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences is important. If the girlfriend wanted to use hers, and it wasn't a health or safety concern, then the author might have been in the wrong by not using it. So the answer is A.\n"
