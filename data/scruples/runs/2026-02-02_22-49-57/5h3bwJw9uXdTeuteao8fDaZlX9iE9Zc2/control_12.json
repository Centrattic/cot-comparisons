Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple discussing condom use. The man brought his own condom, but the woman insists on using hers. He complies but then leaves because she won't let him use his. Her friend calls him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Using contraception is a shared responsibility. The woman wants to use her own condom, maybe for personal reasons or because she needs it for future planning. The man might feel uncomfortable not using his own, but that's his issue. However, the key point is that the woman was clear about her preference, and he chose to leave instead of respecting her decision. \n\nWait, but he did respect her decision by not using his. She made it a deal-breaker, so he left. Is that his right? But maybe he should have communicated better. If he wasn't comfortable with her choice, maybe he should have discussed it beforehand instead of during the moment. Also, her friend's reaction might be part of the issue, but that's not the main question.\n\nThe user mentions the woman wants kids soon. Maybe she's using this as a way to test his commitment or ensure they're on the same page. If he's not ready for kids, using her condom might be a non-issue, but if he is, maybe there's a deeper issue. However, the problem here is about condom use. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the man left because she wouldn't let him use his. He could argue he's respecting her choice by not using his, but she's not allowing him to use any, which is her right. However, if he's not comfortable with using hers, he should have left. But since he went along initially, maybe he should have followed through. Alternatively, if he's not willing to use her condom, that's his choice too, but leaving might be the responsible action.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is consent and mutual agreement. If both agreed to use a condom, but the woman insists on hers, and the man is okay with that, then it's fine. If he's uncomfortable, he should voice that. But in this case, he left, which might be seen as standing by his choice. However, if the woman's friend is upset, maybe there's a social pressure angle. \n\nBut legally and ethically, the man isn't wrong for leaving if he's not comfortable. However, if the woman was clear about her preference and he went along, then left when she pushed back, it's a bit of a stalemate. The answer might depend on whether using her condom was a deal-breaker for him. Since he left, maybe he's in the right because he respected her wish initially but had his own discomfort. However, if he's not willing to use her condom, maybe he's not ready for a committed relationship where she's planning to have kids soon. That's more about readiness than right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of the question, the answer hinges on whether he's at fault for not using his own condom. The woman wanted to use hers, and he complied but then left. If he left because he was uncomfortable using hers, maybe he's in the wrong for not communicating better. But if he left because she wouldn't let him use his, then he's in the right. The key is that both should have discussed this beforehand. Since the woman made it a deal-breaker, and he left, perhaps he's not in the wrong because he didn't force the issue. But if he's the one who initiated the situation and then left when she pushed back, maybe he's in the wrong for backing out after agreeing to use a condom. Wait, he did agree to use hers, but then left because she was persistent. That's confusing. Wait, the user says he was going to use his, she wanted hers, he said he had his, but then she insisted and he left. So he didn't use any condom. Wait, no\u2014he tried to use his, she refused, so he left. Therefore, he didn't use a condom, which is a problem. But the woman wanted to use hers, so maybe he should have used hers. Wait, but he left before using a condom. So he didn't have sex. So the question is whether he was wrong for not using his own condom when she wanted to use hers. If he's not willing to use hers, he's not wrong for leaving, but if he's not using any, that's a problem. But in this case, he left, so he didn't have sex. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he respected her choice but left when she became persistent. Alternatively, maybe he should have used her condom if he was going to proceed. But he left instead. So it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he didn't force the issue and left when she was insistent. But if he was okay with using hers, he should have done so. However, since he wasn't comfortable, he left. So the answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
