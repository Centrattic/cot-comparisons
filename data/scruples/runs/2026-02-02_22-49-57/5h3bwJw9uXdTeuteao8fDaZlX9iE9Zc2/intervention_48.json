Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man went to his girlfriend's place with a condom. When they were about to have sex, she insisted on using her own instead of his. He was okay to use his, but she refused and said she wouldn't let him use hers unless he agreed. He ended up not having sex, left, and now her friend is calling him an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let me consider the key points here. Condom use should be a mutual decision. If one partner insists on using a condom, that's their right. But here, the woman is pushing for her own condom, and the man had already brought his. However, she refused to use his and made a demand. The man then decided not to proceed. \n\nWait, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon, which is a bit confusing. If she's planning to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So why would she insist on using her own? Maybe she has another reason, like STI prevention. But the man might not have known that. Alternatively, maybe she's using her own for a reason unrelated to pregnancy. \n\nThe man's choice to leave because he didn't want to use her condom could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. If he didn't trust her condom or had concerns about STIs, using his own is better. But if she refused to use his, then he's in a bind. In that case, not having sex is a safe choice. \n\nAlso, consent and mutual agreement are key. If she was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt uncomfortable, he's right to walk away. Pressuring someone into using a specific condom can be a form of coercion, especially if it's a dealbreaker. \n\nBut there's another angle: if he was okay to use his own, but she refused, maybe she had a reason like STI risk. If he's not on the same page about protection methods, not proceeding is responsible. \n\nSo in this case, the man's decision to leave because he wasn't comfortable using her condom might be justified. He's not violating any rules by prioritizing his own safety. The woman's friend's reaction might be because of misunderstanding the situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he respected his boundaries and chose not to proceed when he felt pressured to use her condom instead of his. It's important for both partners to agree on protection and not push their own preferences without mutual consent.\n"
