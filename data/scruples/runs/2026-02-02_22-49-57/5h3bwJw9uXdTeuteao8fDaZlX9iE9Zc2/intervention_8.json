Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. The situation is that the author brought a condom, but the girlfriend refused to use it, saying she had her own and wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. The author got scared, left, and now the girlfriend's friend is upset, making the author doubt their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which is important. If she wants to become pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe her insistence on using her own condom is a red flag. But why would she do that? Maybe she's not actually trying to conceive and is using that as an excuse. Alternatively, she might have her own reasons for not wanting to use the author's condom, like maybe she's not on birth control or wants to take control over her reproductive decisions.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. If the author felt uncomfortable with her insistence, then walking away could be a responsible choice. However, the author had already prepared a condom, which shows they were considering protection. The girlfriend's reaction to the author's condom, including threatening to end the encounter if he used his own, is concerning. That kind of pressure could be a form of coercion, especially if she's using her desire for a relationship to make him comply.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been overreacting. If the girlfriend had legitimate reasons for using her own condom, like preferring a specific type or having her own supplies, maybe it's reasonable. But given the context about wanting kids soon, it's possible she was being deceptive. The fact that she's making a big deal about the condom when she's trying to get pregnant is contradictory and might indicate dishonesty.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is protective of himself. He had the right to use the condom he brought, and her refusal could be a sign of not respecting his boundaries. However, if the author is in a serious relationship and the girlfriend is genuinely trying to conceive, using a condom would contradict that. So maybe the girlfriend's behavior is more problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should discuss and agree on birth control methods. The author's actions were about protecting himself, which is valid. The girlfriend's insistence without clear communication might be the issue here. The friend calling the author an asshole complicates things, but the main question is about the author's actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He made a choice to prioritize his comfort and safety, which is important. However, the situation highlights the need for open communication between partners about health and reproductive goals. The girlfriend's behavior might be the real problem here, especially if she's trying to manipulate the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
