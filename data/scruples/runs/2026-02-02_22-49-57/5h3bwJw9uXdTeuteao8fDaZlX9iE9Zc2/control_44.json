Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went over to his girlfriend's place and brought his own condom. When they were about to have sex, the girlfriend insisted on using her own condoms instead. The author had thought about kids in the future but didn't think much of it initially. He refused to use hers and left. Now he's second-guessing his decision, and her friend called him an asshole. The question is whether he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and condom use. Both parties should agree on the terms of sexual activity, including contraceptive methods. The author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. The key issue here might be who has control over the situation and whether the girlfriend's refusal is a form of pressuring or controlling the author's choice.\n\nIn terms of rights, when it comes to sexual activity, both partners have the right to express their preferences. However, if one partner insists on a certain method and the other refuses, it's important to consider safety and consent. But in this case, the author had his own condom, and the girlfriend was objecting to using his. The author chose to leave when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. \n\nNow, in terms of responsibility, using a condom is a shared responsibility for STI and pregnancy prevention. The fact that the author had a condom and the girlfriend wanted to use hers might not be a problem if they were both in agreement. However, the girlfriend's insistence to use hers and her ultimatum (leave or use hers) might be seen as pressuring the author. \n\nBut another angle is that the author is prioritizing his own preparedness. He had his own condom, so why would he need to switch? Maybe there's an issue of trust here. If the author is concerned about STIs, using his own condom is valid. However, the girlfriend might not want to use his for reasons unrelated to health\u2014maybe she prefers her own brand, or there's some other personal reason. But if she's not in a position to accept his choice and insists on hers, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control and relies on condoms. So using a condom is important regardless. The author's refusal might not be the issue in terms of pregnancy prevention if they both agree on using a condom. However, the conflict here is about who provides the condom. \n\nIn terms of consent, if one partner is pressuring the other to use their condom, that could be a red flag. But if both are okay with using a condom and the author is just bringing his own, then the issue is more about control. The author left, which shows he respects the situation when she made it clear she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. However, if he had agreed to use hers from the start, maybe the situation wouldn't have arisen.\n\nBut the problem here is that the author had his own and was prepared, but the girlfriend was not. The author might feel that he's responsible for bringing the condom, which is a common practice. The girlfriend's insistence could be seen as trying to control the situation. However, if the author is comfortable using hers, it's a different story. But he wasn't, so he left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both partners should communicate their needs and preferences. The author had the right to use his own condom, and the girlfriend had the right to express her preference. However, when she made it an ultimatum, the author's choice to leave might be seen as standing his ground. But if the girlfriend's insistence was based on something like safety (e.g., she doesn't trust his condom for some reason), then the author's refusal could be problematic. \n\nBut in this case, the author had a fresh condom from the box, so there's no issue with his. The girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe in their social circle, using the woman's condom is the norm. But from a general standpoint, bringing your own condom is standard and responsible. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He had his own, was prepared, and left when pressured to use hers. However, the girlfriend's behavior in making it an ultimatum could be the issue. The author's choice to prioritize his own preparedness and leave might be seen as right because he's not compromising his own comfort or safety. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
