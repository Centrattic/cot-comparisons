Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy went to his girlfriend's place intending to have sex. He brought his own condom. When they were about to have sex, the girl insists on using her own instead. He tried to use his, but she wouldn't allow it and even said she wouldn't have sex with him unless he used hers. He didn't agree and left. Now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let's break down the possible angles.\n\n1. **Consent and Communication:** The girl mentioned wanting to have kids soon. That might mean she's not using contraception, or maybe she's not on the pill. If the guy is not ready for a child, using a condom would be necessary. But she's saying she has her own, maybe implying she's on birth control? Or maybe she's trying to transition to not using condoms because she wants to get pregnant. There's some miscommunication here. Did he know her intentions clearly? The girl's persistence could be about her own birth control method, but the guy might not be on board with that. However, the guy brought his own condom, so he's prepared to use one. The girl's refusal to use his might be about control or something else.\n\n2. **Condom Use and Health:** Using a condom is a personal choice each person has the right to make. However, if one person insists on using a condom and the other refuses, that could be a problem. In this case, the guy wanted to use a condom (his own), but the girl refused. She's pushing for using hers, but the guy might not know if her condoms are safe or if she's been tested. But the guy is the one who's prepared; he knows his condom is new and safe. If the girl is pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's not comfortable with using his, perhaps due to past issues or a lack of trust. However, the guy's choice to leave because he wasn't comfortable with her insisting on hers could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries.\n\n3. **Control and Pressure:** The girl is being very firm, even to the point of saying she won't have sex unless he uses hers. That's a lot of pressure. The guy's response was to leave, which is a reasonable boundary. However, if the girl was trying to use her own method (like the pill) and the guy is okay with that, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The guy might not have considered that she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom. But he brought his own, so maybe he didn't know she was on the pill. The friend calling him an asshole complicates it, suggesting maybe the girl or her friend think he's being unreasonable.\n\n4. **Readiness for Children:** The girl wants kids soon, but the guy might not be ready. If they're not on the same page about having children, that's a big issue. However, if she's trying to transition to not using condoms because she wants to conceive, but he's not ready, that's a conflict. The guy's insistence on using a condom might be about preventing pregnancy, but if she's on the pill, maybe she's confident enough. However, relying solely on the pill isn't 100% effective, so using a condom adds another layer of protection. If the guy is uncomfortable with the risk, he has the right to use a condom, even if she's on birth control.\n\n5. **Respect and Mutual Agreement:** In any sexual relationship, both parties need to agree on contraception. If there's a disagreement, it's important to discuss and find a solution both are comfortable with. The guy leaving might be an overreaction if the girl was trying to communicate her needs but the guy didn't listen. Alternatively, if he's standing by his need for a condom and she's being unreasonable, he's in the right to set that boundary.\n\nPutting it all together: The guy wanted to use a condom, which is a standard practice for protection. The girl's insistence on using hers might be about her own methods (like birth control) or control. The key issue is whether they discussed their needs and expectations beforehand. If the guy was aware she wanted to get pregnant soon and didn't use a condom, that's a problem. But since he brought his own and was prepared, maybe he didn't know. The girl's pressure to use hers without clear communication might be the issue. However, the guy leaving because he wasn't comfortable with her choice could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. On the other hand, if the girl was on birth control and he's not considering that, he might be being overly cautious without understanding her method.\n\nGiven the info, the guy isn't in the wrong if he's following his own boundaries and prepared to use protection. The girl might be in the wrong for pressuring him without clear communication. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
