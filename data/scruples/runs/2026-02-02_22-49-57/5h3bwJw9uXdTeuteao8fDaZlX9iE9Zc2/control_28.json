Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. The situation is that they met after a few weeks of dating, and the man brought his own condom. The woman refused to use his and demanded to use hers, even threatening to end the encounter if he didn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The key issue here is about respecting each other's preferences and boundaries. The woman wanted to use her own condom, which could be for various reasons\u2014maybe she prefers a specific brand, has her own supplies, or there's an unspoken agreement. The man's initial action was to use his own, which the woman didn't want. When she became firm and even made it a deal-breaker, he left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the woman is insistent and sets a boundary, then respecting that boundary is important. However, if the man felt uncomfortable with using her condom for any reason (like not knowing where it was stored, safety concerns, etc.), he should have communicated that. But in this case, the man didn't refuse; he just left when she said no. \n\nThe woman's friend calling him an asshole might be part of the story, but the main point is the negotiation between the two people involved. If the woman was okay with using her own condom, then the man's choice to leave rather than comply might be seen as not respecting her decision. However, if the man had a reason not to use her condom (maybe he was concerned about her not using a new one, or other safety issues), that's different. But the story doesn't mention any such concerns. \n\nSo, the man brought his own, she wanted hers. She refused to proceed unless he used hers. He left. If she had stated her preference beforehand, he should have been prepared. But in this situation, he didn't respect her boundary when she became firm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring her request. Alternatively, if the request was sudden and he had no opportunity to prepare, maybe not. But since he had 3-4 weeks to talk about such things, maybe he should have been more prepared. \n\nAlso, when she said she wouldn't proceed without using hers, he left instead of negotiating. If he was okay with using hers, but she was making it a deal-breaker, he should have either agreed or said he wasn't comfortable. Leaving without resolving it might be seen as capitulating to her demand but in a way that caused conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should communicate their needs. If the woman wanted to use hers, she should have communicated that earlier. The man should have been ready to respect her choice. If he was uncomfortable with using hers, he should have expressed that before arriving. But in this case, he didn't. So, the man's actions of bringing his own and then not using hers when she was firm might be the issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
