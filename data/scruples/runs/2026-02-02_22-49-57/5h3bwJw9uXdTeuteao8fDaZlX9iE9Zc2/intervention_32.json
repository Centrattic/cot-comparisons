Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers and even made him leave when he didn't comply. Now he's questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy had his own condom ready, which shows he was prepared. The girl said she had some and wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, but she was persistent and eventually made him leave. The main issue here is about consent and mutual agreement regarding contraceptive use.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are comfortable with the method of protection. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's choice, that's a valid concern. But in this case, the guy was willing to use a condom, which is a standard way to prevent pregnancy and STIs. The girl's insistence might be about her own preference, maybe she wanted to use a specific brand, or perhaps there's another reason related to her health or plans.\n\nThe user's friend called him an asshole, but that might just be her friend's opinion. The key question is whether the guy was wrong to use his own condom. Since he was using protection, which is responsible, and the girl was the one setting the condition, maybe the problem is on her side. However, if there's a mutual agreement to use protection, both should be okay with it. If she was insistent and made him leave, maybe she's overstepping, especially if it's about her own health.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy could have considered her feelings more. Maybe she had a reason to prefer her own condom, like a specific type or because she's been using them for a while. But he had already prepared his, so he might not be at fault for proceeding with that. The main point is mutual consent and communication. If she was uncomfortable with his condom, she should have communicated that earlier. But he was trying to use protection, so he might not be wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he was using a condom, which is responsible, and she's the one who set the condition. However, there's a nuance here because both should communicate better. But since he was using protection, and she didn't want to proceed without hers, the issue might be more on her side. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
