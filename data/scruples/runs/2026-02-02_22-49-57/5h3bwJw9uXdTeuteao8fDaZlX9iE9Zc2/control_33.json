Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went to his girlfriend's place with a condom he brought, but she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his own, but she refused and made him leave. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy brought his own condom, which is responsible. The girl wanted to use hers, maybe because she mentioned wanting kids soon. But she's being insistent, even to the point of making him leave. He leaves, and her friend calls him an asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and autonomy in sexual health. Using a condom is a personal choice, and both partners should have a say. However, the girl is forcing him to use her condom, which could have different reasons. Maybe she's concerned about the guy's STI status, or maybe she's testing his compliance. But refusing to use a condom he provided could be a safety issue if she's not on birth control or has other reasons.\n\nThe guy's perspective is that he's being forced to use her condom, which he might not trust, or maybe he's uncomfortable with that. On the other hand, if the girl is insistent and even makes him leave, maybe she's trying to take control of the situation for her own reasons. But forcing someone to use a specific condom could be seen as pressuring the other person, which isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then refused to use her own condom is confusing. If she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's not using birth control, so using a condom is important. But if she's already on birth control, maybe she thinks it's not necessary. However, STI prevention is still important. \n\nThe guy left, which might be the right choice because he wasn't comfortable using her condom. But the problem is that the girl is being controlling, and her friend is being judgmental. The guy is now doubting himself, thinking he should have gone along with her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is mutual consent and communication. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom without discussing reasons, that's not healthy. The guy asserting his choice to use his own is valid. However, if there's a medical reason she needs to use hers, that's different. But without that info, he's within his rights to refuse. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
