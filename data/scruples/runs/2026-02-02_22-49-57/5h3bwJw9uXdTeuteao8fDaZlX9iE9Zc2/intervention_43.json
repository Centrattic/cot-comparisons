Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the author bringing a condom, but the girlfriend insisting on using hers and even refusing to proceed unless he uses hers. The author then decides not to use hers and leaves, and now he's getting texts from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author had a condom, was ready to use it, but the girlfriend refused and insisted on hers. He mentions she had mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply that maybe she was trying to get pregnant, hence not using a condom. But he was okay with using his, so he thought she was being persistent in her refusal. He felt scared and left. Now he's second-guessing.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nI should consider consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should have a say in the method of protection. The author was willing to use a condom, but the girlfriend wanted hers. However, if she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she's not using a condom at all. But the author was okay with using one, so she might be trying to prevent pregnancy. Wait, no\u2014if she wants to get pregnant soon, she wouldn't use a condom. So maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex to conceive faster. The author was okay with using his condom, but she wanted hers. Wait, but why would she want to use hers if she's trying to get pregnant? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The author thought she wanted to use her own for some reason, but actually, maybe she didn't want to use any condom. Hmm.\n\nSo the author had a condom, but she wanted to use hers. However, if she's trying to conceive, maybe she didn't want to use any condom. Maybe she was trying to get him to use none. The author was okay with using a condom, so he might have misread her intent. Alternatively, perhaps she had her own reasons for bringing her own, but he wasn't willing to comply. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important that both partners agree on the method of protection. If the author was okay with using a condom but the girlfriend insisted on not using one, then the author might be in the right to refuse. But in this case, she wanted to use hers. Wait, but if she's trying to get pregnant, she wouldn't want a condom at all. Maybe there's a misconception here. The author might have thought she wanted to use a condom, but she actually wanted unprotected sex. So by insisting on using his own, he might have been preventing her from getting pregnant. But the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. Maybe she was trying to avoid pregnancy until they were more serious. This is confusing.\n\nAnother angle: the author had the right to use his own condom. If the girlfriend is pressuring him to not use it, maybe she's violating his boundaries. But if the condom was a mutual decision, then he should respect her wishes. However, the author was the one who brought a condom and was ready to use it, but she refused. So perhaps she was trying to have unprotected sex, and he was trying to protect himself. But if she's against using a condom, maybe he's in the right to refuse. But the problem is that the girlfriend is pressuring him to use hers instead of his own. However, if the author was okay with using a condom, and the girlfriend wanted to have unprotected sex, then he's in the right to stick with his own method. The confusion comes from whether she actually wanted to use a condom (hers) or not. If she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex. In that case, the author is in the right for not using a condom, but she was trying to get him to use hers. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If she wanted to have unprotected sex, she would not want any condom. So maybe she was trying to get him to use hers, but actually wanted to use none. But that's not possible. Maybe she had her own reasons for using hers, like preference or brand.\n\nThe key here is mutual consent and communication. The author was prepared to use his own, but the girlfriend insisted on hers. If the author is uncomfortable using hers (maybe he's not sure about the safety), he has the right to refuse. However, if the author was okay with using a condom but she wanted to use hers, and he's against that, then it's a matter of negotiation. But in this case, the author didn't want to use hers and left. Is that in the wrong? It depends on the circumstances. If she was pressuring him into not using any condom, then he's right. But if she was just wanting to use her own, perhaps he's being stubborn. However, since the girlfriend is trying to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using a condom at all. If so, by bringing his own, he's trying to prevent pregnancy, which might be against her wishes. In that case, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes to have unprotected sex. But since she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she wants to conceive. Therefore, if he's using a condom, he's preventing that. The girlfriend might be trying to get him to not use one. However, he's trying to use one, so maybe she's confused. \n\nThis is a bit of a tangled situation. The main issue is whether both parties agreed on the method of protection. The author had his own, but the girlfriend didn't want to use it. If she's trying to conceive, then using a condom would be against that, so she might have wanted to have unprotected sex. However, the author was trying to use a condom, so he's protecting against pregnancy. If she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she's trying to get him to not use one. However, the author is uncomfortable with using hers. So the conflict arises when she's insisting on hers and he's not willing to. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong if he's choosing to use a condom and she's trying to prevent that. However, if the argument is about using hers instead of his, maybe it's more about personal preference. But since she's trying to conceive, using a condom would be counterproductive. Therefore, if the author is using a condom, he's going against her wishes to have unprotected sex. In that case, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her wishes. But he might not know that she wants to conceive and is trying to have unprotected sex. The confusion here is whether she wants to use a condom or not. If she wants to have unprotected sex, then using a condom is against her wishes. But if she's pressuring him to use a condom (hers), then maybe there's a misunderstanding. \n\nGiven the information, the author brought a condom, was ready to use it, but the girlfriend refused and wanted to use hers. If the author is okay with using a condom, but the girlfriend wants to have unprotected sex, then he's in the right to use his own. However, if she's trying to have unprotected sex and he's using a condom against her wishes, then he might be in the wrong. But the scenario is a bit ambiguous. The user argues the author is not in the wrong, and I need to decide between A and B. Considering that the author was prepared to use a condom, but the girlfriend refused and wanted to use hers (which could be a way to have unprotected sex), the author might be in the right for standing his ground. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was trying to have unprotected sex, then the author is in the right to use a condom to prevent pregnancy. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
