Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement over which condom to use between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers and even threatened to leave if he didn't. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might relate to her not wanting to use a condom. The author thought maybe they'd just mess around. But when she got insistent, he refused and left. Now, her friend is calling him an asshole, and he's unsure if he should have gone along.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy. The author was prepared and wanted to use a condom, which shows he's responsible. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is pressuring him not to use his and insists on using hers. Maybe she has her own reasons, like wanting to get pregnant, but that's her choice. However, if she's not on birth control or if there's a risk of STIs, then using a condom is the safer option.\n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both parties should be comfortable. The girlfriend's refusal to let him use his condom and the ultimatum to leave might be an overreaction. The author standing his ground could be seen as asserting his boundaries, especially since he had valid reasons for using his own condom. However, the situation could have been handled with more communication. Maybe discussing birth control methods or STI testing beforehand would have avoided this conflict.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend calling the author an asshole might be because she didn't anticipate the refusal. But if the author was firm in his belief to use a condom, and the girlfriend was insistent on not using his, it's a matter of conflicting priorities. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing protection, especially if he's not ready for parenthood or has health concerns. The girlfriend's stance might be about her own desires, but she should respect his boundaries as well.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He made a responsible decision to use a condom, and when the girlfriend wouldn't compromise, he chose not to proceed. The problem might lie more with the girlfriend's pressure and lack of communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
