Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that he brought his own, but she insisted on using hers and even said he should leave if he didn't. He ended up leaving, and now he's getting messages from her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual activities. Both partners should feel comfortable and agree on the terms. The girl wanted to use her own condom, maybe because of her plans to have kids soon, which could relate to her desire to control the situation. But the guy was prepared with his own. \n\nWait, but why would she need her own if he already provided one? Maybe she had specific reasons, like maybe she prefers a certain type or there's an issue with his condom? Or perhaps she was trying to exert control. However, if she's insistent and he's okay with it, that's one thing. But he felt scared and left. \n\nThe key points here: mutual consent is essential. If he was okay with using hers, then maybe it's fine. But he wasn't comfortable, so he left. But she said to leave if he didn't, so maybe he's in the right to prioritize his safety. However, if she's in a position of control and he's backing down, maybe there's an imbalance. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might imply she's not trying to prevent pregnancy, but maybe she still uses condoms for other reasons (like STIs). If he's not on birth control or something, using a condom is important. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether he was wrong to not use hers. If he's uncomfortable with using her condom, then he's right to not proceed. Sexual activity shouldn't be forced. However, if he was okay with it but just preferred his own, then not using hers could be seen as not respecting her choice. But in this case, he didn't want to use hers, so he left. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might be biased. The girl might have felt pressured, but the guy was also asserting his preference. The problem is whether he was wrong to not comply. If mutual agreement wasn't reached, then neither should proceed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for STI prevention, both should be on the same page. If he was okay with using hers, then maybe it's okay, but if he's not, he's not wrong to say no. However, if she's insisting and he's okay, then maybe he's being too rigid. \n\nBut in this scenario, he left because she was being persistent and even threatening to make him leave. So maybe he's in the right to not let her pressure him. Alternatively, maybe he should have discussed it more calmly instead of leaving. \n\nI think the key is whether he was in the wrong for not using hers. Since he had his own and she was insistent, but he felt uncomfortable, leaving might be the right choice. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
