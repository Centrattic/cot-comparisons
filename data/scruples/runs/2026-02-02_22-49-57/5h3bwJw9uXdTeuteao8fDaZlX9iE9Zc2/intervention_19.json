Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The original post is an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario where the person (the author) didn't use their girlfriend's condom and instead tried to use their own. The girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to leave if he didn't. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a condom from their own supply. The girlfriend didn't want to use it and insisted on hers. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she wants to conceive, so using her own condoms could be about ensuring they're the right type or maybe to achieve pregnancy. The author felt scared and left when she became persistent, and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nNow, considering consent and autonomy. Using a condom is a mutual decision. The girlfriend's insistence might be about her own preferences, possibly related to her reproductive goals. If she wants to get pregnant, not using a condom would make sense. But the author was prepared with his own and was trying to use it. However, the girlfriend is the one who set the terms of using hers. If the author refused to comply, maybe because he didn't trust her condoms or had safety concerns, that's a different angle. But in this case, the author didn't mention any safety issues with her condoms. He just wanted to use his own.\n\nThe concept of consent includes the right to set boundaries. The girlfriend is asserting her boundary by not allowing his condom. If the author is okay with using her condom, that's one thing. But if he's not comfortable, he shouldn't proceed. However, in this case, the author is using his own condom, but she's not allowing it. So there's a conflict here. The author's choice to leave when she insists on hers might be seen as respecting her boundary. Alternatively, if she's the one who wants to have sex without a condom (to get pregnant), then using her own might be her way of ensuring that. The author's refusal could be a violation of her wishes, leading to the conflict.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual agreement. If the author was prepared with a condom and the girlfriend changed her mind, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, the girlfriend's persistence and the ultimatum (\"if I wasn't to use hers, I might as well leave\") suggests that she was clear in her boundaries. The author, in this case, is in a position where if he doesn't agree to her terms, he should not proceed. So walking away might be the responsible choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate social pressure or misunderstanding. The author's hesitation and second thoughts could be due to feeling rejected or confused about the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not in the wrong if he respects her boundaries. However, if the girlfriend wanted to have unprotected sex to conceive, and the author is okay with that, but she insists on using her own condom for some other reason (maybe to prevent pregnancy but wants to get pregnant in two months, which is conflicting), there's a misunderstanding. But the key is mutual consent. If the author is uncomfortable with her insistence, he is within his rights to leave. However, if the reason she wants to use her own condom is to avoid pregnancy, and the author is okay with trying to conceive, then using her condom might be a way to control that. But if the author is not ready to get pregnant, there's a problem. However, the original statement says the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's open to trying, which would mean using no condom. The confusion here is why she's insisting on her own condom if she wants to get pregnant. Maybe it's about brand preference or specific type, but the author is using his own.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions: he had a condom, she wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, she refused. He left. If the author is not okay with not using a condom, then walking away is the right move. However, if the girlfriend is the one who wants to have unprotected sex to conceive, then the author's refusal to comply with her wishes might be an issue. But the author's responsibility is to protect himself and respect mutual agreements. Since the situation is unclear about the actual intent behind her wanting to use her own condom, the author's decision to leave could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. However, if the girlfriend is the one who set the condition that they must use her condom, and the author refuses, he's not respecting her terms, which could be seen as a problem.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author is not in the wrong if he's following his own comfort level and safety. But if the girlfriend's insistence is part of their agreed-upon terms for the encounter, then walking away might be justified. The key is mutual consent and communication. Since the author didn't mention any prior discussion about using her condoms, it's possible that she changed her mind or had a hidden agenda. In such cases, the author's choice to leave is a responsible action to avoid a situation where he's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
