Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who insists on using her own condom instead of the one the author brought, and she even threatens to end the encounter if he doesn't comply. The author then leaves but later feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a condom ready, but the girlfriend refused to use it and insisted on hers. She mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might imply she's on birth control or has other methods. However, the author was uncomfortable not using his own and left. Now, her friend is upset, calling him an asshole.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. If the girlfriend is on birth control, maybe she's not worried about pregnancy, but STI protection is still a concern. If she's not on any protection, then using a condom is crucial. The girlfriend's insistence on her own condom could be about control, preference, or maybe she's not using protection otherwise.\n\nThe author's decision to leave when she refused to use his condom might be seen as standing up for his boundaries, especially if he's not on birth control or has STI concerns. However, if the girlfriend is using another form of contraception, maybe she's confident in her method, but the author might still have valid reasons to prefer his own condom.\n\nBut here's the catch: if the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom and he refuses, is that a red flag? Maybe she's trying to exert control or has hidden reasons. But in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't wrong for wanting to use a condom. However, walking away might have been the right choice if he felt uncomfortable. The girlfriend's reaction and her friend's judgment could indicate a toxic dynamic where the woman is trying to dictate terms without considering his comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is the one who brought the condom and the girlfriend is refusing, maybe she's not using protection otherwise. In that case, the author's refusal to proceed without a condom is responsible. But in this case, the author is the one who had a condom ready, so the fact that he left might show he respects his own boundaries. However, the girlfriend's insistence might also be a sign of control, and the author's decision to leave could be justified if he felt pressured.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own safety and comfort. The girlfriend's behavior might be problematic, but the author isn't wrong for walking away. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
