Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went to his girlfriend's place, intending to have sex and brought his own condom. She said no and insisted on using hers, mentioning she has some. But he didn't take her seriously, maybe thinking they would just not go through with it and mess around instead. Then she got persistent, told him to use hers or leave, and he left. Now her friend is calling him an asshole, and he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. When it comes to sexual activity, both partners need to agree on the terms, including contraceptive use. He brought his own condom, which is responsible, but she was clear about not using his and wanted to use hers. If she said \"no\" and insisted on her own, then he should have respected that. But why would she do that? Maybe she has a reason like STI prevention, or maybe she's not comfortable with his condom, or maybe it's a personal preference. But if he didn't take her refusal seriously and proceeded regardless, that's a problem. However, he actually stopped when she said he had to use hers. He left, so he didn't go through with it. \n\nBut he thought they would just \"mess around\" for a week or two and that's it. Maybe he didn't realize the importance of her insistence on using her own. However, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or is in a position where she could get pregnant. So if he was using his own condom, maybe she wanted to make sure he used hers for some reason\u2014like maybe she's been on a specific method, or perhaps there was an unspoken agreement. \n\nWait, the key point here is that he didn't use her condom and left instead. The problem is that she was insistent, and he didn't comply. Even if he had his own, if she's not comfortable with his, then he should use hers. If he had his own and she didn't want to use it, then he should respect her preference. But he didn't. He tried to use his own despite her saying no. So that's a violation of her wishes. Therefore, he's in the wrong. \n\nBut he left. So maybe he wasn't being insistent. However, the act of bringing his own condom and trying to use it when she said no shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. Even if he was prepared, if she's not comfortable with his, then he shouldn't use them. Also, she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on the pill or another method, and using her own condom would be part of a different plan (like maybe she's using a different contraceptive, but wants to use her own for preference or because of her STI risk). \n\nHe might have thought she was just toying with him, but if she's clear and says \"no\" and insists on her own, then he should comply. The fact that he left might make it so he didn't actually go through with the act, but his initial action of not respecting her stated preference is still the issue. So the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
