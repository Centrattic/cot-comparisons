Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using their girlfriend's condom. So, the situation is that they went to her place, brought their own condom, but she wanted to use hers. He tried to use his, but she insisted on hers and said if he didn't, he should leave. He left, and now her friend is calling him an asshole. He's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Both parties should have the right to express their preferences regarding contraception. Using a condom is a personal choice, and ideally, both partners should agree on which one to use. However, the fact that the woman is trying to pressure him into using hers and threatening not to proceed if he doesn't might be a red flag. Also, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which complicates things because maybe she's not on birth control, so using a condom is a necessary precaution for her. But he might be uncomfortable with her condom for various reasons\u2014maybe it's expired, or he doesn't trust it, or he prefers his own. \n\nHe did bring his own, which shows he took responsibility. But when she insisted on hers, he felt scared and left. That shows he wasn't comfortable overriding her choice. However, the friend's reaction is harsh, calling him an asshole. The user is wondering if he was in the wrong for not complying.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent pregnancy and STIs. If he's not on the same page about using hers, especially if he's unsure about her reasons or the condom's condition, he has a right to be cautious. On the other hand, if she's insistent and he's willing to use hers, that's another matter. But the fact that she was so adamant that he had to leave if he didn't use hers might indicate a lack of mutual respect. \n\nAlso, considering her future plans about wanting kids soon, maybe his refusal to use hers could be seen as a lack of trust or consideration for her needs. But if he's not comfortable, that's his right. The key here is that both should have communicated better. He did bring his own, which is responsible, but she's pressuring him to use hers. If he's not on board, he's within his rights to leave. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether his refusal was justified. If he had a valid reason not to use hers (like expiration, distrust, etc.), then he's not in the wrong. But if he simply preferred his own and she was reasonable, maybe he could have compromised. However, since she was threatening to stop the encounter, his choice to leave might be the right decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
