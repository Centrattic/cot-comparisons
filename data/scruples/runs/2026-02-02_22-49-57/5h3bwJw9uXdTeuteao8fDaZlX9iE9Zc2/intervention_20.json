Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the author brought his own, but the girl insisted on using hers. He mentions that she had mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be a red flag. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author came prepared with a condom, which is responsible. The girl refused to use his and insisted on hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author then left, and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nNow, from a safety perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the author is concerned about that, using his own makes sense. But the girl's insistence on using hers could mean she has her own reasons, maybe she doesn't trust his or maybe she's trying to conceive. However, the girl's behavior here is a bit concerning. Insisting on using her own condom when the author is okay with using his own could be seen as controlling or manipulative. \n\nThe author's decision to leave when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers seems reasonable. Walking away from a situation where you're pressured to compromise your boundaries is a good move. Also, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then refused to use her own condom in a way that might affect pregnancy is a bit conflicting. If she wanted to conceive, maybe she wouldn't need a condom. But if she's not ready for that yet, maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy, so using hers would be about control.\n\nThe friend's reaction that the author is an asshole might be because they see the girl's demand as reasonable, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. It's important to respect personal boundaries. The author's main issue is that he felt pressured to use her condom, which he wasn't comfortable with. Since he left instead of complying, he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. If the girl had her own condoms, maybe she wanted to have control over the situation, but the author's own preparation shows he's responsible. The problem arises when one partner insists on using their own method without considering the other's. Consent and mutual agreement are key here. Since they couldn't reach an agreement and the author chose to leave, that's a responsible action. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries and prioritized his safety. The girl's behavior was controlling and possibly manipulative, so the author made the right call by walking away.\n"
