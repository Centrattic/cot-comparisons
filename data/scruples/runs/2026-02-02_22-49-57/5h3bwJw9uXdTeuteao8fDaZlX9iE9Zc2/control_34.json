Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He ended up not having sex because she wouldn't let him use his own. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not go along.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should have a say in how they want to proceed. The girl mentioned wanting to use her own condom, which might be about her personal preference or maybe health reasons. However, the guy had already brought his own, so maybe he preferred his. But the key here is that the girl was firm about using hers and even made him leave when he tried to use his. \n\nNow, the girlfriend said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. The author left but then her friend called him an asshole. The author is now doubting if he should have agreed to use hers. \n\nFrom a safety standpoint, using a condom is important for both partners. The fact that the girl had her own suggests she was also planning to use one. The conflict here is about who brings the condom, not about using one. So, the author isn't wrong for bringing his own, and the girl isn't wrong for preferring hers. But the author left when she wouldn't accept his. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe the author should have discussed this beforehand instead of assuming she wanted to use hers. Also, when she insisted, he had the right to not proceed if he wasn't comfortable. But maybe he could have agreed to use hers to avoid the situation. \n\nBut wait, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's on birth control, but using a condom is still a shared responsibility. However, if she's using her own, it's her choice. But the author had his own, which is also his right. \n\nIn terms of STI protection, using a condom is important. The fact that he had his own shows he was taking precautions. She might have her own reasons for using hers, which he should respect. However, the author is now thinking he might have been too rigid. \n\nSo, the question is whether refusing to use her condom when she insisted is wrong. Since both want protection, it's a mutual decision. If she's insistent, he could have agreed to use hers to proceed, but he also has the right to not have sex if he's uncomfortable. However, leaving might have been his way of respecting her boundaries. \n\nBut the friend's reaction complicates things. Her friend called him an asshole, which might mean they think the author was wrong to not comply. But maybe that's just the friend's opinion. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom because he had his own and was prepared. However, he could have handled the situation more by discussing it beforehand. But since he left when she wouldn't accept his, he's not necessarily at fault. So, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
