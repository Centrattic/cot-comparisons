Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. So the situation is that they were about to have sex, he brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers and even said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He didn't want to and left instead. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and sexual health. Using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then insisted on using her own condom is a bit confusing. Maybe she's on birth control? If she's not, then using a condom is necessary for pregnancy prevention. But if she's on birth control, maybe she's more concerned about STIs. Alternatively, maybe she's not on birth control and this is a way to prevent pregnancy while still having unprotected sex? \n\nThe author had his own condom ready, which is good. But she refused to let him use it. Now, why would she do that? There could be different reasons. Maybe she prefers her own for comfort, maybe she's uncomfortable using someone else's, or maybe there's an underlying issue. However, pressing the issue to the point of threatening to leave if he doesn't comply with her choice might be a problem. Consent is mutual, so if she's making it a condition that he uses her condom, and he refuses, he's not in the wrong for exiting the situation, right?\n\nBut then again, if she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's trying to control the situation. However, insisting on safe sex is important. Wait, if she's insistent about using a condom, regardless of whose it is, that's a positive. But if she's only allowing her own, maybe there's an issue with trust or something else. \n\nThe user says he \"thought nothing of it originally\" when she mentioned wanting kids soon. So maybe he thought she wanted to have unprotected sex, but now she's pushing for a condom. That's confusing. But he's not in the wrong for wanting to use his own. If she's forcing him to use hers, maybe she's trying to take control of the situation, but if he's uncomfortable with that, he has the right to refuse. \n\nAnother angle: using someone else's condom. Is there a risk there? If it's a new, unopened condom from her, maybe not. But if there's any reason he doesn't trust her, that's a problem. But the article doesn't mention any issues with her condom. So maybe it's about personal preference. \n\nAlso, the fact that her friend called him an asshole adds complexity. Maybe her friend is biased or thinks he's overreacting. But the main issue is between him and his girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties need to agree on the terms of the encounter. If he's not comfortable using her condom for any reason, he can refuse. But if she's insistent to the point of being coercive, maybe that's a red flag. However, she's not coercing him into sex without a condom; she's just specifying which condom to use. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author made a choice that prioritized his comfort with using his own condom. Since both condoms are safe, the issue is more about control or preference. If she was insistent in a way that was non-negotiable and made him feel pressured, maybe she's overstepping. On the other hand, if he's not willing to compromise, that's also a point. \n\nBut in the end, he left the situation when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That shows he respected his boundaries. So perhaps he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
