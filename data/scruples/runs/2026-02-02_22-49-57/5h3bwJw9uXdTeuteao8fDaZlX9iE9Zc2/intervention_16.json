Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The story is about a situation where he brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, and he left because she was persistent and even threatened to make him leave otherwise. Then, her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but the user thought they'd just \"mess around for a week or two.\" Wait, the timeline here is a bit confusing. The user said they've been talking for 3-4 weeks, and the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids in two months. But on the day in question, they were planning to have sex, and he had a condom ready. She didn't want to use his and insisted on hers, but he left because he wasn't comfortable with that. \n\nHmm. So, the key points are: 1. He had a condom ready. 2. She wanted to use her own. 3. She made it a deal-breaker, saying he should leave if he didn't. 4. The user left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and communication. Using a condom is a personal choice. If the girlfriend was okay with having unprotected sex, but the user isn't, then using his own condom is his right. But if she's the one who initiated the situation and then changed her mind, but in a way that he felt pressured to comply with her preference (using her condom), but he stood his ground because he wanted to use his own. Wait, no, the story says he brought his own, and she didn't want him to use it. So maybe she wants to use her own for some reason, like maybe she prefers a different type, or there's an issue of control, or perhaps she wants to have a child earlier than he's ready for.\n\nWait, the user thought that maybe they would \"mess around for a week or two\" and that would be it. But the girlfriend had said she wants kids soon, in two months. So maybe he was under the impression that they weren't moving towards serious things yet, but she was. If she's insistent on using her own condom, maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex but didn't say it. But why would she push for her own condom? Or perhaps she wanted to use a specific type of condom, or she had her own for safety reasons. \n\nThe user's main reasoning is that he didn't want to leave, but he felt pressured and scared. He left because she said he should. The friend's reaction is that he's an asshole for not using hers. But the question is about whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual consent. If the user is uncomfortable with using her condom, maybe there's a reason. But generally, if both parties agree to use a condom, the user of which is up to them. But if the girlfriend is trying to pressure him into not using a condom (by saying he can't have sex unless he uses hers), that's a red flag. Wait, but the user left when she said he couldn't proceed unless he used hers. So, he chose not to have sex rather than comply with her request. If she wanted to have sex without a condom, but he wanted to use one, he's standing up for his boundaries. That would make him right. However, if she was okay with using a condom but wanted to use her own, and he insisted on using his, then maybe it's a different scenario. \n\nBut the key part here is the girlfriend's statement that if he didn't use hers, he might as well leave. That sounds like coercion. The user left because he wasn't comfortable with the situation. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to agree on contraception methods. If one partner is pressuring the other to not use a condom, that's a problem. The user is choosing to not engage in an activity that he's uncomfortable with, which is his right. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for leaving. He had a right to use his own condom, and if she was pressuring him to not do that, he's within his rights to set a boundary. The answer would be B, No.\n"
