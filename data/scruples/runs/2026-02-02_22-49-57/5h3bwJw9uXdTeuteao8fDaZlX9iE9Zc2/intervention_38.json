Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The guy brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers. He was okay with using a condom in general, but she wouldn't let him use his. She even threatened to make him leave if he didn't use hers. Now, he's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, consent is a big part of this. He was prepared with his own, but she wanted to use hers. If both parties are okay with using a condom, maybe the brand isn't the issue. But the girl was insistent to the point of making him leave if he didn't use hers. That sounds controlling or maybe she had a reason for her own condoms.\n\nWait, she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she didn't want to use a condom and was trying to push him to use hers (maybe they're not for protection but for something else? Like, maybe she's on birth control and wants to have sex without a condom to get pregnant, but she's pushing her own condoms which aren't for protection? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe she's using her own condoms for some other reason, like maybe they're not safe? Or maybe she just prefers her brand.)\n\nBut the key point here is mutual consent. If she's pressuring him to use her condom instead of his, but he's not comfortable with that, he has the right to say no. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. If she's making it a deal-breaker, that's a red flag. However, if he was willing to use a condom but just had his own, maybe he should have gone along with hers to avoid conflict. But he felt scared and left. Now her friend is calling him an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the guy's actions: he brought his own, she wouldn't let him use it. He left. Is he wrong? If he was okay with using a condom but just preferred his own, then not using hers isn't wrong. But if the issue is that she wanted to avoid using any condom (maybe to get pregnant), then he's protecting himself. However, he didn't mention that she was against using a condom entirely\u2014she just wanted hers. Maybe he should have used hers if he was okay with using a condom. But he was scared, so that might be his own hesitation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if both are okay with using a condom, the brand shouldn't matter. So maybe he's not wrong for bringing his own, but if she's pressuring him to use hers and he's not, maybe he's wrong? Or maybe she's wrong for being controlling. It's a bit of a gray area. But from a safety standpoint, using a condom is good. If he was okay with that, using hers might be fine. But if he's uncomfortable with her condom for a reason, like maybe it's expired or not safe, then not using it is right. However, the post doesn't mention any issues with her condoms. \n\nSo, the guy's reasoning is that he was scared. Maybe he overreacted. But he's now doubting himself. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom. If the main goal is mutual protection, then using any condom is better than none. So maybe he should have gone along with hers. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not compromising. But if he had valid reasons (like her condoms are not safe), but the post doesn't say that. So, based on the info given, he's not in the wrong because he was prepared with his own and she was being controlling. Or is he wrong for not using hers when he was okay with using one? Hmm.\n\nI think the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because if both agree to use a condom, it's better to use the available one rather than escalate the situation. But if she was being unreasonable, maybe not. It's a tough call. But since he left and now feels conflicted, maybe he's in the wrong for not giving in. Alternatively, he's not wrong because he was respecting her preference, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no\u2014he was prepared with his own, but she wanted hers. If he had used hers, that would have been respecting her preference. Since he didn't, maybe he's in the wrong. But the situation is more complex. The girl was being controlling and pressuring him, which is her issue, not his. So he's not wrong for not giving in. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
