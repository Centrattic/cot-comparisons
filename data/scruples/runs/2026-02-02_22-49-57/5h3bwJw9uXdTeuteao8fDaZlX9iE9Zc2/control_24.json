Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brings his own condom, but the girl insists on using hers. He refuses and leaves, and now he's getting criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. Condom use is a shared responsibility in sexual health. The guy came prepared with his own, which is responsible. The girl wanted to use hers. She even said she won't proceed unless her condom is used. The guy insists on using his own and leaves. Then her friend calls him an asshole.\n\nNow, from a health perspective, both should have their own condoms. But in this case, the girl was insistent on her own. The guy had the right to refuse, but maybe there's an issue with not respecting her boundaries. Wait, but the girl's boundary was to use her condom. If he's not okay with that, maybe the issue is mutual. But the guy left, which shows he wasn't okay with her condition. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Using your own condom is generally okay. However, if the partner is not comfortable with that, maybe there's a communication breakdown. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control, but if she's using condoms, maybe she's okay with that. The guy's choice to leave because he didn't want to use her condom\u2014could that be seen as dismissing her health choices? \n\nWait, but using your own condom is a personal choice. There's no obligation to use the partner's. However, if the partner is insistent that their condom be used, maybe there's an underlying reason. But the guy had his own, so he's taking responsibility for his own health. The problem is that they didn't compromise. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should agree on the method. If she's not allowing him to use his own and he's not willing to use hers, then neither is compromising. But the guy left, which could be seen as him not wanting to proceed under those conditions. \n\nHowever, the fact that she's pressuring him to use her condom and he refuses\u2014maybe he's in the right because he's asserting his own boundaries. Or is he in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries? It's a bit of a gray area. But generally, each person has the right to use their own condom. \n\nThe key here is that both should have their own. However, if the partner insists on using theirs, maybe the guy's refusal is his way of ensuring his own safety. But if she's not comfortable with his condom, that's a problem. \n\nBut in this case, the girl's insistence on using her own condom might be about her control over the situation. The guy's refusal could be about his control. So it's a conflict of boundaries. Neither is necessarily wrong, but both need to communicate better. However, the guy left, which could be a way of asserting his choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he did come prepared. She had hers. The issue is who uses which. The guy's choice to leave because he didn't want to use hers might be his right. But maybe he could have used her condom instead. \n\nBut the problem is that using the other person's condom could pose health risks if it's not his own. So he's right to stick with his own. But if she's refusing to proceed unless he uses hers, that's a power play. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy isn't in the wrong for not using her condom because he has the right to use his own. She's in charge of her own health, and he's in charge of his. The problem is the lack of mutual agreement. However, the guy's choice to leave shows he's standing by his boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
