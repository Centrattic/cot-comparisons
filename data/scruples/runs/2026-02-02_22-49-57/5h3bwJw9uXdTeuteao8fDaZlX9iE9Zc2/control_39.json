Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that he brought his own, but she insisted on using hers. He left because she wouldn't let him use his.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. The woman was clear she wanted to use her own condom, which is her right. The author had the right to decline, but maybe the way he handled it was an issue. When she said she wouldn't proceed if he didn't use hers, he walked out. That could be seen as not respecting her boundaries if he was pressuring her to use his instead.\n\nBut wait, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex. However, she still insisted on using her condom, which is confusing. Maybe she wanted to protect against STIs but not pregnancy? Or maybe she was trying to conceive, so using her own condom could be a way to track timing or something else.\n\nThe author had the choice to either comply with her request or not proceed. Walking out might not be wrong if he felt uncomfortable, but if the situation involved her not wanting to use a condom at all, that's different. However, since she did want a condom, just her own, maybe the issue is about mutual respect. Insisting on using his own when she specified hers could be a power play. Also, her friend's reaction might be part of the context, but the author shouldn't let others influence his decision here.\n\nCondoms are a personal choice. If she's okay with using a condom, even if she wants kids, maybe she's being cautious. The author's refusal to use hers could be seen as not respecting her decision. However, bringing his own and being prepared is good, but the conflict arose when she wanted to use hers. Maybe the issue is about whose condom to use, which isn't a big deal unless it's a matter of STI risk. If both are in a monogamous relationship, maybe it's not about that. \n\nIn terms of consent, if she's willing to use a condom, then using hers shouldn't be a problem. The author left because she wouldn't let him use his. But if she's adamant about using hers, then he either complies or leaves. Neither is necessarily wrong, but forcing the issue could be. However, if the author is uncomfortable with using her condom for any reason, he has the right to leave. But if she's comfortable with using a condom, and he's just being stubborn about whose to use, that's his issue.\n\nThe key points are mutual consent and respect for each other's boundaries. If she set a boundary that they use her condom, and he walked out because of that, then he's not respecting her boundary. If he's not willing to compromise and it's causing a conflict, that's on him. But if she was pressuring him to not use a condom at all, that's different. The situation is a bit ambiguous, but given that she wanted to use a condom (just hers), the author leaving might be his choice, but he could have respected her by using hers. However, using his own is also his right unless she's allergic or there's a specific reason to use hers. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the right if he's uncomfortable with using her condom, but if the problem is that she wanted to use hers and he refused, then he's not respecting her wishes. But the text says she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she wants to get pregnant, so using a condom might not be her intention. Wait, that's conflicting. If she wants to have kids soon but insists on using a condom, maybe there's another reason. Maybe she's using a specific type of condom or there's another factor. The author thought she wanted to use hers to track fertility, but maybe that's not the case. \n\nIn any case, the main issue is consent. If she's okay with using a condom, then the author's refusal to use hers is not respecting her choice. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't comply with her boundary, leading to conflict. Her friend's judgment is irrelevant; the focus is on their mutual agreement. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
