Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy went over to his girlfriend's place intending to have sex. He brought his own condom, which is a responsible move. When he tried to use his, she insisted on using hers instead. He mentions that she said there's no need because she has some, but he insists on using his. She then becomes persistent, saying they must use hers and even threatening to make him leave if he doesn't comply. He backs out, and her friend later calls him an asshole. Now he's second-guessing his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and autonomy. The guy prepared by bringing his own condom, which is a standard practice. When she insists on using hers, he complied with his own preference, which is also okay because using a condom is a mutual decision. However, when she refused to proceed unless they used hers, that's where the tension arises. \n\nWait, but the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon. If that's the case, maybe she's not on birth control and relies on condoms. But if she's okay with using her own, then why the conflict? Maybe the guy is uncomfortable with using her condom because of hygiene or trust issues? Or maybe he feels that bringing his own is his responsibility. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the method of protection. Forcing the use of a specific condom, even if it's their own, could be seen as a form of pressure. But if she's adamant and refuses to proceed unless he uses hers, that's a power dynamic where her needs are prioritized over his comfort. \n\nBut here's the catch: both condoms are equally effective. If she's okay with using her own, and he's okay with using her's, there's no problem. However, if he's uncomfortable, he should have the right to express that. However, if she's refusing to have sex unless he uses her condom, that's a form of coercion. \n\nWait, the guy says he backed out because she was insistent. The question is whether he was wrong to not use her condom. The issue here is mutual respect. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe there's an underlying issue. Alternatively, if he's being stubborn and not respecting her preference, that's also a problem. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe the social pressure is on her side. But from a personal ethics standpoint, both should have a say in the matter. The guy's choice to use his own condom isn't inherently wrong. However, if the woman is insistent and he's okay with using hers, then using hers would be respectful. But if he's uncomfortable, he shouldn't be forced. \n\nThe key here is consent and negotiation. The guy shouldn't be pressured into using a specific condom if he's not comfortable. On the other hand, if the woman's preference is clear and he's willing to accommodate, then using hers is fine. The conflict arises when one party refuses to budge. \n\nIn this case, the guy chose not to use her condom and left. The question is whether that makes him wrong. If he's respecting his own boundaries and the woman is not allowing negotiation, then he's in the right to leave. However, if the woman's insistence is about safety or her medical needs (like wanting to use her own for STI protection), then the guy has a responsibility to comply. \n\nBut the guy mentions she wants kids soon. If they're planning on having children, maybe using a condom isn't necessary if they're both on the same page. But if he's uncomfortable, again, it's about mutual agreement. However, the story says they were going to \"do the deed,\" implying they weren't ready to conceive yet. So maybe the condom is necessary. \n\nWait, the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but thought they'd \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it.\" Maybe there's confusion here. If she wants kids soon, but they weren't ready, using a condom is important. If he's using his own, that's okay, but she wants to use hers. Maybe she's testing his reliability or something. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main issue is whether the guy was wrong to not use her condom. If he's respecting his own preference and she's respecting his, it's fine. But if she's forcing him to use hers, that's a problem. However, in this case, the woman is the one who got angry and had her friend call him an asshole. The guy left when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he uses hers. \n\nSo, from a standard perspective, both should have the right to their preferences. If the guy is okay with using her condom, he should. If not, he can. But in this scenario, the woman is pressuring him, and he's leaving. Is that wrong? It depends on the context. If he's not comfortable, he's not wrong to leave. However, maybe the woman had a valid reason (STI concerns, etc.), but the story doesn't mention that. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy isn't in the wrong because he's respecting his boundaries. The woman's insistence to use her condom without negotiation could be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
