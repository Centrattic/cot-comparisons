Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He thought she was okay with using his, but she said no and threatened to leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and now he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and control over one's body. The author had his own condom ready, but the girlfriend refused to use it. She stated that she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That seems like a power dynamic where she's asserting control. The author chose not to proceed, which is a reasonable decision to avoid conflict or pressure.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that the author could have been more open to compromise. He might have not considered that she had a valid reason for wanting to use her own condom, like knowing her STI status or preferring a specific type. But the way she phrased it\u2014saying he has to use hers or leave\u2014could be seen as coercive. He felt scared and left, which shows he wasn't comfortable with her insistence.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply that she's not on birth control or has other reasons. If the author is concerned about pregnancy or STIs, using a condom is a mutual decision. But she might have been in a position where she felt she could control the situation, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole adds another layer, suggesting that maybe the girlfriend's side is framing the situation as the author being unreasonable. But the author's actions were to leave when he felt uncomfortable, which is a healthy response. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong because he stood up for his own boundaries. The girlfriend's insistence without understanding his perspective might be the issue here. It's a mutual problem where communication was lacking, but the author's choice to walk away was the right thing to do.\n"
