Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. The situation is that they had been talking for a few weeks, and when it came time to use a condom, the girl wanted to use her own instead of his. The guy had his own, but she refused and even got a friend involved to call him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. If one partner insists on using their own, there should be a discussion about why. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not using contraception otherwise, but maybe there's another reason she wants to use her own. However, the guy had his own, and she refused to let him use it. \n\nThen there's the aspect of trust and communication. Both partners should agree on the type and use of contraception. If she's insistent on using hers, maybe she has a reason, but if he's uncomfortable with that, he should express why. However, in this case, he used his own and she wouldn't let him. The problem here is that she made it a deal-breaker, saying he should leave if he didn't use hers. \n\nThe guy left, but later felt unsure if he was wrong. The key points are mutual consent and safety. If she's trying to push her own condom, maybe there's an issue with his (expired?), but he didn't mention that. If she's against using his for some reason, that's her choice, but forcing him not to use his own might be overstepping. \n\nAlso, her friend calling him an asshole adds pressure. The guy's decision to leave might have been about respecting her boundaries, but if he had concerns about the effectiveness or trust in her condoms, he should have discussed it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should be on the same page. If she's the one who brought up wanting kids, maybe she's the one who should be on birth control, and using her condom would be part of that. But if he's not comfortable with her method, he should have communicated that. \n\nSo, the guy had his own, which he brought for a reason. She refused to let him use it, which could be disrespectful. The guy left, which might have been a good move if he felt pressured. However, if she had valid reasons (like her condom is better or she's on birth control and wants to avoid another), maybe he should have listened. \n\nBut in general, each person has the right to use their own contraception. If she's making it a condition to use hers, that's her choice, but if he's not comfortable, he's within his rights to leave. So maybe the guy isn't wrong for walking out if he felt it was a safety issue. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then refused his condom might indicate she's not as prepared as she thought, which could be a red flag. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a mutual issue. The guy had a right to use his own, but she had a right to insist on hers. The problem is the lack of communication. If they couldn't agree, it's better to not proceed. So the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving.\n"
