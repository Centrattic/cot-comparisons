Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers instead. The situation is about consent and safety in a sexual encounter. \n\nFirst, the author brought his own condom, which is responsible. The girlfriend didn't want to use his and insisted on hers. He refused and left. The key points here are: \n\n1. **Consent and mutual agreement**: Both parties should agree on the use of protection. If one person is uncomfortable with the other's method, they should discuss it beforehand. The girlfriend's insistence might be about her preferences, but she also mentioned wanting kids soon, which complicates things. Maybe she wanted to use her own condoms for tracking or something else. \n\n2. **Safety concerns**: Using a condom is a mutual decision. If the author was uncomfortable with her condom for any reason (like not knowing if it's expired, proper storage, or just personal preference), he has the right to not proceed. But in this case, she's providing the condom, so it's her choice. However, if he's the one who brought his own and she's pushing for hers, maybe he has a reason to be cautious. Wait, the author says he was scared. Why? Maybe he thought she was pressuring him into something, but if she's insistent on using her own, perhaps he should have communicated his concerns.\n\n3. **Communication issues**: The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon but they were only dating for a few weeks. That might be a red flag. She might have had her own plans, but the author wasn't on board. Also, her friend texting him to call him an asshole and making a big deal suggests she's handling it poorly. But the author left when she refused to use his condom. Is that reasonable? If he's not comfortable with her condom, he has the right to not proceed. But if the issue is just about who's condom is used, maybe it's a bigger issue about control or trust.\n\n4. **Legal and ethical aspects**: In many places, it's illegal to use a condom that someone else provides without knowing its status. So if he's using her condom, he's taking a risk if he doesn't know if it's safe. But in this case, she's providing it, so maybe that's not the issue. The author's choice to leave because she wouldn't let him use his own might be about his own comfort level. However, the girlfriend's refusal to use his could be a problem if she's trying to exert control over the situation.\n\n5. **Respect and boundaries**: Both parties should respect each other's boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with her condom for any reason, he's in the right to not proceed. But if she's insistent and he leaves, maybe the issue is about communication. The girlfriend's response (friend calling him an asshole) indicates she's upset, but the author's action (leaving) was a form of standing his ground.\n\nPutting it all together: The author brought his own condom, which is responsible. The girlfriend wanted to use hers, possibly for her own reasons. If he's uncomfortable with her choice, he's within his rights to not proceed. However, leaving immediately might have been a reaction to feeling pressured. The girlfriend's insistence could indicate she's not respecting his preparedness. However, if the issue is about her wanting to use her own method (maybe she tracks cycles or has other reasons), he might need to communicate better. But in the situation described, the author chose not to comply, which he has the right to do. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
