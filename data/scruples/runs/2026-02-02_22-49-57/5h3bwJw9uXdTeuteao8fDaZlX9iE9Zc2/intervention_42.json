Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not using their girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. The situation involves a condom preference and a disagreement about whose to use.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The guy brought his own condom, but the girl refused and insisted on using hers. He mentioned she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be relevant if they were trying to conceive. But in the scenario, they weren't actually trying to get pregnant at that moment; she just mentioned wanting kids soon. So maybe she's not on birth control, or they're planning for the future, but not necessarily right now. \n\nThe key issue here is the condom choice. Condoms are a personal safety measure, and there's a general understanding that either partner can have preferences. However, there's also the aspect of consent and mutual agreement. If the girl refused to proceed unless he used hers, and he refused to use hers, leading to him leaving, is that a problem?\n\nIn terms of sexual health, using a condom is a shared responsibility. Both partners should ideally agree on the method of protection. However, if one partner is insistent on using their own, it's a matter of negotiation. The guy brought his own, which is proactive. The girl's refusal might stem from her own reasons\u2014maybe she has specific condoms she prefers, or maybe there's another underlying issue. \n\nBut then there's the part where she says she won't have sex unless he uses hers. That's a form of pressure. If he's uncomfortable with that pressure, he's within his rights to walk away. Consent should be mutual and not based on ultimatums. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, and he's not willing, then his decision to leave is his choice. However, the text from her friend calling him an asshole complicates things. It might indicate that her friend, and maybe she, view his refusal as disrespectful.\n\nAnother angle: in situations where there's a disagreement about contraception, both partners should discuss and agree beforehand. The guy's action of bringing his own shows he's prepared, but maybe he should have discussed condom use before the situation escalated. However, in the heat of the moment, he might not have considered her preference. \n\nIf the girl is trying to conceive, maybe she's not using any contraception, so using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But if she's not on birth control and they aren't ready to conceive, using a condom is necessary. However, in this case, the user said they thought she wanted kids in two months but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. That part is a bit confusing. If they were not trying to conceive at the time, using a condom would be appropriate. If she's not on birth control, using her condom might be part of their plan, but maybe the guy isn't on board with that yet.\n\nEthically, the line between asserting one's preference and being inconsiderate is thin. The guy's refusal might be seen as not respecting her wishes, especially if she clearly stated she won't proceed unless he uses hers. However, he might have valid reasons for preferring his own, like brand preference or hygiene. The pressure she exerted by threatening to make him leave could be considered coercive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy's choice to leave might be justified if he felt uncomfortable with the pressure. However, refusing to use her condom when she insists could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. There's also the aspect of mutual consent and communication. They might need to have a more open conversation about their expectations and safety measures rather than making it a last-minute ultimatum.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the girl's insistence was a form of coercion or if the guy's refusal was his right. Since the guy brought his own condom, which he had prepared, and she refused, leading to a stalemate, both parties have some responsibility to communicate better. However, in this specific instance, if the girl's refusal to proceed unless he uses hers is a form of ultimatum, the guy's choice to leave could be his way of asserting his own boundaries. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
