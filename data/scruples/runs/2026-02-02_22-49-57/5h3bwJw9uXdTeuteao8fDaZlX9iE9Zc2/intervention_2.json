Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a condom. The author went to his girlfriend's place with a condom he brought. When the time came, the girlfriend insists on using her own, and when he tries to use his, she gets persistent and even makes him leave. Then a friend texts him calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual activities. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, but the author had his own. The key point here is whether both parties agreed on the use of a condom before the situation escalated. \n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend said she has some, but he already had one. She then insists on using hers and refuses to proceed unless he uses hers. The author refuses and leaves. The girlfriend's friend is upset with him. \n\nNow, the author is wondering if he did the right thing. From a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancies. But in this case, the girlfriend mentions wanting to have kids soon, which suggests she might not be using contraception otherwise. However, the author might be concerned about using her condom if there's any risk involved or if he's not comfortable with it. \n\nBut here's the thing: in consensual sex, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If one partner insists on a specific method and the other refuses, it could be a matter of respecting each other's boundaries. The girlfriend is pushing for her own condom, and the author is pushing back. \n\nWait, the author says he came prepared with his own. The girlfriend might have her own reasons for preferring her condoms\u2014maybe she trusts her own or has a specific type. But if the author is not comfortable with using her condom, he has the right to refuse. However, if the girlfriend is insistent and it's causing conflict, maybe he should have discussed it beforehand. \n\nBut the situation escalated quickly. The girlfriend is making it a deal-breaker, which might not be healthy. If the author is uncomfortable with using her condom, he's in his right to leave. However, maybe he should have had a conversation earlier about their preferences regarding protection, especially considering her mention of wanting kids soon. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's friend is calling him an asshole. That might indicate some social pressure or maybe the girlfriend's side is overreacting. But from the author's perspective, he followed through with his own condom. The girlfriend's insistence could be seen as controlling or not respecting his preparedness. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should have discussed their preferences before getting to that point. The author leaving might be an exercise of his personal boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with not using a condom but he is not, then he's right to leave. But if she's not on board with that, then the conflict arises. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on mutual consent and communication. If the author is uncomfortable with her condom for any reason (like not trusting it, not being the right type, or not having discussed it before), then he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend is insistent and the author is leaving due to discomfort, maybe the issue is about respecting each other's needs. \n\nIn some contexts, if one partner insists on using a condom and the other refuses, that's a problem. But here, the author is using a condom, just his own. The girlfriend is against that and wants to use hers. If he's okay with using a condom but just prefers his own, there's no issue. However, if the conflict is about whether to use any condom at all, then the author is right to use one. \n\nBut in the scenario, the girlfriend is not against using a condom; she just wants to use hers. The author is not willing to use hers. If the problem is about which brand/condom to use, then it's a minor issue. However, if the girlfriend is pressuring him and he's standing his ground, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the main point is mutual agreement. If the author is not comfortable with using her condom, he has the right to refuse. However, if the girlfriend is not comfortable with his, then that's her issue. If the author is prepared and wants to use his own, and the girlfriend is not allowing it, then maybe the author is not in the wrong for leaving. \n\nSo the answer is B (No).\n"
