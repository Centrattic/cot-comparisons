Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who went over to his girlfriend, they had been talking for a few weeks. He brought a condom from his own supply. When they were about to have sex, he pulled out the condom, but the girlfriend said no and wanted to use hers. She was insistent and even said she wouldn't have sex unless he used hers. He refused, left, and now he's getting texts from her friend calling him an asshole. He's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. He had a condom ready, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. She was very persistent, to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author left, thinking maybe he shouldn't have done that. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might relate to her preference for her own condom, perhaps because of brand, type, or maybe even STI concerns. Wait, but if they're both in a relationship, maybe they trust each other. However, using one's own condom is a common practice for safety.\n\nIn terms of consent and safety, both parties should have a say in the method of protection. If the girlfriend is okay with using his condom, that's fine. But she wanted to use hers. The author didn't want to use hers, so he left. Now, the question is, was he in the wrong?\n\nFrom a health perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the girlfriend is insistent on using her own, maybe she has a reason. However, if the author is uncomfortable using her condom, he has the right to refuse. The problem is that she was so insistent that she made it a deal-breaker. \n\nBut wait, the author brought his own, so he was prepared. The girlfriend's insistence might be about control or her preference. The author's choice to leave is his right, but maybe he should have discussed it more instead of just leaving. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum (\"you might as well leave\") is a form of pressure. If someone is pressuring you to use a specific method and you're not comfortable, it's okay to walk away. \n\nBut the girlfriend's friend is calling him an asshole. That suggests maybe the girlfriend's side is seen as more reasonable here. But the author's reasoning might be that he was prepared with his own condom, so why switch? Also, using one's own condom can be a personal choice for safety, especially if there's any doubt about the other person's stash. \n\nAnother angle: if the girlfriend is planning to get pregnant soon, using a condom at all might be about birth control. But if they are trying to conceive, maybe she doesn't want to use one. However, the author mentions she thought they would mess around for a week or two, so maybe she still wants to avoid pregnancy. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nIn terms of consent, both parties need to agree on the terms. If the girlfriend is insistent and the author refuses, it's a stalemate. The author left, which is his right. The girlfriend's friend's reaction might be based on her perspective that the author was being stubborn. But the author might feel he was respecting his own boundaries by using his own condom.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the girlfriend was insistent and the author left, which could be seen as not respecting her wishes. On the other hand, he had brought his own and was prepared, and leaving when uncomfortable is his right. However, in some contexts, using the other person's condom isn't a big issue if they're in a trusting relationship. If the author is worried about STIs, using his own makes sense. But if they trust each other, maybe the type of condom isn't an issue.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's refusal to use her condom was a legitimate boundary or if it was being obstinate. If the author had concerns about the condom's quality or if there was a specific reason not to use hers (like it's expired or not preferred), that's different. But the story doesn't mention that. He just says he had his own, so he was prepared.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to use his own condom and leaving when she was insistent. However, the situation could have been handled better with communication. He might have asked why she preferred hers before refusing. But given that he was prepared and left without being confrontational, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
