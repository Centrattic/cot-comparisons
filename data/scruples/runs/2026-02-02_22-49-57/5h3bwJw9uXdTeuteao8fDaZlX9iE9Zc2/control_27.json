Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to use her condom because maybe she mentioned wanting kids soon, but he didn't act on that. Instead, he tried to use his own, she refused, and he left. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not go along with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. When it comes to sexual activity, both parties should agree on the terms, including the use of protection. The girl said she wouldn't proceed unless he used her condom. The guy had his own, but she was adamant. If he didn't want to use her condom, maybe he shouldn't have proceeded. But there's also the aspect of respecting her choice.\n\nWait, but he brought his own condom. Maybe she had reasons for wanting to use hers, like trust issues\u2014maybe she didn't want him carrying his own, or perhaps there's a medical reason. Alternatively, maybe she trusted her own supplies more. However, the guy didn't back down when she said she wouldn't go through with it unless he used hers. He ended up leaving, but she got mad at him.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and respect. If she was clear that she wouldn't proceed without using her condom, and he didn't comply, then maybe he was wrong to not agree. However, if he felt uncomfortable using her condom for any reason (like not trusting her supply, or if there was another issue), he might have been right to leave.\n\nBut in terms of standard practice, when someone is insistent on their own protection method, the other person should respect that. If he wasn't willing to use her condom, then maybe he shouldn't have pushed it. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might mean she's not on birth control, so using a condom is important. If he didn't use a condom and she wanted one, that's a problem. But in this case, he had a condom, she wanted hers, and he tried to use his. She said no and refused to proceed. He left, but then she got angry. \n\nWait, the guy is confused because he thought maybe she wanted to get pregnant soon, but he didn't act on that. Maybe he didn't realize the importance of her using her own condom. But if she was clear that she wouldn't proceed without using hers, then he should have complied. If he was okay with using her condom, why was he so insistent on using his own? Maybe he didn't trust her or her supply, but that's a different issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a shared responsibility. If she's providing the condom, he should use it if that's her condition. However, bringing his own is also normal. The conflict arises when one person is not willing to use the other's condom. If he had agreed to use hers, that would be respecting her wishes. If he didn't feel comfortable, then he should have left. But she got upset with him for leaving. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If she clearly set a boundary that he was uncomfortable with, maybe he's not in the wrong for leaving. But if he was supposed to respect her boundary by using her condom, then he is. But the problem is that he had his own and she wanted hers. Maybe the right approach is to use her condom if that's her condition. If he can't agree, then he shouldn't proceed. However, in this case, he did try to use his own, she said no, and he left. But he's now doubting his decision. \n\nAnother angle: If she's the one who wants to use her own condom, maybe she's more invested in ensuring protection. If he was okay with using a condom, then using hers should be acceptable. He might have overstepped by not backing down. \n\nSo, considering all that, if he was willing to use a condom but not hers, that might be an issue. The fact that she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he refused, might mean he's in the wrong by not complying with her condition for consent. Therefore, he should have respected her decision and used her condom, or not proceeded at all. But he left, which could be the right choice, but she's upset. Hmm, this is tricky. \n\nI think the key is mutual consent. If she said she wouldn't go through with it unless he used her condom, then he should have respected that. If he wasn't okay with using her condom, then he shouldn't have continued. But maybe he should have compromised. Since he had his own, maybe he could have used hers if that's her condition. But if he didn't trust her condom, that's another issue. However, in this scenario, he doesn't mention any distrust; he just thought she wanted kids soon. Maybe he didn't consider that she had valid reasons for preferring her own. \n\nSo, the answer might be that he is not in the wrong (B) because he left when she wouldn't agree to use his, which shows he respected her boundary by not proceeding. However, the alternative is that he should have used her condom if that's her condition. But since he had his own, maybe he's in the wrong for not using hers. \n\nWait, consent requires mutual agreement. If she's not agreeing to proceed unless he uses her condom, and he doesn't want to use hers, then there's no mutual consent. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for leaving. However, if he was supposed to comply with her condition for consent, then he is. But in reality, consent can't be forced. So if she's not agreeing to proceed unless he uses her condom, and he's not willing to, then neither is in the wrong for not proceeding. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom. Since he left, maybe he's not in the wrong because he didn't proceed without mutual agreement. However, the fact that he had a condom and she wanted to use hers might mean he should have used hers to proceed. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. I think the main point is that he should have respected her decision to use her own condom if that's her condition. If he wasn't willing to, then he shouldn't have proceeded. Since he left, maybe he's not at fault. But the friend called him an asshole, which is part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe he should have compromised. The key is whether he respected her boundaries. If she said no unless he used hers, and he left, then he's respecting her boundary. However, if he had insisted on using his own, that would be wrong. Since he left, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
