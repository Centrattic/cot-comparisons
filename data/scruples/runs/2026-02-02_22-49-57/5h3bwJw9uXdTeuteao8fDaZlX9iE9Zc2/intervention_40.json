Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He went home when she wouldn't let him use his, and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who has the right to choose the method of protection. In a sexual encounter, both partners have the right to express their preferences, but they should also respect each other's boundaries. Condoms are a form of contraception and protection, so the person using them might prefer to use their own for various reasons\u2014maybe they trust their own, maybe they have a medical reason, or just personal preference.\n\nThe guy had his own, which he thought was necessary. The girl insisted on using hers. He felt scared and left. But the key here is consent and negotiation. Sexual activity should be consensual in all aspects, including the use of contraception. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's method, they should communicate and find a compromise.\n\nIn this case, the guy left when she wouldn't let him use his. That's understandable if he felt uncomfortable. However, the fact that she was insisting might indicate that she's in a position where using her condom is a boundary. If he's not okay with that, then it's his right to leave. But if he agreed to her terms, then he should honor that. The problem is that the guy felt scared, which could be a red flag. Fear in a relationship isn't healthy.\n\nAlso, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's not on birth control and wanted to use her own condoms for effectiveness? Or maybe she wanted to track her own usage. But if she's okay with using the guy's, why the insistence on hers? Maybe there's more to it, like trust issues or hygiene concerns.\n\nThe guy's friend called him an asshole, which might be because he left in a huff. But the girl's friend's reaction could be part of the issue. If the guy felt pressured and left, that's his right. But if he didn't communicate his concerns properly and just walked out, maybe that's where the problem is.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: If the guy is respecting her boundary by using her condom, he's in the right. If he's not respecting her decision when she's firm, then he's in the wrong. But he left because she wouldn't let him use his. That's a bit of a conflict. The main issue is whether both parties can agree on a method of protection. If they can't, proceeding with the encounter without a mutual agreement is risky. The guy might have been wrong to walk out without further discussion, but he also had the right to set his boundary. However, in a healthy relationship, compromise is necessary. The fact that she said \"if not, leave\" is a power move, which isn't ideal. So maybe the girl is in the wrong for not being flexible, but the guy's reaction might be too abrupt. It's a bit of a gray area. But since he left and didn't proceed, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
