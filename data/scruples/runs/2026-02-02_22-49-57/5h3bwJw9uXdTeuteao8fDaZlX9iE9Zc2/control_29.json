Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not using the girlfriend's condom. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author went to his girlfriend's place with a condom he brought. When they were about to have sex, she said she had her own and refused to let him use his. He tried to use his, but she became persistent and even said she wouldn't have sex unless he used hers. Then she threatened to make him leave if he didn't comply. He left and later got a message from her friend calling him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nSo the key points here are consent, trust, and safety. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure, especially if there's any risk of STIs. If the girlfriend is pushing for her own condom, maybe she has a reason, like a preference for her brand or maybe she's concerned about the author's STI status. However, the author brought his own, which is also a responsible action.\n\nBut in a trusting relationship, it's usually okay to use either partner's condom. However, if one person is insistent on their own, it could indicate control issues. The girlfriend here is being very forceful, even making it a deal-breaker. If the author feels uncomfortable using her condom because he doesn't trust her or her supply, that's valid. But if they're in a monogamous relationship and both are STI-free, maybe the issue is about control rather than health.\n\nThe author's decision to leave might stem from discomfort with the situation. If he's not willing to compromise and she's not willing to agree on using his, then he's left with a dilemma. However, walking out could be seen as not respecting her wishes, especially if she's clear about her boundaries. On the other hand, if he's not comfortable with her insistence, he has the right to prioritize his own comfort.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction might suggest that the girlfriend's actions were overreacting. But the main question is whether the author is wrong. If he's in a trusting relationship and she's the one setting the boundary, not using her condom could breach that trust. However, if there's any reason to doubt her STI status or if he's uncomfortable, his choice to leave is justified. But given that the girlfriend is pushing for her own terms, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her wishes if they're in a monogamous, trusting relationship where she's not a risk. But if there's any doubt about her health or the situation is coercive, he's right to leave. The answer hinges on the relationship's context and trust levels. Since the story doesn't mention STI concerns, maybe the author is wrong for leaving when she set the boundary. But if he had reasons to be cautious, he's not wrong.\n"
