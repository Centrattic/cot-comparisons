Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author went to his girlfriend's place intending to have sex. He brought his own condom. When it came time to use it, she refused to let him use his and insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He refused and left, and her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and mutual agreement. The author had his own condom, which is responsible because it shows he was prepared. The girlfriend was insistent on using hers, possibly because she mentioned wanting to have kids soon. But if they're not in a monogamous or stable relationship yet (they've been talking for 3-4 weeks), using her condom might imply a level of trust or a commitment that the author isn't ready for. Also, using her condom might mean he's not in control of his own health and safety, which is a valid concern.\n\nWait, but condoms are for protection. If he's using his own, he's ensuring that the condom is his, which he trusts. If she's providing hers, maybe he's not sure about her STI status or her other sexual history. That's a valid reason to stick with his own. Also, if she was insistent to the point of making him feel like he had to leave, maybe that's a power play. But he chose to leave rather than compromise his own safety.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes in relationships, using one's own condom is a personal choice. If she was okay with using her own, then maybe she was more open to the idea of pregnancy. But the author might not be ready for that. However, using her condom would mean that she's the one controlling the method, which could be a point of contention. \n\nBut the main issue is consent and mutual agreement. The author had the right to use his own condom. If she refused to let him use his own and made it a condition, that could be seen as pressuring him into a situation he's not comfortable with. On the other hand, if he's not willing to compromise, maybe that's a problem too.\n\nWait, but he had already prepared his own, so changing at that point might not be acceptable. Also, using her condom could be a risk if he's not sure about her health. The fact that she's pressuring him to use hers might indicate that she's not respecting his boundaries. So, in that case, he's not wrong to leave. The friend calling him an asshole is probably on her side, but maybe she's in the wrong for pressuring him like that.\n\nSo considering all this, the author made a responsible choice by prioritizing his own safety. He's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
