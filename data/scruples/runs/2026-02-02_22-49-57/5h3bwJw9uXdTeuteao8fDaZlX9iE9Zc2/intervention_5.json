Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they were about to have sex, the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He refused and left. Her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If one person insists on using a specific condom, but the other is uncomfortable, there's a conflict here. The key points are whether the author had a reason to be cautious and if his decision to leave was justified.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend wanted kids soon, which might imply she's not using contraception otherwise. If he's not ready for kids and she's using her own condom, maybe she's trying to conceive. But the author might not want that. However, he had his own condom, which shows he's responsible. She refused to use his, which could lead to a risk of pregnancy or STIs if her condom isn't reliable.\n\nThe author left when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That's a boundary he wasn't willing to cross. Walking away is a valid choice if there's a disagreement on safe sex. Her friend's reaction might be judgmental, but the author's action was about respecting his own boundaries. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not ready for unprotected sex or using her condom (maybe due to STI concerns or not wanting to risk pregnancy), then leaving was his right. But if he's being controlling by not allowing her to use her own, that's another angle. However, since he brought his own, the issue is mutual trust. If she's insistent on hers, maybe there's an unspoken agenda. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's choice to leave because of a disagreement on condom use isn't necessarily wrong. Both parties should agree on the method. Since he had his own and she didn't want to use it, he had a right to walk away. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
