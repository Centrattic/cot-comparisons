Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter, but the girl insisted on using hers. He didn't want to, she refused to proceed unless he used hers, and he left. Now he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a personal choice and part of safe sex. The guy had his own, which is responsible. The girl wanted to use hers, maybe because she prefers her brand, or maybe there's another reason. But if he's uncomfortable using hers, maybe there's an issue with trust or past experiences. However, the girl is refusing to proceed unless he uses hers, which could be a power play. \n\nWait, but why would she care so much? She mentioned wanting kids soon, which is conflicting because using a condom would prevent pregnancy. Maybe she's not ready for pregnancy yet but wanted to have sex without a condom. But the guy brought his own, so maybe she's not ready to take that step, but he was. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent and clear communication. If the guy is uncomfortable with using her condom, even if she insists, he's within his rights to say no. However, if the situation turned into a confrontation where she refused to have sex unless he used hers, and he left, is that his right? Or did he overstep by not using the one he brought?\n\nBut wait, he had his own, and she wanted to use hers. If he's not willing to use hers, that's his choice. She can't force him to use her condom. So if he left because he didn't want to use hers, he's not wrong. But maybe the problem is that he was prepared, but she didn't want him to use his own. If both parties are supposed to agree on the method of contraception, maybe she had a reason to prefer hers. However, if he's not comfortable with that, he can't be forced to comply. \n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole is a red flag. Maybe the girl is pressuring him into something, but he's standing his ground. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If he had already opened his own condom and she's now refusing, maybe that's about control. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: the guy isn't wrong for not using her condom if he's not comfortable. However, if they had discussed contraception beforehand and he agreed to use his own, then changing that at the last minute could be an issue. But since she's now pressuring him, maybe he's in the right. \n\nAnother angle: The guy had his own, so he's responsible. She wants to use hers, but he's not willing. He leaves instead of complying. That's his choice. She can't force him to use her condom. So he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's more to it. If they had an agreement earlier, maybe he's breaking it. However, the post doesn't mention prior agreements. The girl just insisted at the last minute. So, given that, he's not in the wrong for not using her condom. He had his own, she didn't want him to use it, he left. So answer B.\n"
