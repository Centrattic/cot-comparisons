We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The scenario is that the group meets at the author's house now, and the guy Jim has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still had it during the first meeting at the author's house. Then the author banned him, and now some group members are split on whether it was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in private property unless the owner prohibits it. So the author, as the homeowner, can set rules about guns on their property. That's a key point. So legally, the author has the right to ask Jim not to have a gun in their house.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong morally or socially. The author made it clear beforehand that no guns would be allowed. Jim then brought it anyway, which the author saw as a serious breach. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they have the right to set rules. The others in the group have mixed reactions, but one thinks it was harsh. The author's action might be seen as enforcing their personal boundaries, which is a valid point. However, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially considering Jim had a permit and had carried before without issues. But since the author specified their house rules in advance, and Jim violated them, the author's action is understandable. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite being asked directly could be seen as a violation of trust, making the author's decision to exclude him justified. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
