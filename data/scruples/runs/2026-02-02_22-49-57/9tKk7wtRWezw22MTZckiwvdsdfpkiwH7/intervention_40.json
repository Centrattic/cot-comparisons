We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group moved their meetings to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim to leave his gun in the truck before the first meeting at their house. Jim didn't confirm, and later, another member told the author that Jim had his gun during the session when the author was out of the room. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he continued, leading Jim to quit. The group reactions are mixed.\n\nSo, the key points here are personal property rights and personal comfort. The author made a rule for their own home. Even though Jim has a legal right to carry a gun, the author has the right to set rules in their space. The author isn't banning guns in general, just their own home. They gave a heads-up, and when Jim didn't comply, they had to enforce the rule. \n\nJim's actions could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might feel unsafe, even if Jim is legally allowed. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule after being warned justifies the author's decision. The other group members have mixed opinions, but that's common in such scenarios. \n\nThe author's stance is about their own boundaries. It's not about Jim's rights, but their own comfort and safety. Since the author is the host, they have the right to set the terms. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
