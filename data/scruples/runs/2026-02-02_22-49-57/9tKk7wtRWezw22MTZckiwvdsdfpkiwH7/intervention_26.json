We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately before the first meeting at their house that he should leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't clearly agree, but then during the event, when the author was in the kitchen, Jim had the gun with him. The author found out through another group member, confronted Jim, and told him he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. Now, the group is split on whether the author was right. The author feels it's their house and their rules, and they took a firm stance because they're anti-gun. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, you can ask someone to leave your property if you don't want them there. However, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim is legally allowed to carry a concealed weapon, does that affect the situation? The author's house is a private residence, so even if Jim has a permit, the homeowner can set rules. But maybe there's a law that allows legally carried weapons in private spaces. I'm not sure about the exact laws here. If Jim was following the law, then maybe the author is overstepping. But if the author can legally bar guns in their home, then they have a right to do so.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. They might have a strong discomfort with guns in their home. On the other hand, Jim might see carrying a gun as a right (if he's in a state where it's protected). The author's decision to kick him out after one incident might be seen as harsh, but the author argues it's their house and the issue is serious. The group's mixed reactions add nuance\u2014some think it's fair, others not. \n\nAlso, the communication aspect: the author told Jim beforehand, but Jim didn't confirm he would comply. Then, when the author found out he still had the gun, they acted immediately. Was it necessary to kick him out right away? Maybe a second chance or a discussion could have been considered, but the author might feel that the issue is non-negotiable for their safety and comfort.\n\nThe author's stance is about their personal space and safety. Even if the legal side is a gray area, the author is within their rights to set boundaries in their home. However, if the law requires allowing legally carried guns, then the author might be in the wrong. But since the question is from the user's perspective (assuming the author is not in the wrong), maybe the legal aspect isn't the main issue here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong morally, not legally. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author is the host. The group members are split, but the majority seem to support the author's decision. The author's firm stance could be justified as they have the final say when it's their house. Kicking someone out for violating a clear rule (no guns) is a reasonable action, even if it causes conflict. The author's anti-gun stance is a personal belief, but they're enforcing a rule they set, which is their right.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to control their own home and set rules for their guests. Jim's actions violated the agreed-upon rule, and the author took appropriate action to maintain their comfort and safety. The group's mixed reactions don't negate the author's right to enforce their personal boundaries.\n"
