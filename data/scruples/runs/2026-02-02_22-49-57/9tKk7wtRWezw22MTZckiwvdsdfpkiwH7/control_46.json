We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group where one member, Jim, has a concealed gun and the host decided to kick him out for bringing it into the house. The host is anti-gun and set the rule before the game night that guns shouldn't be in the house. Jim didn't comply, and the host cut him off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the host's perspective. They own the house, so they have the right to set their own rules. Safety is a big concern here. Even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, being in a private home might mean different rules than in public. The host isn't a fan of guns, so this is a personal boundary. They gave a clear warning before the event, which is fair. When Jim didn't follow through, the host took action. That seems reasonable because it's their space.\n\nOn the flip side, Jim might argue that he has a legal right to carry in public, but private property is a different story. Depending on the location, some places allow guns in private homes even if the host doesn't know. However, the host made their stance clear, so maybe Jim should have respected that. The group's mixed reactions also show that some people see it as a valid decision, while others think it was too harsh. But the host's right to control their home is a strong point.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and their rules. The key here is whether the host was within their rights to enforce that rule. Since they communicated it beforehand and Jim didn't comply, the action seems justified. The fact that Jim continued to contact the author with back-and-forth messages might also indicate he's being antagonistic, which could support the author's position.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are upholding their personal boundaries in their own home. The host's decision is about safety and personal comfort, which are valid reasons.\n"
