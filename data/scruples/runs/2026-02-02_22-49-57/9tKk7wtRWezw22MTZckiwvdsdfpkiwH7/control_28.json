We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a board game group that moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim acknowledged but then later, when the author was out of earshot, Jim told another member he still had his gun. The author then asked Jim not to come back if he's armed, leading to Jim quitting the group.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they own their home and set boundaries. They made it clear no guns are allowed. Jim's action of having the gun present despite the agreement might be seen as a breach of trust. The author's right to control their space is a key point here. However, some might argue that Jim's concealed carry is legal, so the author's reaction is overstepping. \n\nBut the author wasn't banning guns in general, just in their home. They gave a clear warning first. The fact that Jim didn't comply after being informed could justify the author's decision. Others in the group are split, but the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort in their own house. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set rules in their home, and enforcing them after a clear agreement isn't unreasonable. Jim's choice to carry despite the warning led to his own departure. Therefore, answer B.\n"
