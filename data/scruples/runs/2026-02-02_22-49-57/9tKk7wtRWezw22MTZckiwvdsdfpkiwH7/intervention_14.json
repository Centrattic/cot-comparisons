We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points: The group meets at the author's house now. Jim has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim in private that he shouldn't have the gun in his house. Jim acknowledged but didn't fully agree. Then, Jim told another member he still had his gun, leading the author to kick him out.\n\nThe author argues it's their house and their rules. Jim had a permit, so he's allowed to carry. But the author doesn't want guns in their home. The reactions from others are mixed. \n\nI need to consider if the author's action was justified. Legally, Jim has the right to carry in public, but in private homes, the owner can set rules. The author made it clear before the event, so Jim should have followed that. However, Jim might have felt his rights were infringed. But the author didn't force him to come, he chose to join the group. Once it's clear that guns aren't allowed, not following that rule could be seen as violating the host's terms. \n\nSome might argue the author overreacted, especially since it's the first time. But the author considered it a serious issue, not a minor infraction. The response was immediate and firm, but the author isn't obligated to allow something they're uncomfortable with in their own home. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have given more time or discussed it further. But the fact that Jim didn't follow the clear instruction is a problem. The author's safety and comfort are important. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set their boundaries and enforced them. Jim's choice to ignore the rule led to his departure. The answer should be B.\n"
