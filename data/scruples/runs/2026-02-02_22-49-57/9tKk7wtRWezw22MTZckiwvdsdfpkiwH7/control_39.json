We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The question is a classic AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is hosting a board game group at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim before the first meeting at their house that guns aren't allowed and he should leave his in the truck. Jim gave a non-committal response. Later, it's revealed that Jim kept his gun during the event, which the author found out through another group member. The author then asked Jim to leave the group, leading to Jim quitting. The group reactions are mixed.\n\nNow, key points to consider: The author's house, their right to set rules. Jim had a permit but didn't comply with the stated rule. The author took action after a single incident, which some members think is harsh. Others support the author's decision. The user is asking if the author is wrong.\n\nThe main ethical question is about personal boundaries versus someone's rights. The author clearly communicated their rule. If Jim knew the rule and still brought the gun, he violated the host's terms. The host has the right to enforce their own rules in their home. However, some might argue that Jim had a permit and that the author could have handled it differently, like having a more open discussion before taking action. But the author's stance is about safety and respecting their space, which is a valid concern. The fact that the author addressed it after one incident might be seen as strict, but it's their home. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily indicate the author is wrong; it's about differing opinions. The author's actions seem justified given the context. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
