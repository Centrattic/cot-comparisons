We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the group moved to the author's house, and the author told Jim not to bring his gun. Jim didn't fully confirm, and later it turned out he still had it. The author then told him he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if Jim is legally allowed to carry a concealed gun in that area, he can bring it into private property unless the owner specifically prohibits it. The author made their stance clear, so Jim might have been in violation of that if he kept the gun on him. But maybe there's a misunderstanding about what constitutes \"concealed carry\" in a private home. Some states require a permit holder to be able to carry in private places unless prohibited by the owner. So the author's right to set the rule is valid here.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author is anti-gun and felt it was a serious issue. They made it clear up front that guns weren't allowed. Jim, even if he didn't explicitly say he wouldn't follow the rule, was supposed to leave the gun in his truck. However, he didn't, and the author followed up after being informed. The author's point is about their own comfort and safety in their home. It's reasonable for someone to not want guns in their house, especially if they have strong opinions against them. \n\nBut wait, there's a nuance. The author gave Jim a chance to comply before the first meeting at their house. Then when Jim didn't follow through, they acted. The split in the group's reaction is interesting. Some think it's fair because it's the author's house, others think it was harsh. But the key here is consent. When you host a gathering in your home, you have the right to set the rules for your space. If someone can't comply with those rules, they can't be part of the group there. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of immediately cutting off Jim after one incident, perhaps a second chance or a more open discussion. But the scenario says the author felt it was a serious matter, not a minor issue like snacks. That's a valid point. Safety and personal boundaries are taken seriously. \n\nAlso, Jim's response was to quit, so the author isn't necessarily kicking him out against his will. The author made their rules clear, and Jim chose to leave. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules. The other group members' mixed reactions might reflect different values, but the author's right to control their home stands. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their own space and to set boundaries regarding firearms.\n"
