We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group over a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts game nights at their house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim ended up keeping it with him during the event. The author then kicked him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he's allowed to carry in public, but private property is different. The author is on their own property, so they can set their rules. So legally, the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home. That's a key point.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author made it clear before the event that guns weren't allowed. Jim didn't follow through. The author had a reasonable expectation that their rule would be respected. Jim's action of bringing the gun, even if he had a permit, was against the agreed-upon rule. The author's response was to remove him, which is within their rights as the host.\n\nThen, the reactions of others in the group. Some are split, but the author's stance is about their own comfort and safety. The author isn't being uptight; they're enforcing a boundary. The fact that Jim continued to send messages after being asked to leave might indicate he's not respecting the author's decision, which is his own issue.\n\nAlso, the author's anti-gun stance is mentioned. While that's a personal belief, the main issue here is about enforcing rules in their own space. It's not about political views but about personal safety and boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They own their home, set clear rules, and Jim violated them. The author acted appropriately by removing him. The answer should be B (No).\n"
