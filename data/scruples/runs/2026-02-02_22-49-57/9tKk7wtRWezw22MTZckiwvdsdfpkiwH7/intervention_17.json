We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the context is a board game group that moved to the author's house. Jim, one of the members, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author, who is anti-gun, told Jim upfront that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim acknowledged this, but later, another group member found out he still had his gun with him during the event. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he was armed, leading him to quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nSo, the main points here are personal boundaries and safety. The author made it clear that guns aren't welcome in their home. Jim didn't comply, even after being informed. The author's stance is about their own house rules. But some of the group members think it was harsh. \n\nLegally, in the US, if someone is lawfully carrying (like Jim with a concealed permit), the author can't necessarily ban guns on their property unless there's a specific reason. But this isn't a legal question per se; it's about social boundaries. \n\nThe author argues it's their house and their rules. They took action after a first offense because it's a serious issue. But others think it's not a big deal since Jim didn't have a history of doing this before. \n\nI need to balance the right to set house rules with the social consequences. The author isn't violating any laws, but maybe overreacted? However, if they feel unsafe, even if Jim is legally carrying, it's valid to enforce their comfort level. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's action is justified based on their comfort and established rules. The key is that the author communicated the rule, Jim didn't follow it, and the author enforced it. That seems reasonable from the author's perspective, even if others disagree. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
