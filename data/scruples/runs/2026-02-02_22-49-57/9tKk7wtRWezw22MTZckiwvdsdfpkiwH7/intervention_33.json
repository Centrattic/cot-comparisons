We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is hosting game nights at their home. They have five people in the group. Jim, one of the members, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author, who is anti-gun, privately told Jim not to bring the gun into the house. However, during the first game night at the author's home, Jim had his gun on him while the author was in the kitchen. Another group member informed the author about this, leading to a text where the author told Jim to leave the group if he wanted to keep his gun. Jim then quit.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. One person doesn't care, one thinks it's harsh but fair, and another thinks the author was too uptight. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. They considered the issue serious enough to act on it immediately.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\n1. **Personal Property Rights**: The author has the right to set rules for their own home. If they don't want guns there, they can enforce that. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, people are allowed to carry in private properties unless the owner prohibits it. So, the author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave his gun outside.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author did privately inform Jim about their policy. Jim's response was non-committal, which might have led to the misunderstanding. The author had a right to enforce the rule once it was broken.\n\n3. **Intent and Context**: The author's stance is about safety and personal comfort. Guns can be a sensitive topic, especially for someone who's anti-gun. The author felt it was a serious breach, not a minor issue like snacks. \n\n4. **Group Dynamics**: Jim's behavior might have been a breach of trust. The author addressed it directly, which is reasonable in maintaining their own comfort and safety in their home.\n\nHowever, some might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit, implying it's legal for him to carry, and the author's reaction was too harsh. But since the author is the host, they can choose their own boundaries. Jim was aware of the rule and chose to disregard it, so the author's response is within their rights.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable request, communicated it, and enforced it when it was violated. The answer should be B (No).\n"
