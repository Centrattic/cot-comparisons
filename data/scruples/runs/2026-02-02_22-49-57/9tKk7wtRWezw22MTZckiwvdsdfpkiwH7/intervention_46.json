We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the key points: The group meets at the author's house. The author specified no guns in the house, and Jim carried one despite being told. The author kicked him out after discovering he still had the gun present during a session. The other group members are split on whether the author was right. The author's stance is that it's their house, so they set the rules.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect, in many places, homeowners can set rules about guns on their property. So the author has the right to enforce a no-gun policy at their home. Jim was informed of this rule, but he violated it. The author took action after the breach, which seems reasonable given the initial warning.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the author is managing a group in their home. They have the authority to set boundaries. While some might argue that it's \"harsh,\" the author's right to their property and safety is paramount. The fact that Jim continued to break the rule after being told makes the author's decision justified. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong; personal comfort and safety are subjective.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted because it was only one instance. But given that it's about a concealed weapon, which can be a serious safety issue, the author's decision isn't unreasonable. The author also tried to communicate privately first, which shows they were giving Jim a chance to comply.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they enforced a rule they clearly communicated on their property. Jim's choice to not follow the rule led to his own decision to leave. The answer should be B.\n"
