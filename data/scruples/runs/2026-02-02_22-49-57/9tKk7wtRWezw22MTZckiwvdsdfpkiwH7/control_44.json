We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. They want a simple A or B answer, but I need to think through it thoroughly first.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author hosts a board game group at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed in the house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. However, during the first session, Jim still had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out from another group member, texted Jim, and told him not to come back if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed, with one person not caring, one finding it harsh but fair, and another calling the author a shrew.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules, and not having a gun isn't unreasonable. They acted the first time it happened because it's a serious issue, not something trivial like snacks. Jim is now sending conflicting messages and propaganda links.\n\nHmm. Legally, in the US, concealed carry laws vary by state and locality. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry in some places. But the author is the host, so they can set their own house rules. Even if someone has a permit, the host can reasonably ask them not to bring a gun into their home. Safety is a significant concern here. The author made their position clear, and when Jim didn't follow it, they took action. That seems like a valid decision from a safety standpoint.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. If Jim was in a state where open carry is allowed but concealed isn't in private homes, but he has a permit, perhaps he's allowed. However, the author is anti-gun, so their personal preference is involved. The key point is that the author established the rule before the event. Jim might have been under the impression that he could still carry, but the author's rule is that he must leave it in the truck. If Jim didn't comply, then the author is within their rights to enforce the rule. \n\nThe group's split reactions might reflect differing opinions on gun rights versus personal comfort. The person who says it's harsh but fair might understand the author's right to their own space but think the action was too extreme. The person calling the author a shrew might think that not having a gun isn't a big deal since Jim didn't actually use it or cause harm. But the author's perspective is about control and safety. They had a clear rule, and Jim broke it. \n\nAnother thing to consider: Jim's response was to quit the group. That's his choice, but if the author's rule was communicated and Jim chose to ignore it, the author isn't in the wrong for upholding their boundaries. The fact that Jim is now messaging back and forth complicates things, but the initial action was about enforcing a house rule. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author had the right to set their house rules regarding guns. They communicated this to Jim in advance. Jim didn't follow the rule, leading to his removal. While some might argue about the severity, the author's main responsibility is to their own safety and comfort. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
