We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author hosts game nights at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author explicitly told Jim not to bring the gun into the house, but Jim still did. The author then asked him to leave the group. The reactions from the group are mixed.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that it's their house, their rules. They had a clear rule about no guns. Jim violated that rule, so they removed him. From a personal space perspective, people do have the right to set boundaries in their own home. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the host's comfort and safety are important. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim didn't bring the gun into the house, just kept it in his truck. However, the author's rule was about being in the house. If Jim was still carrying it on his person, maybe that's a different scenario. But the rule was about leaving it in the truck. If Jim had followed that, there wouldn't be an issue. The author found out later that Jim had the gun with him when they were out of the room, which might have been a breach of the agreed rule if the rule was to not have it on his person during the event.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about safety and personal comfort. It's their home, so they can enforce rules as they see fit. Even if others in the group think it's harsh, the author's right to set those terms isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the rule was misunderstood or if Jim thought it was okay to have the gun on him as long as it wasn't in the house, maybe there's a communication breakdown. But the author made it clear that the gun had to be left in the truck. So if Jim didn't follow that instruction, he violated the rule. The author acted to enforce their own space, which is a valid right.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries and took action when those boundaries were crossed. It's their home, and they have the right to decide who can be there under what conditions. So the answer should be B.\n"
