We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because that person had a concealed gun. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group usually met at a hobby shop but switched to the author's house. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told him to leave the gun in his truck if he came to the house. Jim responded ambiguously. After the first meeting, another member told the author that Jim had the gun on him during the session when the author was out of the room. The author then texted Jim, calling it disrespectful and told him he couldn't come to the house again if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. The other members are split in their reactions.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they have the right to set rules, considering the gun is a serious issue. Jim is now texting them back and forth, sometimes threatening to remove his number, other times sending propaganda.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author owns their home and can set rules about what is allowed there. Concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if the author said no guns in their house, and Jim was aware, then he should comply. The author gave a clear instruction before the first meeting, but Jim didn't follow it. The author then took action after the first incident, which is understandable for a serious rule. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim, having a concealed carry permit, might feel it's his right to have it on him. However, in a private residence, the owner can restrict that. The author's concern about safety and personal comfort is valid. The other members are split, but two seem to agree with the author's decision. The third thinks it's too harsh. But the author didn't kick Jim out of the group entirely; they just asked him to respect the house rule. Jim chose to leave, so the author isn't entirely to blame.\n\nAlso, Jim's continued communication after being asked to leave might be problematic, but the question is about whether the author is wrong for setting the boundary. It's a personal choice, and since the author made it clear, and Jim didn't adhere, the action is justified. The author isn't being unreasonable about their own space. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
