We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim upfront that he can't have the gun in the house, so Jim should leave it in his truck. But then, during the first game night at the author's house, Jim still had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out through another group member and then told Jim he can't come anymore if he's armed. Jim left the group.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. They didn't want any guns inside, so they made it clear. Jim didn't follow that, so the author kicked him out. The other group members have mixed reactions. Some think it's fair, some think it's harsh but not their problem, and one thinks the author was too uptight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author is the host, so they have the right to set rules for their home. Guns can be a sensitive topic, and the author is anti-gun. But even if the author is anti-gun, they can't force someone to not have a gun, but they can ask them to leave it outside their home if it's legal to carry there. \n\nIn the US, concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if Jim has a permit, he can carry in public places. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So the author is within their rights to say no guns in their home. Jim was told upfront, but he still brought the gun. The author then had to enforce the rule because Jim didn't comply. \n\nThe author's action was to remove Jim from the group, not just the event. Some might argue that one incident isn't enough, but the author is the host and it's their space. The other group members have different opinions, but the author's main point is about safety and their own comfort. \n\nIs there any legal or ethical issue here? Legally, the author has the right to their home rules. Ethically, it's about respecting the host's wishes. Jim didn't follow the agreed rule, so the author is justified in asking him not to return. The author isn't in the wrong here because they are upholding their own safety and property rules. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
