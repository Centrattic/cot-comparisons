We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun in his home. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they have a board game group that now meets at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim upfront that he couldn't have the gun in the house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. However, during the first game night, Jim still had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then kicked him out after being informed by another group member. The reactions from the group are mixed, and now the author is being criticized by some as being \"uptight.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to set boundaries in their own home and Jim's adherence to those rules. The author made it clear that guns weren't allowed in their house, which seems like a reasonable personal boundary. Jim, despite having a concealed carry permit, chose not to comply with the agreed-upon rule. The author then enforced their rule after the fact, leading to Jim leaving the group.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect, concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim had a permit, he might be legally allowed to carry the gun in public places, but the author's home is their private property. The author has the right to establish rules for their own home, even if that means asking someone to leave if they violate those rules. So, even if Jim had a legal right to carry a gun, the author's personal policy takes precedence in their home.\n\nThe other group members' reactions also matter. While some think it's harsh, others agree it's fair. The author's stance is about personal comfort and safety, which is a valid reason. Since it's their house, the author isn't obligated to host someone if they feel unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\nJim's response was to quit the group, which is his choice. The author isn't forcing him to leave; they're just enforcing their rules. The back-and-forth messages from Jim seem to indicate he's trying to argue his point, but the author isn't in the wrong for upholding their decision based on their personal boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They set clear expectations and followed through when those expectations were not met. The situation is about personal choice and private property rights.\n"
