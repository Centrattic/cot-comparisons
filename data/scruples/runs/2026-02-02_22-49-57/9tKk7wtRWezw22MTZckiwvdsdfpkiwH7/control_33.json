We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear before the first meeting at their house that no guns were allowed. Jim was told to leave his gun in his truck. However, Jim later told another group member that he still had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim, stating that this was disrespectful and that he couldn't come to the house again if he had a gun. Jim quit the group, and there's mixed reactions from the others.\n\nSo, the key points here are: it's the author's home, they set clear rules beforehand, Jim violated those rules, and the author enforced their own rule. The question is whether that makes the author in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, the author has the right to set their own house rules. Even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, the author can decide not to allow guns in their home. It's a private residence, so the author isn't obligated to allow someone to carry a gun there. The author gave a heads-up before the meeting, so there's no indication that Jim wasn't aware. When Jim broke the rule, the author had the right to enforce it.\n\nEmotionally, some might think it's harsh, but the author's stance is about personal safety and comfort. The author didn't just kick Jim out on a whim; they warned him first. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The author's own safety is a valid concern here.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They had the right to set their rules for their home and enforce them after a violation.\n"
