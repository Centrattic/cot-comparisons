We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is the host of a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, but Jim didn't clearly confirm. Later, the author finds out Jim had his gun there anyway, so they kicked him out. The reactions are mixed among the group.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house, so they can set the rules. They're against guns, and they took a firm stance. Jim didn't comply, so he left. The other members have varying opinions, but the author is being criticized by some as being too uptight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in the US, as a private homeowner, the author can set rules about firearms on their property. So if they don't want guns in their house, they can require that. However, there's a nuance: some states have \"guests must be allowed to carry\" laws, but that's usually for concealed carry in public places. Since it's a private residence, the host can generally prohibit weapons unless there's a specific law requiring otherwise. But I should check that. If the author is in a state where guests can carry in private homes, then maybe not. But the author clearly communicated the rule, and Jim didn't follow it. So the author is within their rights.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, the author is making a personal choice about their comfort zone. Guns are a sensitive topic. Even if the author is anti-gun, enforcing their own space is a personal right. However, some might argue that it's a hobby group and excluding someone over a concealed carry permit is harsh. But the author is the host and has the right to their own space.\n\nJim's response was to leave, which he did. The author isn't forcing him to leave, he's choosing to leave because he can't follow the rules. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The other group members' mixed reactions don't make the author wrong; it's about personal preference.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to their own rules in their home, and they communicated it clearly. The issue here is about personal choice and property rights.\n"
