We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts game nights at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand to leave his gun in the truck. Jim agreed somewhat, but later someone else told the author that Jim was still carrying the gun while they were in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come again if he had a gun. Jim left the group. The group's reactions are mixed, and Jim is still texting the author with conflicting messages.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal property rights and the author's right to set rules for their home. In the US, as far as I know, the second amendment allows for carrying concealed weapons where legal, but it's also up to the property owner to set rules about firearms on their land. So if the author doesn't want guns in their house, they can enforce that, even if Jim is legally allowed to carry it elsewhere. \n\nJim might have a right to carry in public, but when entering someone else's private property, the host can set their own rules. The author made it clear beforehand that guns weren't allowed. Jim didn't follow that rule, so the author followed through on their warning. \n\nThe author isn't violating any laws here. They're asserting their right to have their home as a gun-free space. The fact that Jim didn't comply after being warned is his issue. The author's action was enforcing their own rules, which is reasonable. Even though some in the group think it's harsh, the author's stance is about safety and comfort in their own home. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're upholding their right to set boundaries on their property. The other person's reaction, while maybe not pleasant, was a consequence of not respecting those boundaries.\n"
