We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the group moved to the author's house. The author is anti-gun, which is a personal stance. They told Jim privately that no guns would be allowed in their house. Jim had a concealed carry permit and was carrying. The author asked him to leave the gun in his truck if he brought it. Jim responded in a way that wasn't exactly agreeable. Then, after the first game night, someone told the author that Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author texted Jim, told him it was disrespectful, and said he couldn't come again if he had a gun. Jim quit, and there's mixed reactions from the group.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's home, their right to set rules, and the issue of concealed carry laws. Let me think about the laws. In many places, concealed carry is legal, and people can carry in private homes if the homeowner allows it. But the author didn't allow it. So the author is within their rights to set that rule. However, some might argue that since Jim had a permit, he could carry in public places, but private homes are different. The author made their position clear. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author enforced it. \n\nBut did the author give Jim a chance to comply? They told him beforehand, and then after the fact, when he didn't follow, they kicked him out. That seems reasonable. The author's stance is about safety and comfort in their own home. Even if someone else disagrees, it's their house. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's decision is based on their own comfort and safety. \n\nHowever, maybe some would say that the author overreacted because it was a hobby group and not a dangerous situation. But the author emphasizes that guns are a serious matter, not a trivial issue like snacks. That makes sense because guns are inherently more sensitive. Jim continued to text the author with back-and-forth messages and propaganda, indicating he might not have respected the author's decision, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is setting boundaries for their own space. It's their right to decide who can and cannot be there. Jim had the choice to comply or leave. The author isn't violating any laws by asking him to leave. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
