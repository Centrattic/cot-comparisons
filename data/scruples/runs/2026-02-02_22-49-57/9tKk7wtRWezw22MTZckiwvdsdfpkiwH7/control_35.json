We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a hobby group where one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun to the meetings, which are now at the author's house. The author is anti-gun but had only mentioned once before that they don't want guns in their house. Jim didn't explicitly confirm he would follow that, and later someone else told the author that Jim had his gun with him when the author wasn't there. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, and Jim left. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if Jim has a valid permit, he's allowed to carry in most places. However, private property can have rules. The author's house is private, so they can set rules about guns. So legally, the author might be within their rights to ask him not to bring a gun, but Jim might have the right to carry it if the author didn't have a clear no-guns policy in place.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author mentioned their house and their rules, so they might feel it's their right to enforce that. But maybe they could have been more explicit about the rules before the first meeting. However, they did tell Jim privately beforehand. When Jim brought it up again, the author took action, which could be seen as enforcing their own space. On the other hand, some might say the author overreacted to one incident, especially if the group was otherwise friendly. But the author's perspective is that safety is important, and they made their stance clear.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions: some think it's harsh but fair, others don't care, and one thinks the author was too uptight. The author's argument is that it's their house and their rules. The key points are the author's right to set boundaries in their home versus Jim's right to carry a gun with a permit.\n\nSo, if the author had communicated the rule clearly and Jim didn't respect it after being told, the author might be justified in removing him. However, if Jim believed he could carry in the author's house because of his permit, there might be a misunderstanding. But since it's private property, the owner can set terms. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
