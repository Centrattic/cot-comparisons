We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) who kicked someone out of their hobby group for carrying a concealed gun is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told Jim beforehand not to bring his gun into their house, but Jim still had it with him during a game night. The author then asked him to leave, and the rest of the group is split on whether that was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state and local regulations. If Jim has a valid concealed carry permit, he might legally be allowed to have his gun on him in private residences unless the owner specifically prohibits it. However, the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed in their home. So if the author communicated that rule to Jim before the event, then Jim's presence with a gun might not be a legal right but a personal choice to follow the host's rules.\n\nFrom a personal safety and comfort perspective, the author is within their rights as the homeowner to set boundaries. Guns can be a sensitive issue, and the author's stance as anti-gun is a personal belief. The fact that the author addressed it after the first incident and then followed through shows they made their position clear. Jim's choice to ignore the rule and continue carrying could be seen as a violation of the host's terms.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions are interesting. Some see it as fair, others as too harsh. But the key point is that the author enforced their own rules. Since it's their home, they have the authority to decide who can enter under what conditions. Jim's continued presence after being warned might be seen as a breach of trust or respect for the host's space.\n\nHowever, there's a potential nuance here. If the location where the meetings were held before was in a bad area, perhaps Jim felt the need for a gun for safety. But moving to the author's house might change that dynamic. The author's right to their own safety and comfort in their home should be respected, especially if they were not aware of the gun beforehand.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their rules, Jim didn't comply, and the author took action to protect their space. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
