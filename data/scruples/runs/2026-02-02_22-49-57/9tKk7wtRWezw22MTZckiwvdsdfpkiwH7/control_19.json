We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun during meetings at the author's home.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is anti-gun but hadn't mentioned this before. They privately told Jim that guns aren't allowed in their house, so he should leave his in the truck. Jim gave a non-committal response. Later, another group member tells the author that Jim still had his gun with him while they were in the house. The author then texts Jim, saying it's disrespectful and he can't come anymore. Jim quits. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They consider the gun issue serious, not trivial. Jim is sending conflicting messages afterward.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are property rights and mutual respect in group dynamics. Since it's the author's home, they have the right to set rules about what's allowed. Jim was informed beforehand but still brought the gun, which the author saw as a violation of their personal space and safety. \n\nHowever, some might argue that Jim's right to carry a concealed gun is protected by law in many places. But the situation is about the author's personal comfort and safety in their home. The author gave a clear warning, and Jim's actions after that could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe other group members' reactions are split. One person thinks it's harsh, another supports the author, and the third is neutral. But the author's decision is based on their own comfort and the rules they set for their home. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made their position known, and Jim didn't comply. The author then enforced their rule. While some might say the author was too quick to kick someone out, others would agree that it's their right to enforce such a rule. \n\nSo, considering the author's ownership of the space and prior communication of the rule, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
