We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author hosts a board game group. They moved to their house because the shop was in a bad area. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author, who's anti-gun, told Jim beforehand that he couldn't have the gun in the house. Jim responded vaguely. Then, after the first game night, another member says Jim had the gun with him when the author was out. The author confronts Jim, tells him he can't come if he's armed, and Jim quits. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns there. Jim is sending conflicting messages and propaganda now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry in public places. But private property rules can vary. Some states allow property owners to prohibit guns on their land, even if the person has a permit. Others might not. So if the author's state allows them to set that rule, then they're within their rights.\n\nBut even if it's legal, is it morally wrong? The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. Jim might feel that his rights are being infringed. However, since it's the author's home, they have the authority to set their boundaries. The author gave a clear warning before the first event, so Jim knew the rules. When he breached that, the author had to enforce the rule. It's about personal comfort and safety. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions are interesting. Some think it's harsh but fair, others don't care. But the key point is the author's right to their own space. If someone objects to being around guns, they're justified in setting that boundary. The author didn't kick Jim out publicly; they just set a rule that Jim couldn't follow. Jim chose to leave, not the author. \n\nJim's continued texting and sending propaganda might be a red herring, but it doesn't change the initial situation. The author isn't in the wrong if they legally and respectfully enforced their home rules. Unless there was some legal violation, which isn't clear here, the author acted within their rights and personal comfort.\n"
