We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author has the right to set rules for their own home. It's their house, so they can decide what's allowed. Jim had a concealed carry permit, but the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed at their house. Jim didn't comply, even after being told. The author sent a clear message that if he didn't follow the rule, he couldn't come over. When he didn't, the author excluded him. \n\nThe conflict here is about personal safety and comfort. The author is anti-gun, which is a personal belief, but the key issue is about respecting the host's rules. Jim didn't honor the agreement, so the author followed through on their stated rule. The other group members have mixed reactions, but that's common in such situations. \n\nLegally, in many places, you can't be forced to allow someone to carry a gun on your private property if you don't want to. The author isn't violating any laws by setting that boundary. Ethically, it's about respect for personal space. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules. So the answer should be B.\n"
