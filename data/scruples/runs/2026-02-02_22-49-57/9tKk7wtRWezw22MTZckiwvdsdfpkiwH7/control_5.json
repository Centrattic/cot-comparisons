We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group where the host, the author, kicked someone out for having a concealed gun in their house. The author is anti-gun and set a rule that no guns are allowed in their home. Jim, the guy with the concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck, but he brought it anyway during the first game night at the author's house. The author then kicked him out, and the group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's right to set rules in their own home versus Jim's right to carry a concealed weapon. The author made it clear upfront that guns weren't allowed, and Jim didn't comply. So the author is enforcing their own house rules. Legally, in the US, the owner of a property can set rules about weapons on their premises. So the author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave the gun in his truck.\n\nBut wait, does a concealed carry permit override that? I think even with a permit, the property owner can prohibit guns in their home. So the author is within their rights. Then there's the moral aspect. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. They communicated the rule before the event, so Jim was aware. He still chose to bring the gun, which shows a disregard for the author's rules. The author's reaction was to kick him out after the first incident, which is a firm stance but perhaps reasonable given the seriousness of the issue. The other group members have mixed reactions, but that's common in such situations.\n\nJim's response was abrupt, and he's sending conflicting messages and propaganda links, which might indicate he's not handling the situation well either. The author's point about it being their house and their rules is a strong argument. Also, the author didn't make a big deal about minor issues, but a gun is a significant safety concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
