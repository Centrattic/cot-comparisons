We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts game nights at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, and Jim was supposed to leave his gun in his truck. Then, after the first game night at the author's house, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author confronted Jim, leading to Jim quitting the group.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house, their rules. They don't want guns in their home, and they enforced that rule once it was violated. Jim, on the other hand, felt it was a problem because he has a concealed carry permit and maybe felt his rights were being infringed. \n\nNow, considering the laws around concealed carry. In some places, allowing someone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon might require the property owner's permission. The author is the host, so they have the right to set their own rules for their home. If the state allows the author to restrict guns on their property, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe author did give Jim a warning beforehand, asking him to leave the gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply, which the author saw as a breach of trust and a safety issue. The author's reaction was to remove him from the group, which is a personal choice, not a legal matter. \n\nThe other group members' reactions are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. But legally, the author isn't violating any laws by enforcing their rule. Ethically, it's about personal boundaries. The author made it clear it's their house, and they didn't want guns there. Jim chose to leave when confronted, so the author isn't forcing him out against his will. \n\nThere's no mention of aggression or any incident where the gun was a threat. It's more about the principle of safety and comfort. The author feels unsafe, so they acted to protect their space. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because they set clear boundaries for their home and followed through when those boundaries were crossed. The decision is based on their right to control their property and personal comfort, not on any legal violation by Jim's side if the state allows him to carry. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
