We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the context: The group moved to the author's house. The author told Jim in private that he couldn't have his gun in the house. Jim didn't clearly confirm. Then after a game night, someone found out Jim still had his gun when the author was out of earshot. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he kept the gun. Jim left, and the group has mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns there. So, was the author wrong? Well, the right to control one's property is pretty strong. People usually respect that. Jim had a concealed carry permit, which means he has the right to carry, but that doesn't mean he can have it in someone's home unless allowed. The author made their expectations clear. Jim didn't comply, so the author took action. The author didn't act on a whim\u2014they had a private conversation first, then acted after the violation. The other group members have mixed opinions, but that's common in such situations.\n\nNow, possible counterarguments: Some might say that Jim didn't actually have the gun in the house, just on him. But the author's concern is about having weapons in their home, so even if it's on his person, it's against the house rules. Also, Jim might have felt he needed the gun for safety, but the author's right to set terms for their home is key here. \n\nAnother point: The author gave a clear warning first, which is fair. Jim's response was to not come back, so he didn't have to leave. The author isn't forcing him out; he's choosing to leave after being told the rules. The author isn't at fault for enforcing their own rules. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
