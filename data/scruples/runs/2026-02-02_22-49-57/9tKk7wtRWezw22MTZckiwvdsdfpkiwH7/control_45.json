We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a board game group that moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that they don't want guns in their home, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim gave a response that wasn't fully affirmative. Then, after the first game night at the author's house, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him while the author was out of the room. The author texted Jim, said he was disrespectful, and told him he couldn't come if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. The reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and their rules. They think it's not unreasonable to not have a gun in their home. They took action when the rule was broken once. Jim is now sending mixed messages and propaganda.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author made their stance clear in advance. They communicated that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim, despite having a concealed carry permit, didn't follow that rule once. The author then enforced the rule by asking him to leave. It's their home, so they have the right to set rules for their property. Jim's actions violated that rule, so the author's response is about enforcing their own boundaries. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim had a permit and was carrying legally. However, the author's comfort and safety in their own home are also valid. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author can set rules for their private space. The author didn't kick him out publicly, but gave a private warning first. When Jim broke the rule again, the author followed through. \n\nThe mixed reactions from the group members don't necessarily indicate the author is wrong. One person is indifferent, one thinks it's harsh but fair, and another disagrees. But the author's main point is about personal property rights and safety. Unless there's a law requiring someone to allow guns in their home, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They set clear rules for their space and enforced them when violated. Jim's choice to carry despite the rules led to his departure, which is the author's right.\n"
