  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is at fault for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun and made it clear that no guns are allowed in their home. Jim had a concealed carry permit and initially agreed to leave his gun in the truck. However, after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim still had his gun while they were in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim, and he quit the group. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if someone has a valid permit, they can carry in most places. However, private property rules can override this. The author's house is their private property, so they can set their own rules. If Jim was told to not bring the gun and did so anyway, the author has the right to enforce that rule.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author felt uncomfortable and unsafe, which is a valid feeling. They communicated their boundaries clearly. Jim's actions violated those boundaries, so the author's decision to ask him to leave is understandable. The group's mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong; personal safety is a priority.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was being too strict or uptight. However, since it's their home, they have the right to feel safe. It's not unreasonable to ask someone to leave their gun at the door, especially if it's a personal boundary. Jim's continued presence with the gun might have made others uneasy as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They enforced their rules on their property, and their actions were based on personal safety and comfort. So the answer should be B.\n"
