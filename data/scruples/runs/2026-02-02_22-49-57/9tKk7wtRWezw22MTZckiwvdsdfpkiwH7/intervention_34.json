We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a board game group moving to the author's house, and one member, Jim, carrying a concealed gun. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but later found out Jim still had it while they were at the house. The author then kicked him out, leading to some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, having a concealed carry permit allows someone to carry a gun in public, but private property is a different matter. The author's home is private, so unless there are specific state laws that override this, the author can set the rules. The author clearly communicated their policy, which is reasonable because it's their house. Jim didn't follow the rules, so the author had the right to enforce that.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author mentions being anti-gun but never discussing it before. It's their right to feel unsafe and set boundaries. Even if someone has a permit, the host can decide what's acceptable in their space. The author addressed the issue immediately after the first incident, which shows they took it seriously. The response from the group is mixed, but the author's decision was based on personal comfort and safety.\n\nJim's response of not coming back seems like he accepted the consequence, but his continued texting might be seen as harassment. The author isn't obligated to allow someone who violates their house rules. The key points are the author's right to control their property and the immediate, one-time enforcement of the rule after a clear violation. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted within their rights and communicated their expectations, then followed through when they were not respected.\n"
