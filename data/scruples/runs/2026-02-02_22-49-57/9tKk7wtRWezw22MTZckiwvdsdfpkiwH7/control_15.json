We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group has been meeting at a shop, but now moved to the author's house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told him privately to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out after finding out he still had the gun. The other group members have mixed reactions.\n\nThe key points here are about personal property and consent. The author owns their home and can set rules about what's allowed there. Even though Jim has a concealed carry permit, which is legal, the author is not required to allow him to carry in their private residence. The author made their rules clear, and Jim didn't follow them. \n\nNow, some might argue that Jim was within his legal rights to carry, but the author's house is a private space. The author isn't violating any laws by asking him to leave the gun. The author acted to maintain their safety and comfort, which is their right. Jim chose to leave the group, so it's not a forced removal but a consequence of not respecting the host's rules.\n\nThe other group members' opinions are split, but that's not relevant to the actual question of right or wrong. The author isn't in the wrong because they enforced their own property rules. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
