We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The scenario is that the author is hosting the group at their home and told Jim he couldn't have a gun there. Jim didn't follow through, and the author ended their participation. \n\nFirst, the key point here is that it's the author's house. People have the right to set rules for their own property, especially regarding safety. Guns can be a sensitive issue, and if someone is uncomfortable with them, it's reasonable to establish that boundary. The author even gave a heads-up before the event, so Jim was aware. When Jim didn't comply, the author took action, which is a valid response to enforce their own safety standards.\n\nNow, some might argue that it's a small hobby group and that the author was too harsh. But the author's stance is about their personal space and comfort. They aren't banning guns in general, just in their home. Jim could still attend if he follows the rule, but he chose not to. The other group members' reactions being split also shows that different people have different views, but the author's right to their own space remains intact.\n\nI think the author is justified in their decision. They communicated clearly, gave a chance to comply, and acted when the rule wasn't followed. There's no indication they were hostile or mean-spirited. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
