We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about them kicking someone out of their hobby group because the guy carries a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but didn't mention it before moving the group to their house. They told the guy Jim not to bring the gun, but then later found out Jim still had it with him when they were in the kitchen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but in many places, it's legal to carry a gun in private property if the owner allows it. However, the author made it clear they don't want guns in their house, which is their right. So legally, the author is within their rights to set that rule.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author communicated their rules, and Jim didn't follow them. The author is the host, so they have the authority to set the rules for their home. Jim's choice to not respect that led to his own exit. The author didn't act out of malice but to enforce their personal boundaries. The group's mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author was wrong; it's about their personal comfort and safety.\n\nSome might argue that the author overreacted because Jim didn't have a bad history, but the author's stance is about their own space. The continued back-and-forth from Jim after being asked to leave could be seen as him not respecting the author's decision, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They communicated their rules, enforced them, and it's their right to do so. The answer should be B.\n"
