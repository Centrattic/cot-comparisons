We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The board game group meets at the author's house now. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told him upfront that guns aren't allowed in their home. But after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim still had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author confronted him and told him not to come again if he brought a gun. Jim left the group.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house, so they have the right to set rules. They consider this a serious matter, not something trivial like snacks. The group reactions are mixed, with one person disagreeing, but others agreeing.\n\nNow, considering the laws and personal rights. In many places, concealed carry is legal, and people have the right to carry in public spaces unless prohibited. However, private property owners can set rules. The author's home is private property, so they can ask Jim not to bring guns in. Jim, having a permit, might be allowed to carry in public, but the author's house is private. So the author is within their rights to set that rule.\n\nJim's actions might be a violation of the agreement. The author told him to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't comply, which the author found disrespectful. The author's response was to ask him to leave the group. That's enforcing their own boundaries.\n\nSome might argue that the author overreacted because it's only one incident. But the author's stance is about safety and personal comfort. Others in the group are split, which shows varying opinions, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate someone whose presence they find unsafe.\n\nSo, the key points: Legal rights of the property owner, personal safety, and consent. The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to establish rules in their home. Even if Jim didn't break the law, he violated the author's personal rules, which the author is entitled to enforce.\n"
