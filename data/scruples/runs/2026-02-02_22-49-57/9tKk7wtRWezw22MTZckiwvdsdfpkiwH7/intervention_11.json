We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author hosts game nights at their house and told Jim privately not to bring his gun. Jim had a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author asked him to leave the gun in his truck. Jim responded with an ambiguous reply. Later, another group member told the author that Jim still had his gun during the event when the author was away. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun. Jim quit the group, and there's mixed reactions from others.\n\nThe key points here are about personal space and safety. The author's house is their private property. They have the right to set rules for their home. Even though concealed carry is legal in many places, the owner of the property can decide what's allowed there. The author made their stance clear beforehand and followed through when the rule was broken. Jim, despite being told, didn't comply, which led to the author enforcing the rule.\n\nSome might argue that Jim had a permit and was within his legal rights to carry the gun, but that doesn't override the property owner's rights. The author's decision is about their comfort and safety in their own home. Others might see it as overly strict, but the author isn't obligated to allow something that makes them uncomfortable. Also, the other group members have mixed feelings, but the author has the final say in their own home.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a rule for their personal space and acted when it was violated. The answer should be B.\n"
