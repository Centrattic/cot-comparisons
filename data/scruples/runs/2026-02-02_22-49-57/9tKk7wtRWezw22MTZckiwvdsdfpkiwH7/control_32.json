We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts game nights at their house and told Jim upfront that no guns are allowed. Jim apparently still had his gun during the session, leading the author to kick him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by state in the US. If Jim has a valid concealed carry permit, he's allowed to carry in public places, but private property can have different rules. The author's home is private property, so they can set their own rules. So legally, the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home. Jim violating that rule could be a breach of trust or the home's rules.\n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing their comfort and safety. Even if Jim is lawfully carrying, the author has the right to feel safe in their own home. The fact that the author communicated the rule clearly makes it a reasonable expectation. Jim's actions, keeping the gun despite the warning, are disrespectful and violate the agreement made before the event.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are mixed, but the author's stance is about their own space. The author isn't overreacting to a minor issue like snacks but a serious safety concern. Jim's continued texting with propaganda might indicate he's not accepting the decision, but that's his problem, not the author's.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made their rules clear, and Jim broke them. The answer should be B.\n"
