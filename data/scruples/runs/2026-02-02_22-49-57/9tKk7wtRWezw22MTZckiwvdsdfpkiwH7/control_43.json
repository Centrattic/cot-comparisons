We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about them kicking someone out of a hobby group because he had a concealed gun in their home. The group used to meet at a shop but now meets at the author's house. The author told Jim he couldn't bring his gun in, but Jim did so anyway after the first meeting. Then the author kicked him out.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about personal boundaries and ownership of the space. The author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home, which they have a right to do. They gave a one-time warning before the meeting, but Jim didn't comply. When the other member informed them, they enforced the rule immediately. \n\nNow, the question is whether this action is justified. Legally, in many places, as a homeowner, you can set rules about weapons on your property. So the author isn't in the wrong there. But maybe there's a social aspect. Some might argue that giving another chance would be more lenient, but the author felt it was a serious issue. They didn't make it a big deal beyond enforcing their rule. \n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others not. But the author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. The fact that Jim continued to ignore the rule after being told shows a lack of respect, so the author's response is about respecting their own space. \n\nAlso, the author didn't just kick him out publicly; they communicated directly, giving Jim the choice to leave his gun or not come. Jim chose to leave the group. The author isn't being malicious here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They enforced their personal boundaries, which is their right as a homeowner. The situation is about personal safety and comfort, which is a valid concern.\n"
