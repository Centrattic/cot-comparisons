We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The situation is that the group moved to the author's house, and the author told Jim to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply, and the author then asked him to leave. The reactions from the group are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home. It's their house, so they have the right to set rules. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author took action. The main issue here is whether the author overstepped or if it's reasonable to enforce personal boundaries regarding guns.\n\nOn the other side, Jim had a concealed carry permit, which means he's legally allowed to carry a gun. He might have felt that his rights were being infringed upon. But the key point is that the author's home is a private space, and while laws vary, typically, even with a permit, the homeowner can request someone to leave their property. So the author isn't necessarily violating any laws by asking Jim to leave if he's carrying a gun.\n\nThe author's response was immediate and firm, which some might see as strict, but given that it's their home and they set the rule beforehand, it seems justified. The person who thinks the author is being a \"shrew\" might argue that it's an overreaction if Jim didn't bring the gun before, but the author was clear about the rule before the first event at their house. Jim's non-committal response might have led to confusion, but the author had to enforce the rule after the fact.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to establish rules for their home. Socially, it's about respecting personal boundaries. The author did communicate the rule in advance, so Jim had a chance to comply. Since he didn't, the author's response was appropriate. The fact that Jim continued to contact with negative messages after being asked to leave might show poor sportsmanship on his part, but that doesn't affect the initial decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a rule, communicated it, and enforced it when it was violated. The answer should be B.\n"
