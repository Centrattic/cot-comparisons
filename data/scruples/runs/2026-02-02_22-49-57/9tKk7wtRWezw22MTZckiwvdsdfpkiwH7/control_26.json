We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong after kicking someone from their hobby group because of a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author hosts game nights at their house and told Jim in advance that no guns are allowed. Jim agreed but later brought the gun, and when confronted, he left the group. The author's friends are split on whether it was fair.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's right to set rules in their home. It's their house, so they have the authority to decide what's acceptable. Guns can be a sensitive issue, especially for someone who's anti-gun. The author gave a clear warning beforehand, which Jim didn't fully adhere to. When the breach happened, the author addressed it directly. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author was wrong. Legally, the author isn't violating any laws by not allowing guns in their home. Socially, it's about respecting personal boundaries. Jim's actions could be seen as a violation of trust and the agreed-upon rules. Even if others in the group think it was harsh, the author's stance is about safety and comfort. \n\nJim did have a concealed carry permit, but that doesn't override the host's rules. The author's decision to enforce their rule is a matter of personal safety and comfort. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they have the right to set boundaries in their own home.\n"
