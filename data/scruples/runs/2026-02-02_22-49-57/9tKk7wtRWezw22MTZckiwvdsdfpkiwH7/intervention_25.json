We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a board game group that's now meeting at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed at their house, so he had to leave his in the truck. Jim's response wasn't a clear agreement. Then, after the first game night, another member told the author Jim had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author confronted Jim, told him it was disrespectful, and said he couldn't come again with a gun. Jim quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed. The author now feels justified because it's their house and rules, but others are split. Jim is sending mixed messages and links.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was right to exclude Jim for not following the house rule about guns. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, right of the homeowner: In most places, the homeowner can set rules for their property. If the author made it clear that guns aren't allowed, then guests are expected to comply. Even if Jim has a permit, the author can enforce that rule on their own property. So from that angle, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of Jim's concealed carry. If he's legally allowed to carry, does that affect anything? Well, concealed carry laws usually allow individuals to carry firearms in public or private places unless the property owner prohibits it. So the author can indeed prohibit guns on their property, regardless of Jim's permit. So the author's action is legally justified.\n\nBut maybe there's a social consideration. The author gave a warning first, which is good. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author took action. That's reasonable. The argument from the other group member that it's \"harsh but fair\" suggests that while the action was firm, it's understandable. The person who says the author is being a shrew might just disagree with the strictness, but it's their house.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that a gun is a serious matter, not a minor infraction. They weren't upset about something trivial, which is a valid point. So their decision to enforce the rule was based on safety or personal comfort, which is acceptable.\n\nJim's response of leaving might seem abrupt, but if the author made it clear that it's a deal-breaker, then Jim's choice to leave is his own. The ongoing texting with mixed messages and propaganda might indicate he's persistent, but that's his behavior, not the author's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a rule for their home, Jim didn't follow it, and the author enforced their boundaries. The other group members' mixed reactions are just differing opinions but don't change the fact that the author had the right to their decision.\n"
