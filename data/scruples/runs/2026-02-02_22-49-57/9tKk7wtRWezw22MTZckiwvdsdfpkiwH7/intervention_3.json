We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points are: the group meets at the author's house, the author told Jim beforehand not to bring his gun, but Jim still did. The author is anti-gun and found it disrespectful. The group is split, and Jim stopped coming.\n\nSo, the main question is about personal property rights versus others' freedom to carry. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state, but if Jim has a valid permit, he's legally allowed to carry in places he's welcome. However, the author's house is private property, so they can set their own rules. \n\nBut the author allowed Jim to bring the gun initially, maybe not knowing. When they found out, they set a rule. Jim didn't comply, leading to his removal. The author's stance is \"my house, my rules,\" which is a common argument. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim had a right to carry where he's a guest, depending on local laws. However, the author can't force someone to leave if they're in a public space, but since it's private, they can ask. The author did set the rule first, so Jim violating it could be seen as his fault. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer hinges on ownership of the property and individual rights. Since it's private, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rules. So answer B.\n"
