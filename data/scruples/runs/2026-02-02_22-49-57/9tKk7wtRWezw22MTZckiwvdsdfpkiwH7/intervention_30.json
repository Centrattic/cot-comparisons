We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim that guns aren't allowed in their home, but after the first meeting, Jim still had the gun with him while the author was out. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting the group. The author's friends have mixed opinions, and now the author is seeking validation.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's house, their right to set rules, and the issue of concealed carry. In the US, each state has different laws regarding gun policies in private homes. Generally, private property owners can set rules about guns on their premises. So, if the author prohibits guns in their home, that's their right. Jim was aware of the rule but still brought the gun, which the author saw as a violation. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and they have the right to set the rules. They took action after a clear violation. But some might argue that maybe the author could have handled it more leniently, especially if it was a misunderstanding. However, the author's stance is that this isn't a minor issue, so addressing it immediately makes sense. \n\nAlso, Jim's response was to quit, which might indicate he respected the author's wishes, albeit unhappily. The fact that he kept texting with conflicting messages suggests he might not have fully accepted the decision, which is his choice. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're enforcing their house rules, which is a valid action. The answer should be B.\n"
