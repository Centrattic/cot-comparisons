We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person, let's call them the author, is hosting a board game group that moved to their house. There are five people. Jim, one of the members, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that they don't want guns in their house and he should leave it in his truck. Jim acknowledged but then later, after the first session at the author's house, another person told the author that Jim had his gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim, told him he was being disrespectful, and that he can't come over if he's armed. Jim quit the group. The reactions from others are mixed: one indifferent, one says it's harsh but fair, another thinks the author was too uptight.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules, and not allowing guns isn't unreasonable. Jim is sending conflicting messages afterward, like deleting the author's number and sending propaganda links.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider several angles here. Legally, in the US, if someone has a concealed carry permit, they're allowed to carry in public places unless there's a specific ban. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So, the author, as the host, can legally prohibit guns in their home. So from a legal standpoint, the author is within their rights.\n\nSocially, the situation is different. The author communicated their rules beforehand, but Jim didn't follow through, leading to the author taking action. The author's argument is about personal safety and comfort. Even if Jim was following the law, the author feels their right to have a safe space in their home takes precedence. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted because Jim had a permit and was following the law. But again, private property rights are a strong point here. The mixed reactions from the group indicate that opinions are divided. The person who thinks the author is a shrew might believe that the issue isn't that big, but the author's stance is about setting boundaries.\n\nI think the key factors here are the author's right to control their private property and their personal comfort. Since the author made the rule clear before the event and Jim didn't comply, the author's decision to remove Jim isn't unreasonable. Jim had the choice to comply with the rule or not attend. The author isn't in the wrong legally or socially here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
