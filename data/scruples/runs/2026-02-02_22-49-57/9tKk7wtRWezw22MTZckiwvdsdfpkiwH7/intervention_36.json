We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. But during the first game night at the author's house, Jim kept his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. Another group member told the author, so the author confronted Jim, leading to Jim quitting the group.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. They didn't want guns there. Jim's response was to leave, and now he's sending mixed signals and propaganda.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in places where concealed carry is allowed, the property owner can set rules about weapons on their premises. So the author can legally prohibit guns in their house. So legally, the author is within their rights.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the author overreacted, but others would say it's about personal safety and comfort. The author clearly communicated the rule before the event. Jim didn't follow it, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author made a firm decision, which is their right as the host. The other group members are split, but two think it's fair or at least not unfair.\n\nJim's actions involved not following a clear rule set by the host, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The author had the right to enforce their boundaries. Even though one person thinks it's harsh, the author's stance is about safety and respecting their space.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated the rule, and when it was violated, they took action to protect their space. The answer should be B.\n"
