We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their game group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points: The group moved to the author's house, and the author explicitly told Jim not to bring his gun. Jim later mentioned to another member that he had his gun with him when the author wasn't around. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading Jim to leave. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They didn't want guns there for safety, even though Jim had a permit. The question is whether this was fair.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, in the US, as a homeowner, you can set rules about guns on your property. So the author isn't breaking any laws here. They made their expectations clear, and Jim didn't comply. The author then enforced the rule, which is within their right.\n\nJim had a concealed carry permit, which means he's allowed to carry in public, but private property owners can prohibit guns. The author's decision isn't about Jim's legal right to carry, but about their personal comfort and safety. That's a valid reason.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was too quick to act after one incident, especially if Jim had always brought his gun before. But since the author specified the rule before the first meeting at their house, and Jim didn't follow it, the author's response is justified. The fact that Jim continued to carry without permission makes the author's action reasonable.\n\nAlso, the group's mixed reactions show that while some see it as harsh, others agree it's fair. The author isn't in the wrong because they established the rule in advance and enforced it when it was violated. It's their home, and they have the right to ensure their safety and comfort.\n"
