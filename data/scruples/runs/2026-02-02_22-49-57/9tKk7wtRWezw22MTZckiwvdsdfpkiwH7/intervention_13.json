We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking a guy named Jim to leave the group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author has a hobby group, and they moved meetings to their house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that guns weren't allowed at their house, but Jim didn't fully confirm. Then, during the first game night, Jim had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out through a friend and then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house, so they can set the rules. They consider the gun a serious issue, not like a minor infraction like wrong snacks. Jim is sending mixed messages about leaving the group and sending propaganda.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, in the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry in the author's house, depending on local laws. However, the author can set rules for their own property. If the author made it clear that guns aren't allowed, and Jim violated that rule, the author has the right to enforce it. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author gave a warning before the first meeting, and Jim didn't comply. The author acted on the first violation. Some might argue that it's harsh to kick someone out over one incident, especially if Jim didn't intentionally break the rule. However, the author's safety and comfort are important. Since the group is at a private home, the host has the authority to set boundaries. \n\nThe other group members' reactions are split, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. It's their house, and they have the right to prioritize their comfort. Jim's continued texting and sending propaganda might indicate he's not taking the author's stance seriously, which reinforces the author's decision.\n\nSo, considering that the author established the rule beforehand and Jim violated it, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
