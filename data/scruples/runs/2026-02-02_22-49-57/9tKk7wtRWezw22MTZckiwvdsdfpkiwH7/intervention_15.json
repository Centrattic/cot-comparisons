We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author had previously told Jim that no guns are allowed in the house. Jim's response wasn't a clear agreement, but he continued to carry the gun. After the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had the gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit.\n\nThe author argues that it's their house and their rules. They put the foot down after one incident. The reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal property and safety. The author made their stance clear beforehand. Jim didn't comply, which led to the author taking action. Since it's their home, they have the right to set rules about weapons. Jim's continued presence with a gun after being warned could be seen as a violation of those rules. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules. The split reactions from the group don't make the action wrong; it's about personal boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
