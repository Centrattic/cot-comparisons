We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points are that the group meets at the author's house, and the author is anti-gun. Jim has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't follow that, and when found out, the author kicked him out. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is ownership of the space. The author's house, so they have control over the rules. The author set a clear rule: no guns in the house. Jim didn't comply, so the author enforced the rule by asking him to leave. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, the right to bear arms is protected, but it's also a state matter. However, the author is the property owner and can set rules about guns on their property. So legally, the author isn't violating any laws by doing so. \n\nBut the ethical angle is different. The question is whether the author overreacted. The author gave a clear warning, and Jim didn't follow it. The author followed through on the consequences. The other group members have mixed opinions, but the author's stance is about personal comfort and safety. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and their rules. They made it clear before the first meeting. Jim's action was a violation of that agreement. The author didn't kick Jim out immediately but first warned him via text after the incident. Then when Jim didn't comply, they had to make a final decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Jim didn't mean to bring it into the house and that the author was too strict. But since the author had already set the rule, and Jim didn't follow it, it's a breach of agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They established their boundaries and followed through when those boundaries were crossed. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
