We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The key points here are about personal boundaries, safety, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the author hosts the game nights at their home. They clearly communicated their rule about not having guns in the house before the first event. Jim was aware of this rule but still brought his concealed gun. The author found out through another group member that Jim had the gun on him during the event. This is a breach of the established rule, so the author took action by asking Jim to leave. \n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, it's their right to set the rules for their own home. Guns can be a sensitive issue, especially for someone who's anti-gun. Safety is a valid concern here. The author didn't make a big deal about it until the rule was broken, which seems reasonable. They gave Jim a chance beforehand to comply but he didn't, so the consequence was him leaving the group. \n\nOn the other side, Jim might feel that he was being unfair treated because he has a concealed carry permit and was just following the law. However, the law regarding guns in private property can vary, and the host's rules take precedence. The fact that the author didn't make an issue before the event but enforced it during shows that they weren't targeting Jim specifically but enforcing a boundary.\n\nThe mixed reactions from the group are expected since people have different views on guns. But the author's decision was based on their comfort and safety. They handled it by setting clear expectations and following through when they were violated. That seems justifiable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They had the right to set their rules and enforce them in their home. The conflict arose from Jim not respecting those rules, not from the author overstepping.\n"
