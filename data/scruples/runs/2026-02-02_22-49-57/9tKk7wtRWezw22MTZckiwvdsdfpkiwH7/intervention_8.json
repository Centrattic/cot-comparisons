We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario did the wrong thing by kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author hosts a board game group at their home. They told Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, that he can't have his gun in the house and asked him to leave it in his truck. Jim agreed partially but then later, while the author was away, he still kept his gun with him. The author confronted him, leading to Jim leaving the group.\n\nNow, the author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They made a clear boundary about guns, and Jim violated that. The user thinks the author is right, but wants to confirm. \n\nI need to consider legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim is legally allowed to carry in public, does that extend to private property? Some places allow law-abiding citizens to carry in private businesses unless prohibited, but homes are private. The author can set their own rules. So, as long as the author isn't in a state where they have to allow concealed carry in private homes, which is rare, they have the right to prohibit it. \n\nAlso, the social aspect. The author felt unsafe and set a boundary. Jim didn't respect that, leading to the author removing him. The group is small and personal, so the author's comfort is valid. \n\nThe mixed reactions from the group: some think it's harsh, others agree. But the main issue is the author's right to control their home and enforce rules. If Jim had left his gun in the truck, there wouldn't be a problem. Since he didn't, and the author clearly communicated the rule, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author overreacted? But the user's concern is about safety in their home. It's their right to enforce that. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
