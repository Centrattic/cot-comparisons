We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun in their house.\n\nFirst, the key points here are ownership of the property. The author is hosting the game nights at their home. So, they have the right to set their own rules regarding what's allowed on their property. Guns are a sensitive topic, especially when it comes to personal safety and comfort. The author mentions they are anti-gun, which isn't the issue per se, but their right to enforce their house rules is important here.\n\nThe user communicated their rules to Jim before the first event at their home. They told him privately that no guns would be allowed. Jim's response wasn't a clear agreement, but he didn't explicitly refuse either. Then, during the event, Jim had the gun on him when the author wasn't around. This led the author to kick him out, which Jim then left the group.\n\nNow, the other group members have mixed reactions, but that's not the main point. The author's position is that it's their house and their rules. Legally, as a homeowner, they can decide who can and cannot bring weapons into their home. Even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, permits don't override private property rights in most places. The author took action when the rule was broken, which is within their rights.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. Did the author give Jim a second chance? The author confronted Jim immediately after the incident via text, which might have been a reasonable step before making him leave. Also, the author's decision to not allow any further meetings if Jim had a gun is a firm stance but justified if they feel unsafe or uncomfortable. The fact that Jim didn't comply with the agreed-upon rule is a problem. \n\nSome might argue that the author was too quick to kick him out after one incident. But given the potential safety concerns and the fact that it's their home, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their rules. The other group members' opinions don't negate the author's right to their own space. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
