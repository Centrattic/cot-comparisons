We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a board game group that's meeting at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed gun and didn't follow the author's request to leave it in his truck. The author then kicked him out of the group. The main question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They made it clear that they don't want guns in their home, and they asked Jim to leave his gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply, and when the author found out, they decided to remove him from the group. The author feels that it's their house, their rules, and that they had a right to set that boundary. They also mention that this is a serious matter, not something trivial like snacks.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim might argue that he has a right to carry a gun due to his concealed carry permit. He might feel that his safety is a concern, especially if he thinks the host's neighborhood isn't safe. The fact that the hobby shop was in a not-so-good area before might make him feel more security conscious. Also, he had carried a gun there before without any issues, so maybe he didn't think it was a problem to bring it to the host's house. However, the host has a right to set rules for their own home, even if it's a social gathering.\n\nThe group reactions are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. But the key point here is the host's authority over their own property. In most places, the homeowner can set rules about firearms on their premises. So even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, if the host explicitly states no guns, the guest must comply. If Jim felt uncomfortable with those rules, maybe he should have brought it up beforehand or chosen not to attend.\n\nThe author did give Jim a heads up before the first event at their house, so he was aware. Jim's non-committal response might have been a sign that he wasn't going to follow through. The author's reaction was to enforce the rule after the first violation, which seems reasonable because it's a safety issue. People have different comfort levels with guns, and the author being anti-gun is their personal choice. They're not infringing on Jim's rights by not allowing guns in their home. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the group is a mutual hobby, but the host's home is their own space. It's not about being uptight, but about personal boundaries regarding safety. The author might have overstepped if they had forced Jim to leave a public place, but since it's their private home, they can set the rules. The texts back and forth after show that Jim was upset, but the author's decision was based on their own comfort and safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to control their home environment, and setting a rule about guns is not unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
