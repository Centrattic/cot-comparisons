We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a board game group where one member, Jim, has a concealed gun. The author told Jim to leave his gun in the truck when they started meeting at the author's house. But Jim mentioned to another group member that he still had his gun during a game night when the author was out of the room. The author then kicked Jim out of the group, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author overstepped. The key points here are the author's right to set rules in their own home and the reasonableness of those rules. The author made it clear that no guns were allowed, which is within their rights. Jim, however, didn't comply with that rule, even after being told. The author's main argument is that it's their house and their rules, so they have the right to enforce that policy. \n\nJim's side is that he's legally allowed to carry a concealed gun, so he might feel his rights are being infringed. But the author's home is a private property, and private property owners can set their own rules, even if they're more restrictive than local laws. For example, even if a state allows concealed carry, a homeowner can still prohibit guns on their property. So the author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave his gun in the truck.\n\nThe group's reactions are split. Some think the author was harsh but fair, others think the author was too uptight. But legally and ethically, the author's stance seems justified. The author made their position clear before the first meeting at their house and gave a warning. When Jim violated that rule, the author took action. This isn't about being uptight; it's about enforcing a personal boundary in their own home. \n\nJim's response of quitting the group is his choice, but the author isn't obligated to let him stay if he's not following the rules. The ongoing texts from Jim might indicate he's upset, but that doesn't make the author wrong in their initial decision. The author had a right to set the rules, and enforcing them isn't unreasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
