We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author mentions that they told Jim beforehand that guns weren't allowed in their house. Jim acknowledged but then still had the gun during the event. The author then asked him to leave, and he did. Now the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made their rules clear before the event. Jim was aware he needed to leave the gun in his truck. However, he still brought it in. The author then took action after finding out from another group member. The main issue here is about personal property and the right to set boundaries in one's home. \n\nIn the US, the Second Amendment allows for gun ownership, but it's also about responsible gun use. However, the author's home is their private space, and they have the right to establish rules for their property. So, even if Jim has a concealed carry permit, the author can decide that their house is a gun-free zone. \n\nSome might argue that Jim might have felt his Second Amendment rights were infringed. But in the context of a private residence, the homeowner's rules take precedence. The author didn't make a public statement against all guns, just set a rule for their home. Jim chose to comply or not. Since he didn't comply, the author followed through with their decision.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed, but that's expected. Some people might not see it as a big deal, others might support the author's right to control their home. The author's reasoning is about safety and comfort. Carrying a gun in a social setting where others might not feel safe could be a valid concern. The author acted to maintain that safety, even if it's a small group they know.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They communicated their rules, and when those were broken, they took appropriate action. The answer should be B.\n"
