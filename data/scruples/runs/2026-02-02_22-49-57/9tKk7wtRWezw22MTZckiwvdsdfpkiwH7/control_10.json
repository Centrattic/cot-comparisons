We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style question is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation involves a board game group that moved to the author's house. The key points are that the author told Jim he can't have guns in the house, Jim didn't comply, and the author then kicked him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the author as the homeowner. In many places, as a homeowner, you can set rules about what guests can bring into your home. Guns are a sensitive issue, and if the author is anti-gun, it's their right to feel unsafe and set that boundary. Jim had a concealed carry permit, but that doesn't override the host's rules if they're not in a public place where concealed carry is allowed.\n\nThen there's the fact that the author gave Jim a heads-up before the first meeting at their house. They privately told him no guns, and Jim didn't explicitly confirm, but then later, when the author wasn't around, Jim still had the gun. The author confronted him, and he left. The other group members are split, but the majority seem to support the author's decision. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and their rules. Since they made the rule clear and Jim didn't follow it, the author took action. The back-and-forth texts with Jim after, with him sending propaganda, might be his way of venting, but it doesn't negate the author's right to enforce their own space's rules.\n\nI should also think about whether there's any legal aspect. In some states, you can't prohibit guns if someone has a permit, but that's usually for public places. Since this is a private residence, the author can enforce no guns. So legally and socially, the author is in the right here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
