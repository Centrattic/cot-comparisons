We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author has a board game group that moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim not to bring it into the house, but Jim still had it during the first game night. The author then asked him to leave, and he quit. Some group members are split on whether it was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim had a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to have the gun on him, even in a private residence. But the author is the homeowner and can set their rules. However, in some places, if someone is licensed, they can carry in private places unless the owner explicitly prohibits it. But the author did tell Jim to leave the gun in his truck. If Jim didn't comply, then the author has a right to enforce their rules.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. They felt uncomfortable having a gun in their home. Since it's their space, they're within their right to set boundaries. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule, even after being told, might make the author's action justified. Also, Jim's continued texting with propaganda suggests he took the issue personally, which might not be the author's responsibility.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like, giving a warning first or discussing it in a group setting. However, the author considered it a serious issue and acted immediately, which they might feel is necessary. The person in the group who thinks it's harsh might feel that one incident isn't enough, but the author's stance is about their home's safety.\n\nSo putting it together, the author isn't in the wrong because it's their house and they set the rules. They made their stance clear, and Jim didn't comply. The other group members' mixed reactions don't make the author wrong. Legally and socially, the author has the right to enforce their rules regarding guns in their home. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
