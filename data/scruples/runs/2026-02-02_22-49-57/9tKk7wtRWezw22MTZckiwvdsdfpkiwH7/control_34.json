We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation is that the author hosts a board game group at their house now, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim upfront that no guns are allowed in their house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim didn't confirm but later, while the author was in the kitchen, Jim told another member he still had his gun. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit. The reactions are mixed among the group. The author feels it's their house and their rules, while some think it's harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, concealed carry laws allow people to carry in private property unless the owner prohibits it. The author made it clear that guns weren't allowed, so Jim shouldn't have brought it. The author has the right to set boundaries in their home.\n\nBut wait, did the author have a right to kick him out? If the author made their stance clear and Jim violated that, then the author is within their rights to exclude someone from their property. The author isn't enforcing the law, but they can set rules for their own space. So from that perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Jim didn't explicitly bring the gun into the house, just had it on him. But the author's rule was about having the gun in the house. If Jim was carrying it on his person inside the house, that would be a problem. However, the author wasn't present when Jim mentioned having the gun. So maybe there's a question of whether the author's rule was about having the gun in the house or just bringing it into the house. Also, the author's rule was for the gun to be left in the truck. If Jim had it on him but not in the house, maybe that's different. But the author's rule was to leave it in the truck, so if he had it on him inside, that's a violation. However, the other person reported that Jim had it while the author was away. The author's response was immediate, which might be seen as reasonable because they had already communicated their rules clearly.\n\nThe split reactions in the group indicate that opinions vary. Some see it as fair, others as harsh. But the key here is ownership of the space. The author has the right to their own space and can set the rules. So, unless there's a law that overrides this, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: Jim might have felt his rights as a concealed carrier were infringed. But the author is a private citizen and can restrict guns on their property. So the author is not violating any laws by doing so. Therefore, the author's action is justified. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
