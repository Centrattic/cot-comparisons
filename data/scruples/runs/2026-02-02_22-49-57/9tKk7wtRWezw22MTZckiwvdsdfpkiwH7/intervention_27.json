We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group that's moved to their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim to leave his gun in the truck, but later found out Jim was still carrying it when they were in the house. The author then asked Jim to leave, and he quit. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They considered the gun a serious issue, not a minor problem like bringing the wrong snacks. Jim is now sending conflicting messages.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. In the US, laws vary by state. Concealed carry laws differ\u2014some states have \"shall issue,\" others \"may issue,\" and some are \"constitutional carry.\" The key point is that in many states, you can't prohibit someone from carrying a gun in their own home, but if they're on private property, the owner can set rules. However, if Jim is legally carrying, the author might not have grounds to kick him out unless they have a specific policy against guns. But if the author specified no guns on the premises, and Jim violated that, then the author could enforce that rule.\n\nBut here's the catch: in some states, even if a property owner prohibits guns, a person with a concealed carry permit might be allowed to carry there. For example, in states with \"constitutional carry,\" permits might not even be required. So if the location is in such a state, the author's rule might not hold. However, the user didn't specify the state, so we have to assume general US law.\n\nAnother angle: mutual agreement. The group initially met at a hobby shop, which might have had different rules. Moving to the author's home, they had to set new rules. The author did communicate their rule to Jim before the first game night. Jim either misunderstood or didn't follow it. The author's action was based on their own comfort and safety, which is valid. They made it clear it was a non-negotiable rule.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are mixed. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another doesn't care, and one thinks the author is being a shrew. The author's reasoning is about personal safety and setting boundaries in their home. Even if some see it as overreacting, the author had the right to enforce their rules. Jim's continued presence with a gun despite the warning could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author had the right to set a rule for their home. Jim violated that rule. The author acted to protect their space. Unless there's a legal obligation to allow guns (which varies), the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
