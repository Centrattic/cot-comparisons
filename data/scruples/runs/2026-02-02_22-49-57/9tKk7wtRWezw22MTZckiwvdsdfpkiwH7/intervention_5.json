We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that's moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that there can't be guns in the house, so he should leave his in his truck. Jim responded ambiguously. After the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim, saying he was disrespectful and couldn't come back if he kept the gun. Jim quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed, and now the author is dealing with Jim's mixed texts of ending contact and sending propaganda.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. They want to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the key points: The author's house, their right to set rules. Jim was told not to have a gun there but did so anyway. The author followed up after being informed, leading to Jim's exit. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and the rule is not unreasonable.\n\nIn the US, as a gun owner, Jim has the right to carry, but the author has the right to set their own house rules. Even with a concealed carry permit, the property owner can ask someone to leave if they're violating the rules. The author gave a warning and followed through when the rule was broken. It's a matter of personal space and safety. The author didn't kick Jim out without cause; they gave a clear rule and enforced it. The group's mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. Jim's continued texts seem to be part of the conflict but don't change the initial action's validity. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
