We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author hosts game nights at their home now. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't comply, and after being informed by another member that Jim had the gun during the event, the author told him not to come back if he's armed. Jim left the group. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by enforcing their personal rule about guns in their home. The author's position is that it's their house and they set the rules. Jim, on the other hand, might argue that he's legally allowed to carry and that the author is being unreasonable. \n\nBut in the US, as the host, you can set rules for your property. Even if someone is legally allowed to carry, the host can ask them not to bring guns into their home. The author made their stance clear beforehand, which is reasonable. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author enforced the consequence. \n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong. It's about personal boundaries. The author isn't violating any laws by setting this rule. The fact that Jim continued to bring the gun despite being told not to could be seen as disrespectful, which the author addressed. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set rules for their home, and enforcing them isn't unreasonable in this context.\n"
