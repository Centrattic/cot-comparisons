We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear before the first meeting at their house that no guns were allowed. Jim was told to leave his gun in the truck. Then, during the first session, Jim told another group member he still had his gun while the author was out of the room. The author saw this as a breach of trust and respect, leading to Jim being excluded. \n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and they set the rules. They drew the line because it's a serious matter, not a minor issue like snacks. Jim then quit the group. The reactions from others are mixed, but the author feels justified.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Well, the author communicated their rule in advance. Jim didn't follow it, even after being warned. The author's right to feel unsafe with a gun in their home is valid. They didn't make up the rule after the fact but set it beforehand. Jim's actions went against that agreement, so the author is within their rights to enforce the rule. The fact that it's a hobby group and they're using their home makes the author's stance reasonable. The other group members are divided, but the author's decision is about their own safety and comfort. So, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
