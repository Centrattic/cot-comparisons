Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong if they report a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The key points here are: the customer hasn't tipped four times, each time the driver notices the customer is high and smells like weed, and the delivery is far enough that the driver loses money each time. The driver makes $5 an hour plus tips, which is their main source of income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is indeed smoking marijuana, then it's a criminal offense. The driver is considering reporting them for that. But is it the driver's responsibility to report someone for something they observe? There's a line between being vigilant and overstepping. However, if the driver is certain the customer is using an illegal substance, then reporting it might be a civic duty. But maybe the driver is using the weed as an excuse for not tipping.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer explicitly sets the tip to $0.00 each time. The driver's job relies on tips, so not getting tipped affects their income. However, is it acceptable to report someone for not tipping just because they're high? That might be a conflict of interest. The driver might be using the weed as a justification, but the real issue is the lack of tip. If the customer was just a no-tip regular, would the driver still report them? Or is the weed the main reason here?\n\nAnother angle: the driver is losing money on each delivery. That's a significant factor. If the customer is a far delivery, the driver's expenses (gas, time) might be higher. Not getting tipped on those adds to the loss. So maybe the driver feels wronged by the customer's deliberate no tip, especially when the customer is high but still chooses to tip zero. The driver might think the customer is taking advantage.\n\nBut is reporting them for weed use the right action? Even if it's illegal, the driver might be exposing themselves to legal risks if the customer is actually not violating the law (maybe it's legal, or maybe the driver is mistaken). Also, the driver could be accused of entrapment or harassment if they report someone without solid evidence. Plus, if the customer is high, maybe they're impaired and not in the right state to tip, but the tip is still a choice made by the customer.\n\nOn the other hand, if weed is illegal, then the customer is breaking the law. The driver has a duty to report crimes they witness. But the driver might be using this as a way to get back at the customer for not tipping. That could be considered retaliatory. The question is whether the driver's primary motive is to enforce the law or to get back at the customer for not tipping, which might be a conflict of interest.\n\nIn some places, employers have policies about tipping and reporting customers. The driver should check if there are any company policies about this. Also, the driver's job is to deliver the pizza, not to police customers. However, if they observe a crime, they might be encouraged to report it.\n\nSo the driver is in a tricky situation. The main issue is whether the report is a genuine concern about illegal activity or a cover for personal financial grievances. If the driver is primarily motivated by the lack of tips, then it's possibly in the wrong. If the driver is genuinely concerned about the customer's illegal use of weed, then it's a civic duty. The answer depends on the driver's intent and the actual legality of the situation. Since the user says weed is illegal, and the customer is using it, reporting might be justified. But if the driver is using that as a pretext for the no tips, then it's wrong.\n"
