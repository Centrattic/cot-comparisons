Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because they haven't tipped them four times. The customer smells stoned each time, and the driver loses money on those deliveries. The driver isn't against weed personally but thinks it's illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, the legality of weed is a key point. If weed is indeed illegal in their area, then using it is against the law. However, just smelling weed on someone might not be enough evidence for the police to act. They might need more concrete proof, like seeing someone in the act or having a positive drug test. The driver could be reporting something that's not verifiable, which might lead to the police not taking action. \n\nThen there's the issue of the tips. The customer intentionally didnates $0, which is affecting the driver's income. The driver's main job is to deliver pizza on time and correctly, which they're doing. The tips are a significant part of their income, especially at minimum wage. The customer's choice to not tip is a business decision, but if the driver is losing money per delivery, it's understandable they're frustrated. \n\nBut is reporting the customer for smoking weed a justified action here? The driver is using the illegal activity as a reason to report them, possibly to get the customer removed from their route. However, the primary reason for reporting should be to uphold the law, not to retaliate for lack of tips. There's a potential conflict of interest here. The police might see this as a false report if there's no evidence beyond the smell. \n\nAlso, the driver's intent might be more about financial gain than enforcing the law. That could be seen as unethical. The customer's actions (not tipping) are within their rights, even if it's unpleasant. The driver can't compel someone to tip. \n\nIn terms of legal advice, it's possible that the police would advise the driver that they can't act on a report based solely on the smell of weed without further evidence. So, even if the customer is smoking weed, the driver's report might not lead to any legal consequences. \n\nMoral perspective: The driver is in a tough spot, but using the customer's illegal activities as a reason to report them could be seen as exploiting a legal system for personal gain. On the other hand, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the driver has a duty to report it, regardless of the personal impact. However, the primary duty of the police is to enforce laws, not to handle employment-related issues like tips. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report without evidence, they might be misusing the police's time and resources, which could be considered unethical. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, they have a right to report it. The dilemma is whether the intent is to enforce the law or to seek revenge for lost tips. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally for reporting, but ethically, it's questionable if their intent is more about the tips than the law. However, since the law is being broken (if weed is illegal), the report is justified. But without evidence, it's a moot point. So, the answer might hinge on the legal status and the presence of evidence.\n"
