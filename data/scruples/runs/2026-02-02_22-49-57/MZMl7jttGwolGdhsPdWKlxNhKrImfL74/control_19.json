Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're an asshole for reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and seems to be smoking weed. The key points here are the person's intent to report someone for a legal issue, the lack of tipping, and their financial reliance on tips.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The person is considering reporting the customer because they believe the customer is using illegal substances, which is against the law where they live. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income. \n\nNow, the legality of marijuana varies, but the user says it's illegal in their area. So if the customer is using it, that's a legal violation. However, the driver's role is to deliver food, not to police customers. But the driver is personally affected by the lack of tips and the long delivery distance causing a loss. \n\nOn one hand, the driver might feel justified in reporting because they suspect illegal activity. On the other hand, the primary issue is the lack of tip, which is a business-related issue, not a legal one. Reporting someone for not tipping isn't a legal matter unless there's another element, like harassment or crime. \n\nThe user might be using the weed as an excuse to report the customer for not tipping. But if the customer is indeed using illegal drugs, the driver could be doing a civic duty. However, the driver's main grievance is the tips. \n\nBut if the driver is motivated more by the tips than the illegal activity, that could be seen as wrong. The police might not prioritize this report unless there's clear evidence of a crime beyond just drug use, which might be hard to prove without seeing it happen. \n\nSo the driver could be in the wrong if they're using the weed as a pretext for their frustration over tips. Alternatively, if they genuinely believe in reporting illegal activity, they might not be in the wrong. However, the core issue is the tips, which is a different matter. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong because their primary motivation is the lack of tips, not the illegal activity. Reporting someone for not tipping is not appropriate, and using the weed as an excuse might be a stretch unless they have solid proof. The driver should address the tipping issue through their employer or customer service rather than involving the police.\n"
