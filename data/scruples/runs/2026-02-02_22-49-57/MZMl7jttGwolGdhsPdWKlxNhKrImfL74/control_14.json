Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who didn't tip multiple times and was smoking weed. The author is a delivery driver who loses money on each delivery to this customer. The customer writes $0.00 in tips and the author is considering reporting them for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the customer is smoking weed in their home, the driver might not have the authority to report them unless they see it in public. But the driver is just noticing the smell and possibly the customer's state. In many places, you can't just report someone for smoking weed in their own home, even if it's illegal. So legally, the driver might be overstepping if they report based on suspicion rather than actual evidence.\n\nEthically, the driver is upset about not receiving tips and losing money. However, using the customer's possible illegal activity as a reason to report them for non-payment of tips is a conflict of interest. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, and the customer's tipping is a separate issue. The driver's motivation here seems to be financial gain, which might not be the right reason to involve the police. The question is whether the driver has a valid reason to report the customer for actual illegal activity, not just for not tipping.\n\nAlso, the customer is writing $0.00 intentionally, which is their choice, though it's affecting the driver's earnings. But the driver's solution is to report for smoking weed, which is a different issue. So the driver is conflating two separate issues: payment and illegal activity. If the driver has no evidence that the customer is in violation of the law (like smoking in public or other observable illegal acts), then the report would be unfounded. Therefore, the driver would be in the wrong for using a personal grievance to falsely report someone.\n\nSo, putting it together: the author's intent is to report someone for not tipping by using their possible weed use as a reason. Since the driver can't legally confirm the customer's violation (if it's in private) and is using this as a means to get the customer to tip, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
