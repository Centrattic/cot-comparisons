Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells of weed each time, and the user is considering reporting them. The user is in a place where weed is illegal.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the person is in the wrong. The main issue here is the decision to report a customer for not tipping and for smoking weed. Let's break it down.\n\nThe user mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section. So it's intentional, not a mistake. The user relies on tips for income, making $5 an hour, and this customer is one of the farthest, causing a loss. That's a valid financial concern. But the key here is whether the user should report the customer for smoking weed.\n\nNow, the user isn't against weed personally but thinks it's illegal where they live. Let's verify the legality. In many places, recreational or medical use might be legal, so the user's assumption might be incorrect. However, the user's location isn't specified, so we can only go by what's stated. The user believes it's illegal, so if it's actually illegal, then the customer is breaking the law. But the user's role as a delivery driver: do they have the authority to report customers based on suspicion? \n\nSnitching can be a sensitive topic. If the user isn't law enforcement, they can't be certain the customer is smoking weed. The smell could be from something else. Plus, the user's primary role is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. Reporting a customer for something they observed during a delivery might be overstepping if it's not a direct threat or criminal activity towards the driver. \n\nThe user's motivation is partially about the lack of tips, which complicates things. Using the weed use as leverage to report them for non-payment is questionable. Even if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver's main issue is the tip. The appropriate action might be to address the tip issue directly, like politely reminding the customer, rather than involving the police. \n\nAlso, the user might be conflating two separate issues: the customer's personal choice (if it's legal) and their decision not to tip. If the customer is intentionally not tipping, that's a matter of business policy or personal ethics, but not a criminal matter. Unless the customer is doing something that's a crime, like using illegal drugs, then the user could make a report. However, the user's evidence is based on smell, which isn't concrete. \n\nSo, if weed is illegal in their area, the user might be justified in reporting the customer for that. But the user's main grievance is the lack of tips. It's possible the user is using the weed as a reason to report the customer because they didn't tip, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. Even if the user is allowed to report the weed use, the underlying motive might be unethical. \n\nAlternatively, if the weed is legal, then the user is incorrect in their assumption and shouldn't report them. The user's answer depends on local laws. Since the user is unsure if they are in the wrong, but the scenario is hypothetical, the ethical question is whether reporting the customer is justified for the purpose of getting a tip. \n\nIn general, reporting someone to the police for something that's not a direct threat or criminal act against you might be considered an overreach, especially if the main issue is financial. The user's actions could be seen as using the law as a weapon because they're upset about tips. \n\nTherefore, even if the customer is technically violating the law, the user's intent to report them primarily because of the tips rather than genuine concern about illegal activity could make them the asshole. The right course of action is to handle the tip issue separately, maybe by asking for a tip politely or not delivering again if the customer continues to not tip. Using the police for a tip dispute isn't appropriate. So the answer is A.\n"
