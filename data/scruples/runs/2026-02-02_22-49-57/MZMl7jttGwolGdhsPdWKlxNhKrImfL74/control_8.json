Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is often high on weed. The customer lives far away, causing the driver to lose money each time. The driver isn't against smoking itself but points out that it's illegal where they live. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether reporting the customer for smoking weed is justified here. Let's break it down.\n\nWeed's legality is a key point. If it's illegal in the area, then the customer is breaking the law. However, the driver's motivation here is financial. They're upset because the customer isn't tipping, and they want to report them for a crime because of that. That raises the question of whether the driver's intent is to enforce the law or to get revenge for not getting tips.\n\nAnother angle: Can a delivery driver legally report someone for a private activity like smoking weed? If the driver sees the customer smoking, that's a public act if they're at the door. But if it's private, maybe the driver isn't in a position to report it. Also, the driver might be using the law as a tool to punish the customer for not tipping, which could be seen as misuse of legal processes.\n\nEthically, using the police to address non-payment of tips is problematic. Tips are a social norm, not a legal requirement. Reporting someone for not tipping could be seen as an overreach. Plus, there's a risk of false reporting if the main motive is financial gain.\n\nAlso, the driver is in a position of service. The customer's right to use legal or illegal substances (depending on local laws) is separate from the driver's job. Even if weed is illegal, the driver isn't law enforcement. They might not have the authority to report unless they witness a crime in real-time.\n\nWait, the user says weed is illegal where they live. So the customer is indeed committing a crime. But the driver is using that as a reason to report them for not tipping. That's a conflict of motives. The driver might be justified in reporting the drug use if they observe it, but if the primary motive is revenge for lack of tips, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, the driver could argue that they're reporting a crime they witnessed. But if the driver only knows the customer is high from the smell and the customer's behavior, maybe they don't have enough evidence for a police report. Also, police might not take it seriously unless there's more to the situation.\n\nSo, the author's wrongness depends on whether their intent is to enforce the law or to retaliate. If they're primarily looking to punish the customer for not tipping, that's using the law for personal gain, which is unethical. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law and report it without malice, it might be justified. However, the context here is that the driver is upset about the lack of tips, which is the main issue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because their motivation is financial, and using the police to address non-payment of tips is inappropriate. They should address the tipping issue through proper channels, like the employer, rather than misusing legal means.\n"
