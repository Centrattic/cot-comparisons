Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe driver works for a pizza place, making $5 an hour plus tips. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the driver noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The driver is wondering if reporting the customer would make them an asshole. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's actions (not tipping intentionally), and the driver's financial situation.\n\nSince the user mentioned that weed is illegal where they live, reporting someone for smoking it could be justified legally. However, the driver's main grievance is about not receiving tips. The question is whether using the weed as an excuse to report the customer is the right move, even if the customer is breaking the law. \n\nOn one hand, the driver has a right to be compensated for their work, and the customer's refusal to tip is affecting their income. On the other hand, using the weed as a reason to report might be seen as taking advantage of the situation for a personal gain (getting a tip) rather than a genuine concern for the law. \n\nI need to consider if the driver's intent is primarily about enforcing the law or retaliating for not getting tips. If the driver is mainly upset about the tips but uses the weed as an excuse, that might make them in the wrong. But if the driver genuinely believes in enforcing the law regardless of the circumstances, then maybe not. However, since the customer is breaking the law by smoking weed, the driver could argue they have a duty to report it. But the underlying motive here seems to be the tips, which complicates things. \n\nAlso, the customer intentionally leaves $0, which might be a conscious decision, not a mistake. The driver loses money on each delivery, which adds pressure. But the driver's job is to deliver food, not to police customers. So there's a balance between legal responsibility and personal ethics. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, it might be acceptable to report illegal activities, but if the driver's primary motive is to get a tip, that could be seen as unethical. The answer might depend on whether the driver is using the law as a pretext for their personal grievances. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong for doing this. \n\nI think the consensus would be that while the customer is breaking the law, using that as a reason to report them over unpaid tips is taking advantage of the situation. The driver's main role isn't to enforce drug laws, so doing so for personal financial gain could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
