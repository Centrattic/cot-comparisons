Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times, and they suspect the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The customer always writes $0.00 in the tip section, and the author is considering reporting them to the police because they lose money on each delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is using weed, reporting them could lead to legal consequences. But the author's main issue is not the weed use per se, but the lack of tips. They rely on tips for income, and this customer isn't tipping, which is affecting their earnings. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer. On one hand, the customer is not tipping, which is a business issue. The author could address this by not delivering to them or discussing it with the customer. On the other hand, the author is thinking about reporting the customer for an illegal activity (weed use) that they observed. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author is not a police officer. They might not have the legal authority to report someone for a crime that they observed unless they are a witness to an actual crime. If the customer is smoking weed in their own home, it's a private matter. The author can smell the weed when delivering, but that doesn't necessarily mean the customer is breaking the law in the author's presence. Unless the author sees them using it, just a smell might not be enough for a report. \n\nAlso, the author's main grievance is the lack of tips. The weed use is a separate issue. Using the potential illegal activity as a way to get the customer to tip could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a genuine concern for the law. The author could be misusing the reporting process for a non-legal reason (getting a tip) instead of their own financial gain. \n\nIn many places, you can report suspected illegal activities, but the validity of the report matters. If the author's primary motivation is not about the law but about their own earnings, that could be considered hypocritical or unethical. The author might be in the wrong because they are using a legal concern as a pretext for a business dispute. \n\nAdditionally, the customer is clearly choosing not to tip, which is their right. The author can't force a tip, even if the customer is using an illegal substance. The author's job is to deliver the pizza, and the customer's decision not to tip, while affecting the author's income, doesn't necessarily make the customer guilty of a crime that the author can report. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not justified in reporting the customer for weed use based on the given information, especially when the main issue is the lack of tips. Their motivation is personal financial gain rather than upholding the law. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
