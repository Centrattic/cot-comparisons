Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong if they report a customer for smoking weed based on the fact that the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems stoned during deliveries. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a delivery driver who relies on tips because they make $5 an hour. The customer in question hasn't tipped four times, and each time, the author noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The author is considering reporting them to the police because they believe weed use is illegal in their area, and they feel it's intentional since the tip was set to $0.00. Also, the delivery is one of the farthest, so the author loses money on each trip.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer. Let's look at the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if weed is indeed illegal where they live, then the customer could be in violation. However, the author's motivation here is primarily financial. They want to get a tip, and they're considering reporting the customer because of the lack of tip, which is a financial grievance. But the act of smoking weed is a separate issue. However, the author is using the customer's possible illegal activity as a means to get a tip, which could be seen as unethical.\n\nBut wait, the author states that they don't have a problem with weed personally, just that it's illegal. So they aren't targeting the customer for using weed but are using that as a reason to report them because of the lack of tip. The connection between the two is the customer's failure to tip and the presence of weed. The author might be conflating two different issues. The lack of tip is a business issue, while weed use is a legal one. Reporting someone for a legal violation is their right, but using the lack of tip as a motive could be problematic. It might be seen as using the law to settle a personal grievance, which is a form of entrapment or misuse of authority. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the author's role. As a delivery driver, they aren't law enforcement. Reporting a customer based on suspicion without concrete evidence (like seeing them smoke publicly or having a police reportable incident) could be considered a false accusation. The author's evidence is the smell of weed and the customer's state, which might not be enough for the police to act on, especially if the customer is in a private residence. \n\nFurthermore, the author might be retaliating against the customer for not tipping, which is a valid concern for the driver's income. However, the method of retaliation by reporting the customer to the police for a possible legal offense could be deemed an overstep. The ethical question here is whether it's right to use a legal report as a means to get a tip. \n\nIn terms of the law, if the author has reasonable suspicion that the customer is violating the law, they can report it. However, if the author's primary motivation is to get a tip rather than a genuine concern about illegal activity, this could be seen as an abuse of their right to report. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the author isn't necessarily breaking the law by reporting the customer, their intent might make them ethically in the wrong. They're using a potential legal issue to address a personal financial grievance, which could be considered unethical. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their motivation is questionable and they're misusing the reporting process for personal gain.\n"
