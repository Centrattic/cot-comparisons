Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed, since that customer hasn't tipped them four times. The person is losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip, not forgetting, and they rely on tips since they make $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The user says weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is smoking during the delivery, maybe the driver can observe that. But how much can they actually observe? They might smell weed when they arrive, but can they be certain the customer is under its influence at the time of the interaction? Also, if the customer is stoned, does that impair them in a way that's a safety concern?\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer isn't tipping, which is affecting the driver's income. The driver makes minimum wage plus tips, so relying on tips is part of the job. However, reporting someone for not tipping is a stretch. The police aren't typically involved in non-tipping unless there's another illegal activity involved. The driver might be frustrated, but using the police as a way to force a tip could be seen as misuse of authority.\n\nAlso, the driver's motivation here is financial gain. They want the customer to tip by getting them in trouble for a possible drug offense. That could be considered an ulterior motive. Even if the customer is smoking, the driver needs to have a legitimate reason to report them, not just for not paying. \n\nAnother angle: the customer might not tip because of poor service, but the driver says the deliveries are on time and correct. If there's no issue with the service, then the customer's choice not to tip is their decision. The driver can't force them to tip. \n\nBut the driver is in a position where they can report the customer for a possible law violation. The question is whether the driver is justified in doing so. If the customer is indeed smoking weed in their home, which is legal for them to do if it's medical or legal in their state, but the user says it's illegal there. Wait, the user says \"illegal where I live,\" but if the customer is in a legal state, maybe the driver is in a place where possession is illegal. But the delivery is happening where the customer is, so jurisdiction matters. \n\nAssuming it's illegal, the driver might report them, but is that the right approach? The driver isn't a law enforcement officer, so they're relying on their observation. If they can't provide solid evidence beyond a smell, maybe the police wouldn't take it seriously. Also, the driver's primary issue is the tip, not the drug use. So using that as a way to get money feels wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the driver is using a possible legal violation as leverage for personal gain, which isn't right. The driver's job isn't to enforce laws but to provide service. Reporting someone for a minor offense because they didn't tip could be seen as an asshole move. Also, the driver loses money on the delivery, so maybe they should adjust their approach, like asking for tips or not taking the delivery, but not involving the police. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're misusing the legal system for personal financial gain rather than addressing the issue appropriately, like discussing with the employer or finding another way to handle non-tipping customers.\n"
