Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The main points are the customer hasn't tipped multiple times, is stoned, and the driver loses money on each delivery. \n\nFirst, I need to check the laws in their area. If weed is illegal, then using it is a crime. The driver isn't the police, so reporting a crime isn't necessarily wrong. But maybe they should consider other factors.\n\nThe customer writes $0.00 in the tip, so it's intentional, not just forgetting. The driver relies on tips for income, which is a valid concern. But is the main issue the non-tipping or the potential illegal activity? \n\nHowever, the driver's job isn't to enforce the law, but they are allowed to report crimes. The question is about whether they're an asshole for doing so. If the customer is using illegal substances, reporting them could be justified. But maybe there's a middle ground, like talking to the manager first? \n\nBut the user is in a position where they can report the customer without overstepping. It's possible the customer's actions are illegal, and the driver has a right to report that. However, some might see it as using the law to get revenge for not tipping, which could make them the asshole. \n\nBut if the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, then using the law might be seen as disproportionate. But if they genuinely believe the customer is committing a crime, then it's their right to report. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the activity is illegal. But if the driver's primary motivation is the tips, then maybe A. However, the law takes precedence. So the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting a potential crime, even if the motivation is the tips. The key is the legality of the customer's actions.\n"
