Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is a delivery driver who's been delivering to a customer multiple times. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and during those deliveries, the customer was stoned and smelled of weed. The driver isn't against smoking per se but points out that it's illegal where they live. The main issue is whether reporting the customer to the police would make the driver an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If marijuana is indeed illegal in that area, then using it is a crime. However, just smelling like weed or being high doesn't necessarily constitute a crime unless there's proof of possession or use. The driver might not have the authority to report someone just because they smell like weed. Unless the driver has evidence of active use, which they don't, reporting them might be a stretch. But the customer is clearly not tipping, which is a separate issue.\n\nThe driver is underpaid, making $5 an hour and relying on tips. The customer's zero tips are affecting their income. But does that justify using the illegal activity as a reason to report them? The driver's motivation might be more about the lack of tips than the weed. That could be a problem because it's using a legal issue as a lever for a personal grievance. But is it morally wrong? If the customer is breaking the law, the driver might feel justified in reporting them, even if the real issue is the tips.\n\nOn the other hand, if the driver is primarily angry about not receiving tips and using the weed as an excuse, that could be seen as opportunistic. It's possible that the driver is overstepping by involving the police for a civil matter (non-payment of tips) which is not a criminal offense. Tips are a customary practice, not a legal requirement for customers. So the customer not tipping isn't illegal, but using that as a reason to report a potential drug use is crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the driver might not have a valid way to prove the customer was using weed. Just smelling like it isn't enough. The police might not take the report seriously without evidence. The driver could end up wasting police resources. That could make the report seem like a false report, which is illegal and unethical.\n\nIn terms of morality, the question is whether the driver's intentions matter. If the main goal is revenge for not getting tips, then the report is malicious. But if the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, even if the tips are a secondary factor, it's a different scenario. However, the way the question is phrased, the driver is focusing more on the tips and the loss of money each time, which might indicate that the primary motive is financial.\n\nSo, the answer likely hinges on whether the driver is justified in reporting for a legal violation. Since there's no concrete evidence and the motivation is primarily financial, the driver is probably in the wrong. Reporting would be an overreach, using a possible legal issue as a pretext for a personal grievance. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
