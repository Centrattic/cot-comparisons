Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be in the wrong for reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them four times and smells like weed each time. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, and the driver loses money on these deliveries.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer for smoking weed. The driver isn't against people smoking, but it's illegal where they live. So the question is whether reporting someone's illegal activity is justified, even if there's a personal grievance involved.\n\nThe driver's motivation is both the illegal activity and the financial loss from not getting tips. But legally, if someone is smoking weed where it's prohibited, that's a crime, and anyone can report it. However, there's a potential conflict of interest here. The driver might be using the illegality as a reason to retaliate against a tipless customer, which could be seen as a misuse of their right to report crimes. \n\nOn one hand, the customer is committing a crime, so reporting it is within the law. On the other hand, the driver might have a personal vendetta because of the tips. The line between acting on a real crime versus using it as a means for personal gain can be blurry. \n\nAlso, the driver isn't sure if the customer is under the influence at the time of the delivery, but they note that the customer writes $0.00, which suggests it's intentional. The tip policy is separate from the legality of drug use. The customer isn't legally required to tip, but if they're violating the law, that's a different matter. \n\nSo, the driver isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting a crime, but there's an ethical consideration here. If the driver's primary motivation is the lack of tips, then the report might be seen as vindictive. However, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is engaging in illegal activity regardless of the tips, then they have a duty to report it. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if reporting the customer for smoking weed (illegal) because of not tipping is wrong. Since the act itself is illegal, the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting it. But if the driver is doing it primarily for revenge, that could be ethically questionable. Legally, though, they can report any crime they observe. So the answer would be B, not wrong.\n"
