Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who consistently doesn't tip and is smoking weed when they receive the delivery. The person in question is a repeat offender, not tipping four times and the driver is losing money due to the distance. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: If weed is illegal where they live, the driver is reporting a potential legal violation. But the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips. So the driver is using the weed as an excuse to report someone they feel is unfair to them financially. But wait, is the driver allowed to report someone just because they're using an illegal substance? Legally, maybe, but ethically, it's questionable. The driver might be taking advantage of the situation to get some form of retribution for not being tipped.\n\nOn the other hand, the driver isn't justifying the report based on the weed but also the intentional $0 tips. However, the act of reporting someone for a crime they've committed (if indeed it's illegal) isn't inherently wrong. But the driver's primary motivation is financial gain, not upholding the law. That could make it morally wrong. Also, maybe the driver isn't certain if the customer is actually violating the law. They smell weed, but maybe it's legal in some form, or the customer has a permit. The driver's assumption might be incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: The driver is in a service job and might feel entitled to tips, but tipping is a social custom, not a legal requirement. So expecting a tip isn't a legal matter. Reporting someone for not tipping isn't a crime. The driver is conflating two issues: the customer's possible illegal activity and their own financial loss from the tips. If the driver reports the customer, the police might not act on the tip issue, but the weed could be a valid reason. However, the driver could be using the weed as a pretext to get the customer in trouble.\n\nAlso, the driver is losing money on the delivery, which might be a business decision to avoid that route if possible. But they choose to report instead. So the ethical dilemma is about using a legal issue to address a personal financial grievance. The answer hinges on whether the driver's primary motive is to enforce the law or to retaliate for not getting tips. If it's the latter, then they're in the wrong. If it's the former, they might not be. But since the driver mentions both the lack of tips and the weed, the main justification is the weed, but the main motivation is the tips. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong (A).\n"
