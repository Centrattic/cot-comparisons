Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is clearly under the influence of weed. The user says the customer writes $0.00 each time, which means they intentionally don't tip. The driver mentions that they lose money on these deliveries because the customer is far away, and they rely on tips as part of their income since they're paid $5 an hour. The user is conflicted but wonders if reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area, is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether using the customer's illegal activity (smoking weed) as a reason to report them is appropriate. The key points here are the legality of weed in their location, the customer's actions regarding tipping, and the driver's intent in reporting. \n\nIf weed is indeed illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law. However, the driver's primary job is to deliver pizza, not to act as a law enforcer. The driver's grievance is about not receiving tips, which is a separate issue. The driver might be tempted to report the customer as a form of retaliation for not tipping, which complicates things. Even though the customer is breaking the law, using that as a pretext to report them for not tipping could be seen as misuse of authority or overstepping. \n\nThe user mentions they don't have a problem with weed in general but are against the illegality. The customer's non-tipping is intentional, which is frustrating, but the driver's hourly wage is low, relying on tips. However, the decision to report someone for a crime should be based on actual illegal activity, not as a response to a personal grievance. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report the customer solely because of the weed use, which is illegal, then technically the customer is breaking the law. But if the report is a retaliation for not tipping, that's a different matter. The line between reporting a crime and using it as a weapon for a personal issue is thin here. The driver's motivation is crucial. If the report is genuine to report an illegal act, then maybe not wrong. But if it's a way to get back for not tipping, then yes, it's wrong. The question is whether the driver is justified in using the illegal activity as a reason when their real issue is the tips. \n\nIn most places, it's against the law to use someone's illegal activity as a means to retaliate. The police might not take the report seriously if it's perceived as a tip-related complaint. The driver could face consequences for making false reports or using illegal information against the customer. Also, the customer's non-tipping is a customer service issue, not a legal one. \n\nTherefore, the answer would depend on the intent. Since the driver's main grievance is the tips, using the weed as an excuse to report might be seen as misusing the legal system. So the author is in the wrong because they're using the illegal activity as a tool to address their personal financial issue, which is not appropriate.\n"
