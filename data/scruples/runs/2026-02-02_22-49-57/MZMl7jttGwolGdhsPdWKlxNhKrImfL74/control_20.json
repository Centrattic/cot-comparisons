Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who didn't tip and was smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is smoking weed, that's a crime. The driver is thinking of reporting them. Legally, if someone sees a crime being committed, they have a duty to report it, right? But sometimes people hesitate because they don't want to be snitches. But in this case, the driver isn't just seeing someone smoke weed once; it's multiple times. The customer smells strongly of weed each time they deliver.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and it's a far delivery, so the driver loses money each time. The driver relies on tips for income, making $5/hr base. The customer intentionally sets tip to $0, not just forgetting. That's a problem for the driver. But is it the driver's responsibility to report the customer for not tipping? Probably not. But the weed part is a legal matter.\n\nBut wait, the driver is a private individual. If they report the customer, they could be seen as a snitch, but if they're not the ones using or selling, maybe they have a right to report a crime. However, the driver might also be motivated by the lack of tips. Is there a conflict of interest here? Maybe, but legally, they can report if they believe a crime is occurring. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the driver is using the legal system for personal gain. But if the customer is indeed committing a crime (illegal drug use), then reporting it isn't necessarily wrong. The driver isn't making a false report; they have a reasonable belief based on the smell and the situation.\n\nSo the key factors are: legality of weed in the area, the customer's actions (smoking weed illegally), and the driver's intent. While the driver is upset about the lack of tips, the act of reporting a potential crime isn't wrong. However, the driver might be seen as taking advantage of the situation for personal reasons, but legally, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
