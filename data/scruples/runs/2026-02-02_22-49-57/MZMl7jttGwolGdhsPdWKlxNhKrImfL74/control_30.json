Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips multiple times from a customer. The customer smells like weed and appears to be stoned. The driver is considering reporting them for smoking weed because it's illegal where they live. The driver mentions that they make $5 an hour and rely on tips. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their area, then using it is against the law. However, the driver is not a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone to the police for a crime they witness is generally allowed, but it's important to consider the context. The driver might be motivated by financial reasons rather than just public safety. \n\nThe customer is not tipping, which affects the driver's income. The driver is wondering if reporting them would be an asshole move. The user is asking if they're in the wrong if they report this person. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that using personal financial grievances as a reason to report someone for a crime is inappropriate. But others might say that if the customer is indeed violating the law (assuming weed is illegal there), the driver has a duty to report crimes they observe, regardless of personal feelings. However, there's also the aspect of privacy and whether the driver can even prove that the customer is using weed. The driver's evidence is based on smell and observation, which might not be sufficient for a police investigation.\n\nAlso, the driver's motivation is a key point. If they're doing it for revenge over not getting tips, that could be seen as vindictive. But if they genuinely believe a crime is happening, they're within their rights to report it. However, making a report for personal gain could be unethical. \n\nThe situation is complex. Legally, reporting a crime is allowed, but ethically, if the primary motive is financial, it might be questionable. The outcome might depend on the specific laws in the area regarding weed and police procedures for such reports. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. If the author is in the wrong, it would be because their intentions are primarily financial. If they're not, then it's their right to report a crime. Given the information, leaning towards answer B (not in the wrong) but with a note about the ethical considerations.\n"
