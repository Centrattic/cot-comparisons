Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be smoking weed. The key points here are the legal status of weed where they live, the customer's behavior (not tipping, being high), and the financial impact because the delivery is a long one.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that smoking weed is illegal in their area. If the customer is using it, that's a legal violation. The author is considering reporting this, which is their right as a citizen. However, the main issue here is the lack of tipping. The author relies on tips for income, and the customer intentionally not tipping (writing $0.00) is a separate issue. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by reporting the customer. Legally, if the customer is breaking the law by using an illegal substance, the author isn't wrong for reporting that. But the motivation here might be a factor. The author's primary motive is the lack of tips, and using the weed as a reason could be seen as using a legal issue to get revenge or compensation for the tips. However, legally, they can report the illegal activity regardless of their personal grievances. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer's actions (not tipping) are a civil matter, not a criminal one. The author can't force the customer to tip, so reporting for that isn't appropriate. But since the customer is also possibly violating the law (if being high in a public place or visible consumption is illegal), the author is within their rights to report that. \n\nThe ethical angle is trickier. If the author is mainly upset about the tips but uses the weed as an excuse, others might see it as vindictive. But legally, they're not wrong for reporting a potential law violation. However, if the police don't have probable cause, the report might not hold up, leading to the author being seen as an informer for the wrong reasons. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report the customer solely for the weed use which is a legal issue, then they're not in the wrong. But if their main motive is the tips, that could be problematic. The question is whether the act of reporting is justified by the legal violation. Since weed use is illegal where they live, the author is not in the wrong for reporting that, even if they have personal grievances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
