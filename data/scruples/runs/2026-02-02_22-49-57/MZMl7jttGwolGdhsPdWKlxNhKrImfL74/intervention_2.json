Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't been tipped by a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed and the driver thinks it's illegal there. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed because they don't tip, and the customer intentionally puts $0.00. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer solely because they aren't tipping. The driver mentions that the customer's actions (smoking weed) are illegal, so maybe they're using that as a reason to report them. But is that a valid reason? The customer's choice to not tip isn't a crime, but if the driver observes illegal activity, they might report it. However, the underlying motive is the lack of tips. \n\nSo, the question is: is the driver in the wrong for using the weed-smelling customer as a pretext to report them for not tipping? Because the driver is using a legal issue to get tips, which could be seen as manipulative. On the other hand, if the customer is actually violating the law, the driver has a responsibility to report it. But the problem is the driver's primary motivation is the tips, not the illegal activity. \n\nAlso, the customer is one of the farthest deliveries, leading to a loss for the driver. That might add to the driver's frustration, but doesn't justify reporting them. There's a conflict between the driver's need for tips and the customer's possible illegal activity. The driver might be in a tight spot, but reporting someone for a crime just because they're a bad tipper could be considered an asshole move if the driver's main intent is to retaliate for not tipping. Unless the driver is genuinely concerned about the illegal activity regardless of the tips. \n\nBut the way the situation is presented, the driver is linking the two, so it's possible they're using the weed as an excuse. However, the law is the law. If the customer is smoking weed in a place where it's illegal, then the driver is within their rights to report that. But the driver might be overstepping if they're doing it just to get tips. \n\nSo it's a bit of a dilemma. The driver is in a bad position because their income depends on tips, and the customer is taking advantage. But using the law to retaliate could be seen as wrong. The answer likely depends on the driver's intent. If they truly believe the customer is breaking the law and report them regardless of the tips, it's not their fault. But if they're using it as a way to get money back, they might be crossing a line. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is considering reporting the customer for a potential legal violation, but the motivation is the lack of tips, I think the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because using a legal issue as a tool for personal gain might be unethical. However, if the driver is genuinely following the law, then B (No). But the context suggests the driver is more upset about the tips, so A.\n"
