Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be under the influence of weed. The key points here are:\n\n1. **Tipping**: The customer deliberately leaves $0.00 in tips, which affects the driver's income. The driver makes $5/hour and relies on tips, so losing tips from a customer who's far (costing them money per delivery) is a significant issue.\n\n2. **Smoking Weed**: The customer is visibly high and smells like weed. The driver mentions it's illegal where they live, so there's a potential legal issue here. However, the driver isn't sure if they should report this.\n\n3. **Motive**: The driver's main grievance seems to be the lack of tips. They're considering reporting the customer because they smell weed, but the underlying issue is the unpaid tips and financial loss.\n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. \n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver has a right to report that. However, the driver's primary motive might be the lack of tips. There's a conflict here between the driver's right to report illegal activity and their possible self-interest in relation to tips. \n\nIn some places, citizens can report illegal activities, so the act of reporting per se isn't wrong. But if the driver is using the weed as an excuse to retaliate against the customer for not tipping, that could be seen as inconsiderate or an overreaction. The line between legal action and personal vendetta is thin here.\n\nAlso, the customer's choice to consume weed, while illegal, doesn't directly impact the driver's job except for the tipping issue. The driver's job is to deliver, and the customer's use of weed isn't interfering with the service quality (order is correct, on time). So the driver might be conflating two separate issues: unpaid tips and the customer's personal behavior.\n\nIn terms of ethics, using the customer's illegal activity as a reason to report them when the main issue is unpaid tips could be seen as hypocritical or self-serving. The driver might be using the weed as a justification for their own frustration over not getting tips. \n\nTherefore, while the act of reporting isn't inherently wrong if there's a genuine concern about illegal activity, the driver's primary motivation (unpaid tips) might make them the one in the wrong for using that as a reason to involve the police. It's about intent here. If the driver's intent is to address the illegal substance use, then they're acting responsibly. But if they're using the weed as a pretext for not receiving tips, they could be seen as an asshole.\n"
