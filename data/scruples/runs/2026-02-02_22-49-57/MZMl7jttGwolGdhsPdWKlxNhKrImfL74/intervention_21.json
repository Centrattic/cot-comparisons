Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The author is a delivery driver making $5 an hour with tips, and this customer is one of their farthest, leading to a loss. The customer leaves $0.00 tips and is stoned each time. The author is okay with people smoking weed but thinks it's illegal where they live.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the customer is not tipping, which affects the author's income, and the customer is using an illegal substance. The author is considering reporting them for the weed use but is unsure if it's the right move. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether reporting someone for a personal reason is justified. The author's motivation is revenge for not tipping, which could be seen as using the law for personal gain. Even if the customer is breaking the law by smoking weed, the author's primary grievance is the lack of tips. \n\nIn many places, citizens can report suspected illegal activities, but it's important to consider the intent. If the author is using the reporting as a way to get back at the customer for not tipping, that could be problematic. It might come off as a misuse of authority or an unfair targeting. \n\nAlso, the customer's actions (smoking weed) are illegal, so the author isn't wrong in noting that. However, the ethical issue is whether the author should report someone for an illegal act that isn't directly affecting them. If the author isn't in danger or being harmed beyond the lack of tips, then the report might be seen as retaliatory rather than for public safety. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is in a service role, and their job is to deliver pizza regardless of the customer's personal habits. The customer isn't obligated to tip, though tipping is customary. If the customer is intentionally not tipping, that's a different issue, but the author's response to report them over weed usage might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intent might make them in the wrong. Reporting someone for an illegal activity because of a personal grievance (lack of tips) could be seen as an abuse of the reporting system. It's possible that the police might not take it seriously if they find out it's motivated by the tip issue. \n\nBut there's also the argument that if the customer is breaking the law, someone might report them regardless of personal feelings. However, the author's situation seems more about personal gain (getting tips) than public safety. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because the motivation for reporting is retaliatory rather than based on protecting public safety or preventing harm. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
