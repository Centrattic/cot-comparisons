Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the pizza delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed, especially since the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and the driver feels they're losing money on the delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver is not okay with that because it's against the law. But at the same time, the customer is not tipping, which is affecting the driver's income since they make minimum wage and depend on tips. The driver is wondering if they're an asshole for reporting this customer.\n\nSo, the main points here are the legality of weed in the customer's location and the driver's motivation. If weed is illegal, then the customer is breaking the law. But the driver's primary job is to deliver the pizza, not to police customers. The issue is whether the driver has a responsibility to report someone just because they're not tipping. \n\nThe user is asking if the driver is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the customer is indeed violating the law by smoking weed, then reporting them isn't a crime. However, the driver's intent here is partly about the lack of tips. So there's a mix of personal financial motivation and legal enforcement. \n\nBut wait, the driver might be overstepping their role. Their job is to deliver food, not to report customers for their personal activities unless it's something that endangers the driver or others. Even if the customer is high, as long as they're not causing harm, it's their own choice. The driver's responsibility is to follow the law, but maybe not to act as a snitch for personal gain. \n\nAlso, the customer is writing $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional, not a mistake. The driver is losing money on the delivery because the customer is not tipping. That's a legitimate concern for the driver's income. But is it right to report someone for not tipping, using the weed smell as a reason? That seems like a stretch. \n\nIn many places, even if weed is illegal, it's up to the police to enforce. The driver isn't a law enforcement officer, so maybe they're not in the wrong for reporting a possible crime. But their primary motive is the tips, which could make it more of a personal grievance rather than a public safety issue. \n\nSo, the question is whether the driver's intent to report the customer for a non-violent, personal legal issue (smoking weed) to get a tip is justified. Legally, the customer is breaking the law, but socially, it's a gray area. The driver might not be in the wrong for reporting the illegal activity, but their motive could be seen as using the law to settle a personal score over money. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is clearly violating the law, the driver might be right to report them. But if the driver is using the weed smell as an excuse to avoid the long delivery and get a tip, that's not a valid reason. The answer hinges on the legality of the action versus the driver's personal motive. \n\nSince the user is asking if the driver is in the wrong, and given that the customer is intentionally not tipping, the driver's action is partly about their own financial interest, which might be seen as using the law for personal gain. Therefore, the driver might be in the wrong because their primary job isn't to enforce laws against personal conduct, unless there's a direct threat.\n"
