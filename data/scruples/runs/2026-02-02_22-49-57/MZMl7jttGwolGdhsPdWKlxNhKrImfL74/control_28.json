Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is using weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, the main points here are the lack of tipping and the customer smoking weed. The author mentions that the person has ordered pizza four times, didn't tip each time, and smelled like weed. They also note that delivering to this customer is a far distance, leading to a loss of money per delivery. The author's income is based on tips, so this customer is affecting their earnings.\n\nNow, legal vs. personal ethics. The customer's weed use is illegal locally, so reporting that is a legal concern. But the author's main grievance is the lack of tips. Tipping is a social norm, not a legal requirement. So the author's motivation for reporting might be more about the tips than the weed use. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for using the weed as an excuse to report someone over tips? Well, if they're using the legal issue as a way to get revenge for not tipping, that could be seen as unethical. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, they might be right to report. However, the key point is the author's intent. If they're primarily upset about the tips and using the weed as a justification, that's where the moral issue lies. \n\nAlso, considering the customer's right to privacy. Just because someone smells like weed doesn't necessarily mean they're using it illegally. Maybe they have a medical exemption or it's a different substance. The author might be making an assumption. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot because they need the tips. But using the law to retaliate for not getting tips could be seen as wrong, especially if the customer's actions aren't solely illegal. Also, the author's main issue is financial loss from tips, not the weed itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) if the author is within their legal right to report illegal activity. But if they're using the weed as a pretext for the tips, then A (in the wrong). The line here is blurry. Since weed use is illegal, the author isn't necessarily wrong to report. But if they're doing it out of spite for tips, that's a different matter. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they have a legitimate reason (illegal activity), then B. If it's just revenge, A. The post says the author is considering reporting because of both factors, but the tip issue is the main driver. So the author's intent is more about the tips, making them in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
