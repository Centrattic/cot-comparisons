Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is known to be smoking weed when the deliveries happen, which is illegal in their area. The driver is considering reporting the customer to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal there, then using it is a crime. However, the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not to enforce the law. The driver isn't in a position to police others, so reporting someone for personal reasons might be crossing a line. But maybe there's a public safety aspect if the customer is under the influence while driving or in public. The question is whether the driver has a valid reason to report them just for using weed in their own home.\n\nThen, the financial aspect: the customer isn't tipping, which affects the driver's income. But not tipping is a different issue. The driver can't force someone to tip. The customer might be choosing not to tip for various reasons, even if they're not high. The fact that the customer writes $0.00 suggests they intentionally don't tip, which is within their rights. \n\nMoral implications: The driver is using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them, possibly out of spite over not getting tips. That could be seen as vindictive. Also, the driver might be losing money on these deliveries, but that's a business consideration. It's not the customer's fault they're a far delivery. \n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? Reporting someone for a personal grievance (lack of tips) and a legal issue (weed use) might be misuse of authority. The driver isn't a law enforcement officer and shouldn't act as one. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is wrong) because they're using a legal issue to retaliate for not getting tips. But if weed use is indeed illegal and the driver is reporting based on that, maybe it's not wrong. However, the main motive here seems to be revenge for not getting tips, which complicates things. The line between legitimate reporting and personal vendetta is key here.\n"
