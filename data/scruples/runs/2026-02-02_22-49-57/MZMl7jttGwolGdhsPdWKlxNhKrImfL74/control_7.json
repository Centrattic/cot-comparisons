Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly smoking weed when they receive deliveries. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's consistent failure to tip, and the financial impact on the driver.\n\nFirst, the driver is concerned about the customer smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. So, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver might think reporting is justified. But wait, the customer's actions are private unless there's something illegal happening during the delivery. The driver can't see inside the customer's house, only that they smell like weed after delivering. The driver isn't a police officer, so they can't just report someone based on a smell unless they have evidence of illegal activity happening in public or in their presence.\n\nAlso, the tipping issue. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip, which the driver sees as intentional. The driver relies on tips for income and loses money on each delivery to this customer. But is it the driver's place to report someone for not tipping? That's a separate issue from illegal activity. The driver might feel wronged, but the customer isn't breaking the law by not tipping. Tipping is a social norm, not a legal requirement, unless there's a specific local law requiring it, which I don't think is common.\n\nSo combining both issues: reporting someone for not tipping and for possibly using an illegal substance. The driver isn't in a position to enforce laws they witness indirectly. They can't just report someone based on a smell unless there's a direct violation in their presence. Plus, using the law as leverage for unpaid tips could be seen as retaliatory or a way to get money, which might not be ethical.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is using weed in a way that's illegal, the driver might believe they have a duty to report it. However, the driver's own role is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. There's a line between being a concerned citizen and overstepping one's role. The driver might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's questionable because the main motive might be about the tips rather than the weed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using the illegal activity as a reason to retaliate for not receiving tips, which could be seen as exploiting a situation for personal gain rather than a genuine public safety concern.\n"
