Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for reporting a customer to the police because that customer smokes weed multiple times. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and the user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area, and they write $0.00 as a tip. The driver is in a job where tips are crucial, especially since they make $5 an hour. The customer is also one of their farthest deliveries, meaning the driver loses money each time.\n\nThe question is whether the driver is in the wrong by considering reporting the customer. Let's look at the legality first. If weed is illegal, then using it is against the law. Reporting someone for illegal activity isn't necessarily wrong. However, the driver's motivation here might be more about the lack of tips than the weed itself. They mention that the customer writes $0.00, not forgetting to tip. So, the driver might be using the weed as a reason to report them, but their real issue is the lack of tips.\n\nNow, is the driver overstepping? If they report someone just for smoking weed, which they might not be aware of unless they entered the premises, then maybe. But if they can observe it through smell or other means, they might think they have grounds. However, the primary motive being financial gain could make this ethically questionable. The driver is relying on tips, so there's a conflict of interest here. Reporting someone for a minor illegal activity to get paid might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the customer's choice to use weed might be their own, and the driver's job is to deliver pizza. They might not be the ones to enforce the law. It's possible that the police would not prioritize this unless there's a clear violation. Plus, the driver is using this as a reason to get tips, which could be seen as exploiting the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is using illegal substances, it's their right to do so in their own home, unless there's a specific law against it. The driver might not have the authority to report someone for something they can observe but isn't a direct threat to others. The real issue here is the lack of tips, but the driver is using the weed as a pretext. That could be seen as wrong because it's using someone's personal choices against them for personal gain.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because they're using the illegal activity as a justification to get tips, which is unethical. Their main issue is the tips, not the weed, and reporting someone for that reason is exploiting their personal choices. Plus, the driver's job is to deliver food, not to enforce laws. They should probably address the tipping issue through other means, like the company or customer service, instead of involving the police.\n"
