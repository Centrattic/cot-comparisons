Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer never tips and is always high on weed. The key points here are that the customer hasn't tipped multiple times, they\u2019re smoking weed, which is illegal in their area, and the driver is losing money on those deliveries. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. If weed is illegal where they are, then the customer could be breaking the law by using it. However, the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. Reporting someone for a drug-related offense could be seen as vigilantism unless there's an immediate threat or illegal activity happening in the driver's presence. The customer is just smoking weed in their own home, so the driver's presence during that activity is probably just incidental. \n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer intentionally leaves $0.00, which is within their right to do. The driver is upset about not getting tips, especially since it affects their income. But is that a reason to report someone for drug use? The driver might feel wronged by the lack of tips, but the act of not tipping is a separate issue from drug use. \n\nEthically, the driver is in a tough spot. They need the tips to make a living, but using the drug use as a reason to report someone might be crossing a line. The driver might be conflating two issues\u2014low tips and drug use\u2014into one. The customer's drug use doesn't affect the service provided, so reporting them for that reason could be seen as using the situation to get revenge for not receiving tips. \n\nAlso, the driver might not have a duty to report unless they suspect illegal activity that's ongoing and harmful. Since the customer is in their home, the driver isn't witnessing a crime in real-time. It's possible the customer is using weed legally (if it's decriminalized in some way) or the driver isn't in a position to enforce the law. \n\nIn terms of morality, is the driver right to report? If the driver's main motivation is the lack of tips, then it's not about public safety but personal gain. That could make the driver an asshole, as the question implies. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the driver is using a legal issue to retaliate for not getting paid fairly, which is a different matter.\n"
