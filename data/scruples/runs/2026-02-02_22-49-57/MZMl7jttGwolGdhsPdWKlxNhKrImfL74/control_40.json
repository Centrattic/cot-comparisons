Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The main points here are about the legality of the situation and the ethics of the driver's actions.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping, which is affecting the driver's income. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. That's a real concern because in some places, tipped wages are lower, but this might be different. The customer has left $0.00 tips four times, so it's not a one-time thing.\n\nThen there's the weed. The driver mentions the customer smells like weed each time, and it's illegal where they live. The driver isn't necessarily in favor of drug use but respects personal choice. However, since it's illegal, maybe that's a reason to report. But wait, the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce the law. The customer is inside their own home, so unless there's a violation like public use or selling, the driver can't really know for sure. The police might need more evidence than just a smell.\n\nAlso, the driver is considering reporting for not tipping. But isn't that a separate issue? The driver could escalate the matter with their employer or the customer directly, but involving the police over a $0 tip for weed use? That might not be the right approach. The customer's drug use is their own business unless it's a crime being committed (like selling), which the driver can't verify.\n\nSo, the driver is frustrated because they lose money on each delivery, but reporting for not tipping isn't a legal issue. The weed part is tricky. If the customer is using illegally, maybe the driver can report that, but they need to be sure. However, the driver's motivation is partly about the tips, which complicates things. The police might see this as a personal grudge. Plus, there's the privacy aspect of someone's drug use in their home. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the driver is using the police to address a financial loss from a customer's personal choice, which might be seen as hypocritical. The driver isn't in the wrong legally if they report an illegal activity, but ethically, it's questionable because their main grievance is about tips, not the drug use itself. \n\nSo, the answer is B because the driver isn't necessarily wrong legally, but ethically it's a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the person is reporting for a legitimate reason (illegal weed use), they might not be in the wrong. But if it's just about the tips, then they are in the wrong. The driver's main issue seems to be the lack of tips, using weed as a reason to report. That would make them in the wrong. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, they might not be. The line is blurry here. \n\nWait, the user says the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. If the customer is using it in their home, that's a civil offense, not a criminal one in some places. The police might not act on that unless there's a public issue. So reporting for that might be overstepping. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong because they're using a civil issue to address a personal complaint about tips. So the answer would be A. Hmm, conflicting thoughts. Need to check the legal perspective again. If it's illegal and the driver has probable cause, they can report. But without more, it's just a smell. The driver's main motive is the tips, which is not a valid reason. So the answer is A.\n"
