Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a delivery driver who hasn't received tips multiple times from a customer. The customer is often stoned and smells like weed. The author is considering reporting him because they think it's illegal where they live. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not a mistake. The author relies on tips since they make $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of marijuana in their location. If it's illegal, then using or smoking it could be a crime. However, if the customer is using it legally (if marijuana is legal in their area), then the author might be overstepping. The question says the user should assume the situation as described, so the author states it's illegal there. So, technically, the customer is breaking the law if they're smoking weed. But the author's role is to deliver food, not enforce the law. \n\nNext, the main issue is the tipping. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the author's income. The author is frustrated because they lose money on each delivery due to the distance. But is reporting the customer for drug use a justified response? Even if it's illegal, the author's primary job is to deliver the pizza. Reporting someone for personal drug use, even if it's illegal, might be seen as a form of entrapment or using a personal grievance to involve the police. \n\nThere's a difference between reporting someone for a crime and using a personal inconvenience as a reason. The author is upset about the lack of tips, but the customer's actions (smelling like weed) might not be a crime unless they're actively using it in a public place where it's prohibited. Even if it's illegal, the author might not be in the right to report someone just because they didn't tip. It could be considered a conflict of interest or using their position to enforce personal rules. \n\nAdditionally, the customer is aware of the tip section and intentionally sets it to zero. That's on them, but it doesn't justify the author reporting them for a separate issue. The author could consider other options, like adjusting their route or discussing with their employer about compensation for far deliveries. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering the report. \n\nIn some places, citizens can report illegal activities without being the victim, but using that as a means to retaliate for not receiving tips might be seen as malicious. The author's motivation is financial gain, not public safety or preventing harm. So, even though the customer is breaking the law (if weed is illegal), the author's intent might make their action unethical. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're using a personal grievance (lack of tips) as a reason to report someone for an activity that might not directly impact others and is possibly a private matter. The author should address the tipping issue through appropriate channels, like discussing with their employer, rather than involving law enforcement for a personal issue.\n"
