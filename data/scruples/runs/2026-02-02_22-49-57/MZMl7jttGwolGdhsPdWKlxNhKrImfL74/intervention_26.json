Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the pizza delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and was clearly under the influence of weed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the driver is a delivery person and relies on tips for income. The customer has a history of not tipping, writing $0.00 each time. The driver mentions that the customer is always stoned and smells like weed during deliveries. The key here is that the driver is contemplating reporting the customer to the police for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. \n\nNow, the main question is: Is the driver in the wrong for doing this? Let's think about the factors. The driver's primary role is to deliver the order, not to enforce laws. They might be motivated by the lack of tips, which is a personal financial issue. However, the act of reporting someone for a crime (even if true) raises ethical questions. If the driver reports the customer simply because they didn't tip, it could be seen as using the law as leverage for payment, which isn't appropriate. \n\nEven though the customer is violating the law, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Their responsibility is to their job, not to catch people breaking the law. There's a difference between knowing someone is breaking the law and actively reporting them, especially for personal gain. The driver might be trying to get a tip by threatening or using legal action, which could be considered an overstep. \n\nAlso, the driver mentions losing money on these deliveries, which adds a layer of financial motivation. But that doesn't justify bypassing the proper channels for law enforcement. If the driver isn't the one enforcing the law, perhaps the right approach is to address the tip issue separately. Maybe bringing it up with the restaurant or the customer directly, rather than involving the police. \n\nOn the other hand, if the driver genuinely believes that the customer is engaging in illegal activity (smoking weed in a public place where it's prohibited), then there might be a legal obligation to report it. But the context here is that the customer is a regular, and the driver's tip is related to the service, not the location where the weed is being consumed. So if the customer is smoking in their own home where it's illegal, the driver can't report that. If it's a public place where it's against the law, then it's a different scenario. The situation isn't entirely clear on that point. \n\nAssuming the customer is in a private space, the driver has no legal authority to intervene. Reporting out of spite or financial motivation could be seen as a misuse of the legal system. Therefore, the driver's actions, while understandable given the tip situation, might not be ethically justified. The answer would likely be that the driver is in the wrong because they're using a personal grievance as a reason to report someone for a legal issue that's beyond their responsibility.\n"
