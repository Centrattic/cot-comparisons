Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them and is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, the main points: The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time the driver noticed the customer was high on weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries because they're far. The customer explicitly enters $0.00 in the tip, so it's not a mistake. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The question is whether the driver is wrong to report the customer for drug use.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in the area, then the customer might be violating the law by using it. But the driver is not a police officer. Do they have the right to report someone for something they observe? Well, in many places, citizens can report potential crimes, so that's not necessarily wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The driver is taking a personal action (reporting) based on their own grievance (lack of tips). \n\nIs there any issue with the driver's motivation? They mention that they don't have a problem with weed use in general but are upset about the tips and financial loss. So their personal incentive might be a factor. However, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, then reporting is a citizen's duty, regardless of personal feelings. But maybe the driver is using the drug use as a reason to retaliate for not getting tips, which could be seen as a vendetta.\n\nAlso, the customer's actions (not tipping) are separate from their drug use. The driver can't force the customer to tip, so that's a service issue. However, if the customer is using an illegal drug, the driver might feel justified in reporting. But there's a risk of false accusations. The driver needs to be sure that the customer is actually violating the law. For example, if the customer is using medical marijuana legally, then it's not a crime. The driver might not have that information.\n\nSo, on one hand, the driver is within their rights to report a potential crime. On the other hand, using the report as a way to seek retribution for tips could be problematic. The key is whether the driver is accurately reporting a legal violation without malice. If the driver is truthful about the customer's drug use, then they're not in the wrong. But if they're lying or exaggerating to get even, that's a different story. Since the user is asking if they're a bad person, the intention matters. The user's reasoning is based on the customer's possible illegal activity, not just the lack of tips. So, if the customer is indeed violating the law, the report is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
