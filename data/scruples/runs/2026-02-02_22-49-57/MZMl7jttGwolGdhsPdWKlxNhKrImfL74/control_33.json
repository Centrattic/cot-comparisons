Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is often high on weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver feels they lose money on these deliveries because the customer is far away. They're considering reporting the customer for drug use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of marijuana in that location. If it's illegal, then using it is against the law, regardless of the context. The customer is intentionally not tipping by entering $0.00, so it's not a mistake. The driver's income relies heavily on tips, which makes this a financial issue for them.\n\nThe ethical question is whether reporting someone for drug use is justified in this scenario. On one hand, the driver is upholding the law. On the other, the driver might be using the customer's failure to tip as a reason to report them, which could be seen as using the law for personal gain. However, if the customer is openly violating the law by using an illegal substance, the driver might have a duty to report it, regardless of the tipping issue. \n\nBut there's a potential for misuse here. The driver might be taking advantage of the situation to target a customer who doesn't tip, using the drug use as an excuse. The line between enforcing the law and seeking retaliation can be blurry. However, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the driver isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting them. The key factor is the legality of the substance. If it's illegal, then the driver isn't wrong for reporting the customer's drug use, even if their motivation is partly financial. But if the substance is legal, then the driver is wrong. Since the user mentions it's illegal where they live, the answer would lean towards the driver not being in the wrong. However, using the police as a means to punish the customer for not tipping might be ethically questionable, even if the drug use is a valid reason.\n"
