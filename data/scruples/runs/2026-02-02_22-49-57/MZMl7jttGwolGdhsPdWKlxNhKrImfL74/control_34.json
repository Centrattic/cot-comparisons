Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be a bad person (WIBTA) for reporting a customer to the police because the customer didn't tip multiple times and was smoking weed. The key points here are about the legality of weed in their location, the customer's actions, and the driver's motivations.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If that's the case, then the customer using weed could be breaking the law. The user isn't just annoyed about the tip; they're citing the illegal activity. So, from a legal standpoint, reporting someone for using illegal substances might be justified, even if the person is a customer. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the customer not tipping. The user makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer didn't tip four times, each time when the driver noticed the smell of weed. The user is upset about losing money on far deliveries and being paid poorly. However, the main reason for reporting is the weed use, not the tips. The user is using the tips as context for why they're motivated to report. \n\nNow, considering the ethical side, is it right to report someone for something the user isn't directly witnessing? The driver smells weed and assumes the customer is using it. But maybe the smell isn't from use, or maybe the customer isn't using it in a way that's illegal (like if it's legal in some areas but not others). Wait, the user already stated that it's illegal where they live. So the driver has a legitimate concern about illegal activity. \n\nHowever, there's a risk of false reporting. If the customer is using it in their own home, even if it's illegal, the driver can't be sure. They can only report what they believe. But if the driver is certain (based on smell and behavior), maybe they have a case. \n\nThe user's main issue is the lack of tips, but they are using the illegal activity as the reason for reporting. So the question is whether the user is justified in using the illegal activity as leverage to get a tip. That's a bit of a gray area. They might be exploiting a legal violation to get what they want, which could be seen as unethical. But if the illegal activity is a genuine issue, then reporting is separate from the tip issue. \n\nAlso, the driver's job is to deliver food, not to police customers. They might be overstepping their role by reporting someone for something that's not their responsibility. However, if they believe they're witnessing a crime, they might feel obligated to report it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the user reports the customer solely because of the weed use, which is illegal, then they might not be in the wrong legally. But ethically, if they're using the threat of reporting to get a tip, that's manipulative. However, the user says they're reporting because it's illegal, not to get a tip. \n\nThe user's main argument is that they're reporting because it's against the law. If that's the case, then they could argue they're doing their duty. But if they're doing it out of spite for the tips, that's different. The user seems to frame it as a duty because it's illegal, but the context of financial loss might cloud their judgment. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the user's primary motivation is the illegal activity or the lack of tips. Since they mention the illegal act and the tips, but state that they're reporting for the illegal use, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The user might be overstepping their role as a delivery driver. But if the person is indeed breaking the law, the driver isn't wrong for reporting it. So the answer is B.\n"
