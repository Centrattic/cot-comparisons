Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The author is a pizza delivery driver. The customer has not tipped four times, and the author smells weed each time. The customer doesn't forget the tip; they explicitly put $0.00. The author loses money on each delivery because it's a far location and they make $5/hour relying on tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer might be doing something against the law. But the author's job is to deliver food, not to police customers. So reporting someone for smoking weed in their own home could be seen as overstepping. However, the author is a private individual, not a law enforcement officer. So maybe the author isn't legally obligated to report, but they have the right to do so.\n\nThen the moral aspect. The customer isn't tipping, which is a service industry issue. The author is in a service job, and tips are a significant part of their income. The customer is choosing not to tip, which is within their rights. But the author is considering reporting for non-payment of tips, which isn't a crime. However, if the customer is using illegal substances, that's a different matter. But again, the author isn't a cop. \n\nThere's also the question of whether the author is using the weed as an excuse to get revenge for not tipping. The scenario mentions that the author loses money on each delivery. Maybe the real issue is the lack of tips, and the weed is just an added reason. \n\nIn some places, non-payment of tips isn't a criminal matter but a civil issue. The driver could report it to the restaurant or the payment service, but police might not take it seriously. Reporting someone for a non-emergency like this could be seen as harassment. \n\nAlso, the author's intention matters. If they genuinely believe the customer is violating the law (illegal drug use), then they have a right to report it. But if it's more about getting tips, then it's a different story. The customer's weed use isn't affecting the delivery service directly, unless the customer is impaired and acting dangerously. \n\nSo the conflict here is between the author's right to report illegal activity and the customer's right to privacy and personal choice. The author is in a tough spot because their livelihood depends on tips, and they feel wronged. However, using weed as a reason to report someone might not be justified, especially if it's not affecting the delivery service. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's about intent and proportionality. If the author is genuinely concerned about illegal activity and reports it, maybe not. But if they're using it as a pretext to get even for tips, then they might be. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction's laws regarding reporting and the specific circumstances of the weed use. But generally, people might not support using personal grievances to report others for non-violent drug use, especially if it's not endangering others. So the author could be in the wrong if their motivation is primarily about the tips.\n"
