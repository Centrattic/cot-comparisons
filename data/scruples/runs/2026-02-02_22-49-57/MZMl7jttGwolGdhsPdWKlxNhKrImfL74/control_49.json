Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is consistently high on weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver is losing money on each delivery to this person because it's a far location. They're considering reporting the customer for smoking weed because they make $5 an hour and rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal where they live, then using it is against the law. The driver isn't just reporting someone for not tipping but for a potential illegal activity. However, is the driver justified in reporting someone solely based on the suspicion that they're smoking weed? The customer might be using it legally, maybe in a private setting where it's allowed, even if the driver's state has some restrictions. Wait, the user says it's illegal there, so that part is a legal violation.\n\nBut the driver's motivation here is about the tips and financial loss. That could be a conflict of interest. The driver is using the customer's possible illegal activity as a way to get them to tip. Is that ethical? They might be trying to enforce the law, but their primary reason is financial gain. That could be seen as hypocritical or taking advantage of the situation. \n\nAlso, the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, which is different from forgetting. The driver is upset about not getting tips, which is a business concern. But using the police to address this could be problematic. The police's role is to enforce laws, not to handle tipping disputes. So even if the customer is using weed illegally, the driver's main issue isn't the weed but the lack of tips. \n\nAnother angle: the driver is in a position where they interact with customers regularly. Reporting someone for personal gain might damage the business's reputation if the situation is taken to the police. The pizza place might not want drivers making random reports. Also, the driver could face repercussions if they're seen as using the law for personal benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer is clearly not tipping, which is a business practice. However, tipping is voluntary, and the driver can't force the customer to tip. The illegal activity part is a separate issue, but the driver's main grievance is financial. So the driver is conflating two different issues here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's intent is to get money. That's a conflict. The right thing would be to report illegal activity regardless of personal gain, but if the driver is doing it for revenge or to get tips, that's not appropriate. \n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? If they report the customer with the primary intent of getting them to tip, then yes, they are acting out of self-interest in a way that's not appropriate. The police aren't there to handle tipping disputes. Therefore, the answer would be that the driver is in the wrong (A) because they're using a legal issue to address a personal financial grievance, which is unethical.\n"
