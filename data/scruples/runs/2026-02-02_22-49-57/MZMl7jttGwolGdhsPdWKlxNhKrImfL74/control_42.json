Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times, and each time the customer was clearly under the influence of weed. The driver isn't against people using weed personally but notes it's illegal where they live. The customer is also one of their farthest deliveries, costing them money. The driver is considering reporting the customer to the police and is asking if they'd be an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the act of reporting a customer for not tipping versus for drug use, and potential motivations behind the report.\n\nIf weed is illegal, then using it is a crime. The customer is clearly under the influence and not tipping, which is affecting the driver's income. However, the driver's primary role is to deliver food, not to enforce drug laws. Reporting someone for drug use is typically a police matter, and unless the driver witnessed an actual illegal act (like purchasing drugs from someone else), it might be overstepping. The fact that the customer is leaving $0.00 in the tip section might indicate intentional non-tipping, but that's separate from drug use.\n\nBut the driver is considering reporting the customer because they're high, not because they're buying drugs. If the driver is just reporting the customer for being high, which is an observed condition rather than an active illegal transaction, the police might not take action unless there's more evidence. Also, the driver's motivation might be financial, which could be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain rather than genuine concern for illegal activity. This could make the driver's intentions questionable, potentially making them the asshole for trying to exploit the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law by using an illegal substance, they might feel it's their duty to report. However, in many places, simple possession of small amounts of weed is a low-level offense, and actively pursuing a customer for that could be seen as overreaching. Also, the driver isn't in a position to enforce drug laws; that's the police's role. The driver's main issue is the lack of tips and the financial loss from distant delivery, so using a legal report as a means to address that could be considered wrong.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong (A) because they might be using the law as a tool to address their financial grievances rather than a genuine concern for illegal activity. Reporting someone for drug use based solely on smelling weed and not tipping could be seen as an overreaction and exploiting the situation for personal gain.\n"
