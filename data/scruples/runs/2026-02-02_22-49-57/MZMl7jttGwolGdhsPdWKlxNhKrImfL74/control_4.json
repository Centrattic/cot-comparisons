Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips four times from a customer. Each time, the customer was smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The driver is considering reporting them because they lose money on these deliveries and the customer intentionally didn't tip. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their area, then using it is against the law. But does that mean the driver is justified in reporting them? The driver's main issue is the lack of tips, not the weed itself. They mention they don't mind people smoking, but the customer's actions are illegal.\n\nHowever, the driver's motivation here is financial gain. They're upset about not getting tips and losing money. Reporting someone for a non-violent, personal activity might be seen as using the law for personal benefit rather than public safety. That could be considered unethical or an abuse of the reporting system.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of discretion. Should someone report a customer simply because they didn't tip? The driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce the law. They might be overstepping by using the police to address a business-related issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the driver might feel they have a duty to report. But the key point is that the driver's primary grievance is about tips, not the weed use itself. That could suggest the report is retaliatory, which would be problematic. \n\nSo, the driver might be in the wrong because they're using the law to solve a personal issue rather than a genuine legal concern. The right thing would be to address the tipping issue through their employer or by avoiding the route if possible, not by involving the police for a minor offense.\n"
