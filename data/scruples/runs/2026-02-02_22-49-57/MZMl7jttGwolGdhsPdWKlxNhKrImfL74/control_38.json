Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is high on weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the driver notices the smell of weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries, and the customer intentionally leaves $0.00.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So, if the customer is using it, that's technically a crime. But the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not enforce the law. Reporting someone for a non-violent crime like possession might be seen as overstepping, especially if the driver's main grievance is about not getting tips. \n\nThen there's the question of ethics. The driver relies on tips for income, which is common in service jobs. The customer is choosing not to tip, which is within their rights (though maybe not good practice). The driver might feel wronged, but is it fair to report someone to the police over unpaid tips? That could be seen as using the law as a weapon, which is morally questionable. \n\nAlso, the driver's motivation is financial. They lose money on the delivery, so reporting might be a way to get back the tip. But is that a valid reason? The police might not take such a report seriously if it's just about unpaid tips, especially if the weed use is separate. \n\nAnother angle: the customer's right to privacy. The driver is making a judgment based on the smell of weed. Are they sure the customer is using it illegally? Maybe the customer has a medical card or it's legal in some form. The driver might be making an incorrect assumption, which could lead to a false report. \n\nIn terms of the driver's rights, they can't force the customer to tip. The customer isn't obligated to pay. So the driver's anger is understandable, but the solution of involving the police might be disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law. But since the main issue is about tips, and using the law for that might be wrong, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong). Hmm. \n\nWait, the user is in a place where weed is illegal. If the customer is using it, then it's a crime. The driver could argue they're reporting a crime. But the problem is the driver's primary reason is the tip. The question is whether the report is justified. If the driver is using the weed as an excuse to get the customer in trouble over unpaid tips, that's wrong. But if they genuinely believe the customer is committing a crime (weed use), then maybe not. \n\nBut in many cases, police might not act on a tip about weed use unless there's more evidence. The driver's observation of the smell isn't concrete proof. Also, the driver might be overstepping their role. So the answer could be A because the driver is using a personal grievance to report a minor crime, which is not appropriate. Hence, the author is in the wrong.\n"
