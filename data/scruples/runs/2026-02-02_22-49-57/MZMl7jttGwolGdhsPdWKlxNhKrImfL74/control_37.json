Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be smoking weed. The driver says the customer leaves $0.00 in tips intentionally, not forgetting. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if weed is illegal where they live, then the customer's possession could be a crime. But just because someone is using an illegal substance doesn't mean the driver has a right to report them unless they have a valid reason. The customer's weed use isn't directly affecting the delivery, right? The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce the law. So maybe the driver is overstepping.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. Tipping is a social norm, but it's not a legal requirement. The customer isn't obligated to tip, even if they're high. The driver is upset because they lose money on this delivery, but that's a business consideration. However, using the customer's personal choices (like smoking weed) as a reason to report them is problematic. The driver's motivation seems to be about the tips, not the illegal activity. So maybe the driver is using the weed as an excuse to report someone who just doesn't tip.\n\nAlso, the question is about the driver's actions. Reporting someone to the police should be based on actual illegal activity, not personal grievances. If the customer's weed use is indeed illegal, then technically the driver could report it, but doing so for the purpose of getting a tip is ethically wrong. The driver might be using the law as a weapon against a customer they find inconvenient, which is not appropriate.\n\nIn terms of morality, the driver is in a position of power here. Using the threat of reporting to police to get tipped is exploitative. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's primary duty is to their job, not to act as a law enforcer for personal gain.\n\nSo putting it all together: the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, not the weed usage. They're considering reporting someone illegal activity as a means to get what they want. That's not the right approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
