Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: If smoking weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law. The driver is not a police officer, so they can't enforce the law directly. However, reporting someone to the police for a crime they've witnessed is generally within their rights. So legally, the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The driver mentions they lose money on this delivery because it's far. The customer deliberately tips $0.00, which the driver sees as intentional. The driver relies on tips for income. On one hand, the customer is violating the law, so reporting them might be justified. On the other hand, using a tip as a reason to report someone for a crime they've witnessed could be seen as using a personal grievance to get a legal action done. That might be considered a bit of a stretch, but if the driver is genuinely reporting the illegal activity, not just the lack of tip, then it's more about upholding the law.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The driver might be motivated by the tip issue, which could make the situation seem like a vendetta. However, if the driver can provide evidence (like the smell of weed, which is observable, and maybe the customer being visibly under the influence), then the report is based on actual illegal activity. The question is whether the driver's intent is to enforce the law or retaliate for not getting tips.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, citizens can report crimes they witness, even if they have a personal stake. But if the report is seen as a misuse of the system to settle a personal score, it could be problematic. However, the driver is not in the wrong if they genuinely believe the customer is committing a crime and they report it as such. The key is whether the report is based on factual observations of illegal activity, not just the tip issue.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the driver is reporting for the illegal activity or using that as a pretext for the tip. The driver's reasoning includes both, but the main justification is the illegal weed use. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong if their primary motivation is the illegal activity, even if they mention the tip as a contributing factor.\n"
