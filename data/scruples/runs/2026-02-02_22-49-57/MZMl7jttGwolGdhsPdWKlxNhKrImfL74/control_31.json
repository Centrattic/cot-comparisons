Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. They noticed the customer smells like weed each time and the customer writes $0.00 in the tip. The user is considering reporting them because weed is illegal where they live. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user's main grievance is about not getting tips. The customer is intentionally not tipping, which affects the user's income since tips are a significant part of their pay. The user also mentions losing money on these deliveries because it's a far location. So, there's a financial incentive to report the customer, but does that justify it?\n\nThe user isn't against smoking weed personally but thinks it's illegal. However, the act of smoking weed is between the customer and the law. The user is a delivery driver, not a law enforcer. Reporting someone for a personal reason like lack of tips might overstep their role. \n\nAlso, there's a nuance here. The user might be using the weed as an excuse to report someone who they perceive as not tipping enough. The question is whether the user has a legitimate reason to report them. If the customer is indeed using illegal substances, then maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But the user's primary motive seems to be about the tips, not the legality of the weed. \n\nIn some places, reporting a customer for a nonviolent offense just because they aren't tipping could be seen as retaliatory. The user's job is to deliver food, not to police their customers. There's also the aspect of privacy; the user might be misinterpreting the smell of weed or not being certain. \n\nSo, even if the customer is using weed illegally, the user's main issue is financial. Using the law as a tool for personal gain here might be inappropriate. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong for considering reporting the customer primarily for not tipping, which is a separate issue from the legality of weed. The user should address the tipping issue through proper channels, like the pizza place's management, instead of reporting to the police.\n"
