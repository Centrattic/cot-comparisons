Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong if they report a customer for smoking weed because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times. The author is a delivery driver who loses money on each delivery to this customer. The customer smells like weed each time and writes $0.00 in the tip section. The author doesn't have a problem with weed personally but thinks it's illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In some places, cannabis is legal, so if the customer is using it legally, the author might be wrong to report them. However, the author mentions it's illegal where they live. So if that's the case, the customer is breaking the law. But the author is using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them, which could be seen as using a legal issue to retaliate for not tipping.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the author's income. But is using a legal issue to get back at someone for not tipping ethical? The author might feel wronged because they lose money on each delivery, but reporting someone for a legal violation isn't necessarily unethical if it's true. However, if the author's main motive is revenge for not getting tips, that could be seen as wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the customer explicitly writes $0.00, so they don't forget. The author relies on tips to make a living. The author's job is to deliver food, not to police customers for drug use. Even if the customer is using illegal drugs, the author isn't in a position to enforce the law. That's the police's job. So the author might be overstepping their role here.\n\nAlso, the author isn't in a position to know for sure if the customer is using drugs. They just smell weed. There's a possibility of a misunderstanding, like the customer has a legal product or the smell is from something else. Reporting based on suspicion could be problematic.\n\nSo, even though the customer isn't tipping, the author's motive here might be more about revenge or financial gain rather than upholding the law. That could make the author in the wrong because they're using a legal report as a tool for personal gain instead of letting the authorities handle it if there's a valid reason. Plus, the author isn't a law enforcement officer, so they shouldn't be making that judgment call.\n"
