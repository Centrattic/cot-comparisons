Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be a bad person for reporting a customer to the police because he hasn't tipped them multiple times and smells like weed. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is smoking weed, that's a crime. The user wants to report them for that. But is it their place to do so? Legally, anyone can report a crime they witness, right? But maybe there's a nuance here.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip each time. The driver relies on tips for income and loses money on this far delivery. So there's financial motivation. The driver is upset about the lack of tips and the customer's possible drug use. \n\nBut wait, the driver is using the customer's alleged illegal activity as the reason for reporting. However, the main motive might be the tips. That could be a problem. If the driver is using the weed as an excuse to get even with a bad tipper, that's different than reporting for actual safety or legal enforcement. \n\nAlso, is the driver sure the customer is smoking weed? The customer smells like it, but that's not proof. The driver might be making an assumption based on smell. Could there be other explanations? Maybe the customer used a product that smells like weed, or they handled it without smoking. \n\nThe driver's job is to deliver food, not to enforce the law. Maybe their role isn't to report customers unless there's immediate danger. But if someone is using an illegal substance, others could report it. However, if the driver's main issue is the tips and they're using weed as a reason, that might be crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the customer not tipping is a separate issue. The driver can't force the customer to tip, and reporting them for that isn't legal. So the driver is conflating two issues here. \n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? If they report the customer primarily out of spite for not tipping, even if the weed part is true, it's using a legal charge to retaliate. That would make them in the wrong. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law and report it in good faith, maybe not. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering their stated motives. \n\nThe user says they \"make $5 an hour\" and \"rely on tips.\" Their main grievance is the lack of tips, but they use the weed as an excuse to report. The real issue is the tips, not the weed. Since the user is using a legal violation as a way to get back at someone for not tipping, they might be in the wrong. The correct approach would be to address the tipping issue through the company or customer service, not through a report that's partly motivated by revenge.\n"
