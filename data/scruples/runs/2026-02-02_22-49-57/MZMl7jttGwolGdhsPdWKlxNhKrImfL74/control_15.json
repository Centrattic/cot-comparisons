Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who smokes weed and doesn't tip. The situation is that the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time he's clearly under the influence of weed. The driver mentions that he doesn't have a problem with weed personally, but it's illegal where they live. Also, delivering to this customer is a long distance, so the driver loses money each time. The customer intentionally sets the tip to $0.00, not forgetting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal in their area, then using it is against the law. However, the driver is considering reporting someone for a private activity. The customer is in their home, so unless the driver has evidence of illegal activity beyond just smelling weed (like manufacturing or selling), it's a private matter. The police might not take a complaint about someone smoking weed at home unless there's a specific violation beyond personal use.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The driver is upset about the lack of tips and the financial loss from the long delivery. They make minimum wage plus tips, so not getting tips is a significant issue. However, using the weed as a reason to report the customer could be seen as taking advantage of the situation for personal gain. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, but they're using the illegal activity as a pretext. That might be considered unethical because the primary motive isn't to enforce the law but to get money.\n\nAlso, the customer is clearly setting the tip to zero, which is their legal right. They don't have to tip, even if they're high. The driver can't force someone to tip. So, the driver's motivation here is more about financial loss than legal compliance.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the question is whether the driver is justified. If the driver's main issue is the tips, and they're using the weed as an excuse, they might be considered in the wrong because they're trying to leverage a legal issue to get what they want. However, if the customer is indeed violating the law by smoking weed (which is a gray area since personal use is sometimes legal in some places but not others), then reporting it could be justified. But given the context that the driver doesn't mention any other illegal activities beyond the smell of weed, it's likely a personal use case, which in some places is legal. Wait, the user says it's illegal where they live, so the customer is in violation. But the police might not act on a complaint about personal use unless there's a specific reason beyond the driver's financial grievance.\n\nSo the key points are: the driver's primary issue is lack of tips, the customer is not tipping intentionally, the driver is using the weed as a reason to report them. The driver's action could be seen as retaliatory and not in good faith. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are using a legal issue as a pretext for their personal grievances about tips and financial loss. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
