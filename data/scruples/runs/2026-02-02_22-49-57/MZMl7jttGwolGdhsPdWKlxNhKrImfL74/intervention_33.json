Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly smoking weed. The main points here are the legality of weed in their area and the tip issue.\n\nFirst, the person is reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. So legally, if they see someone using an illegal substance, they might have a duty to report it. But wait, the driver's role is just to deliver pizza. They might not be in a position to enforce the law, but if they observe a crime, maybe they have the right to report it. However, there's a question about whether they should intervene just because of a tip issue.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The driver mentioned losing money on this delivery and relying on tips. The customer consistently tips $0, which affects their income. But is that a valid reason to report someone for a separate issue? The driver might feel wronged due to the lack of tips, but the act of smoking weed is a different matter. \n\nBut maybe there's a conflict of interest here. The driver's motivation is partly financial, which could be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain. That might make the decision more complicated. Also, the customer is stoned but not acting in a way that's harmful, just using an illegal substance. The driver isn't in danger, so is it necessary to report them?\n\nOn the other hand, the driver isn't making this up; they've observed it multiple times. If the law is being broken, the driver might have a responsibility to report it regardless of their personal feelings. But if the driver's main issue is the tip, then using the weed as an excuse to get back at the customer for not tipping could be wrong.\n\nSo, the key factors are the legality of reporting someone for a crime they witness versus using it as retaliation for not tipping. The driver isn't in the wrong if they're reporting a crime, but if they're using the situation to get revenge, that's where it gets tricky. Since the driver states they have no problem with weed in general but are reporting because it's illegal, maybe they're acting on the law. However, the underlying motivation of lost income might cloud their judgment. \n\nIn the end, the legality of the act is the main issue. If smoking weed is illegal, the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting it. But the context of their personal financial struggle and the customer's behavior might influence whether others see it as a justified action or an overreach. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the driver is reporting a crime, even if their motivation is partially financial. However, others might argue that using the law for personal gain is wrong. But legally, if it's a crime, reporting it is their right.\n"
