Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip them and smells like weed. The key points here are: the customer hasn't tipped four times, the driver smells weed each time, and the delivery is one of the farthest, causing them to lose money. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. But just because someone smells like weed doesn't necessarily mean they're using it. Maybe the smell is from something else, or they have it in their house but aren't smoking. The driver might be making an assumption here, which could be problematic. Also, even if the customer is using weed, does the driver have a right to report them for that? It's a privacy issue. The police might not take a report just based on someone's smell without more evidence.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer sets the tip to $0.00 each time, which is a conscious choice. The driver might feel this is unfair, especially since they're losing money on that delivery. But is it the driver's place to report the customer for not tipping? The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, and tips are a customer's decision. Reporting someone to the police for not tipping isn't a valid legal reason. So maybe the driver is conflating two separate issues: the tips and the weed smell.\n\nEthically, the driver might feel wronged because they're not getting tips, but the solution isn't to report the customer for something unrelated (weed use) just because they're unhappy with the tip. It could be seen as a form of retaliation. Also, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, not the weed. So using the weed as a reason to report might be a way to address the real issue indirectly, which isn't appropriate.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the driver isn't necessarily wrong in feeling frustrated, but the action of reporting the customer for a possible minor infraction (which they might not have evidence for) could make them an asshole. The real problem is the customer not tipping, but that's not a legal matter. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they're using a possible illegal activity as a pretext to address their main issue with the tips, which isn't their place to handle.\n"
