Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and the driver feels they lose money on each delivery to this person.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about legality and the user's personal situation. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live, and the customer is clearly under its influence each time. The user isn't against weed personally but sees it as a legal issue. The main question is whether the user is justified in reporting the customer for their own gain\u2014specifically, to get a tip.\n\nNow, legally speaking, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the user might have a valid reason to report them. However, the user's motivation here is tied to financial gain. They\u2019re wondering if they\u2019re an asshole for doing this. The user's job is to deliver food, not to enforce the law. The problem is that using someone else's illegal activity to get a tip (which is not guaranteed) might be seen as exploiting the situation for personal benefit rather than acting out of genuine concern for legal compliance.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the tip being optional. The customer is choosing to tip $0.00, and while that's frustrating for the driver, it's their right. The driver can't force someone to tip. So, if the driver reports someone solely because they didn't tip, even if the customer is breaking the law, it could be seen as using a legal issue to gain a financial advantage. That might make the driver look like they're in the wrong, because their primary motive isn't about upholding the law but about getting a tip.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed in violation of the law, the driver might have a duty to report it, regardless of personal gain. But the driver's situation where they lose money on the delivery complicates things. Their intent could be perceived as self-serving rather than altruistic. So, the driver's actions here might be considered unethical or even inappropriate, as they're using the potential legal issue to pressure the customer into tipping, which isn't their role.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the driver is in the wrong because their primary motive is to secure a tip, not to report an illegal activity. The right thing would be to report if they genuinely believe the law is being broken, not for financial gain.\n"
