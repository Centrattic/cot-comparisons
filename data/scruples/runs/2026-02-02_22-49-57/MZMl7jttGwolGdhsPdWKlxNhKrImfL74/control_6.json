Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is always high on weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver is wondering if reporting the customer is the right thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal where they live, then using it is a crime. The customer is openly smoking, which the driver notices because of the smell. So, if the driver reports this, it's technically legal. But there's a nuance here. The driver's main grievance is about not getting tipped, not about the weed use. So is the driver using the weed as a reason to report someone just because they didn't tip?\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The driver relies on tips for income, which is common in service jobs. The customer's not tipping could be seen as unfair, but the driver choosing to report them for a legal issue (weed) instead of addressing the tipping issue directly might be problematic. It could look like a vendetta or misuse of the law for personal gain.\n\nAlso, the driver mentions losing money on each delivery to this customer. That adds to the frustration. But even so, using the law to get back at someone for not tipping might not be the right approach. The customer isn't a criminal for not tipping, even if it's against company policy. However, if the customer is breaking the law by using illegal substances, reporting them could be justified.\n\nBut here's the catch: the driver has to be sure that the customer is indeed using an illegal substance. If weed is legal in their jurisdiction, then there's no issue. The driver's claim is that it's illegal. So, if it's illegal, then reporting could be appropriate. But maybe the driver's main motivation is revenge for not getting tips, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the driver's primary reason is the money, then they might be using the law as a tool to punish someone they don't like, which is unethical. However, if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, then they have a duty to report it. The key here is whether the report is motivated by the legal violation or the personal grievance.\n\nAnother angle: the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, which is different from forgetting. Deliberate no-tipping might be more offensive. But still, the driver's recourse would normally be to address it with the employer or the company, not to involve the police unless there's a real legal issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If the customer is indeed violating the law by using an illegal substance, then reporting them isn't inherently wrong. However, if the driver is doing it primarily out of spite for not receiving tips, then it's a misuse of the legal system. The answer might hinge on the driver's intent. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the intent is to take advantage of the legal system to get even over a personal matter, then yes, they're in the wrong. But if they're genuinely reporting a crime, then no. The scenario states that weed is illegal there, so the act is a crime. Therefore, the driver isn't wrong in reporting a crime, even if they have a personal motive. However, ethics-wise, using the legal system for personal gain is a gray area. But legally, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
