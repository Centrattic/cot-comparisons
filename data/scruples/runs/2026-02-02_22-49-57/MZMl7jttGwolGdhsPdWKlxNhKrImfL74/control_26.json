Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is clearly high. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is smoking marijuana, which is against the law, then reporting them could be a valid action. However, the user is a delivery driver, not a law enforcement officer. Do they have the right to report someone for something they observe? Maybe, but it's a gray area.\n\nNext, the tipping issue. The customer intentionally tips $0, and the user relies on tips for income. The user feels wronged because the customer is stoned and doesn't tip. But is it the driver's responsibility to enforce tipping laws or company policies? The user might not be in the wrong for wanting to hold the customer accountable for not tipping, especially if the customer is making a conscious choice to leave no tip.\n\nBut the user is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed. The question is whether the driver should take on the role of a citizen's arrest or report someone for a personal reason. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips. There's a motive here that's more about personal gain rather than upholding the law. \n\nAlso, the user is losing money on each delivery due to the distance. That adds to their frustration. However, using the illegal activity as an excuse to report the customer might be seen as using the law for personal benefit. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed violating the law, the driver isn't obligated to ignore it. But is the driver overstepping by reporting someone for something they didn't witness firsthand? The smell of weed and the customer's behavior might be indicators, but are they enough for a valid report? \n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for feeling wronged by the lack of tips. However, using the illegal activity to report the customer could be problematic. The user's primary issue is the tip, but they're using the weed as a justification. That might make their action seem more like retaliation than a genuine report. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user's main issue is the lack of tips, and reporting the customer for weed use could be seen as using the law for personal gain. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because their motivation is mixed, and they're not a law enforcement officer. However, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the user isn't obligated to ignore it. But the primary motive here is the tip, which complicates things. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is that the user is not in the wrong because they have the right to report a crime, even if they have a personal motive. But others might argue that using the law for personal gain is wrong. It's a tricky situation. The user's main problem is the tip, but they found a legal reason to report. So is the user in the wrong? I think the user is not in the wrong because they are reporting a potential crime, even if their motive is mixed. The question is whether they are in the wrong for doing so. The answer is B (No).\n"
