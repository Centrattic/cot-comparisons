Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who didn't tip multiple times and was smoking weed. The author is a delivery driver who loses money on each delivery to this customer. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip, and the author makes $5 an hour relying on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is smoking weed, then the author reporting them for that would be a legal action. However, the main issue here is the tipping. The customer isn't tipping, but the author is considering reporting for the weed use. \n\nBut wait, the author's main grievance is the lack of tips. They lose money on each delivery and rely on tips. The weed smell and being stoned are just observations. The question is whether reporting someone for not tipping is justified. Legally, not tipping isn't a criminal offense. So the author can't report for that. But the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal. So the author is considering reporting for the weed use, not the tips. \n\nBut is it ethical? The author is using the weed as an excuse to report the customer because of the lack of tips. That might be a problem. The author's primary motivation is the lack of tips, but the actual legal issue is the weed. However, if the author reports the customer primarily to get them to tip, that could be seen as a misuse of the reporting system. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely reporting because they see someone using an illegal substance, then maybe it's their duty. But the author is a delivery driver, not a law enforcement officer. They might have the right to call the police if they suspect illegal activity. However, the author's intent here is mixed. They might be using the weed as a reason to get back at the customer for not tipping. \n\nThe key points are: the customer's actions (not tipping and using an illegal substance) and the author's intent (reporting for legal reasons or for revenge). Since the author is making a living with tips, the lack of tips affects their income. But legally, not tipping isn't a crime. Reporting the customer for weed use is legal, but if the author's primary motive is the tips, then it's a moral issue. \n\nIn terms of ethics, using the legal system to address a personal grievance (lack of tips) might be considered wrong. The author could be seen as exploiting the situation to get revenge. However, if the author is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, then maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is reporting for the right reasons. If the author is using the weed as an excuse to retaliate, then they're in the wrong. If they're reporting because they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law (weed use), then maybe not. But since the main context is the tipping issue, the author's motivation is likely mixed. \n\nGiven that the author is making $5 an hour and relies on tips, the pressure to get tips is real. But using the law to enforce personal compensation is not appropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering reporting the customer primarily because of the lack of tips, using the weed as a pretext.\n"
