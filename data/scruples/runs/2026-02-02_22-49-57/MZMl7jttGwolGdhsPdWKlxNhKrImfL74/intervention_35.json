Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's been getting zero tips from a customer who smells like weed. The user is considering reporting the customer for smoking in public since it's illegal where they live. The main points are: multiple zero tips, the customer is high, the user loses money on these deliveries, and the user's income relies heavily on tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. If smoking weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law. The user is a delivery driver, so their job is to deliver food, not to enforce laws. However, if they believe the customer is engaging in illegal activity, they might feel justified in reporting them. But is it their responsibility to report others? That's a gray area. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The customer isn't just forgetting to tip; they're intentionally entering a zero tip. The user says they make $5 an hour and depend on tips. So, each zero tip is a direct hit to their income. The user is frustrated, and maybe the weed smell is just a symptom of the bigger issue of lack of tips.\n\nBut is smoking weed the root cause here? Maybe the customer is just being cheap, regardless of the state. Or maybe the weed use is a separate issue. The user might be conflating the two. They could be using the weed as an excuse to report someone who's just not tipping them. \n\nAlso, the user's job doesn't inherently require them to monitor or report illegal activities by customers. So, stepping into that role might be overstepping. However, if they genuinely believe the customer is violating the law, they might feel it's their civic duty to report. \n\nBut the user is in a position of power here. They have access to the customer's address and personal information for deliveries. Reporting someone without concrete evidence (just the smell of weed) could lead to privacy issues or false accusations. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer is actively choosing not to tip. The user is within their rights to not serve them or take other actions, but reporting to the police might be a stretch unless there's clear evidence of illegal activity. The smell of weed isn't enough to prove possession or use, especially if it's not in the driver's presence. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the user is under financial stress and might feel justified in their actions. But if their main issue is the lack of tips, then the weed is a different problem. The user could be using the weed as a reason to report someone who's just being stingy. \n\nLegally, the user isn't in the wrong if they believe the customer is breaking the law. But morally, it's questionable whether they're overstepping their role as a delivery driver. The answer might hinge on whether the tip issue is the real motivation versus the weed. If the user is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, it's a civic duty. If it's about the tips, then it's crossing a line.\n"
