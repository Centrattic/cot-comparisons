Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and seems high on weed. The situation is that the customer has left $0.00 tips four times, and each time the driver noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The driver also mentions that this customer is one of their farthest, so they actually lose money on each delivery. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the intentionality of the customer not tipping, and the driver's reliance on tips for income.\n\nFirst, the user is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed. But the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for doing that. Since the driver is a delivery driver, their job is to deliver the pizza, not to monitor the customer's activities. The fact that the customer isn't tipping is a separate issue. The driver's main responsibility is to provide service, and the customer's choice to use weed is a personal matter, even if it's illegal. However, the driver is not a law enforcement officer, so they might not be in the right to report someone for something they observed during a private interaction, unless they have a reasonable suspicion of a crime and it's part of their job to report such things. But in most cases, that's not the case for delivery drivers.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer intentionally left $0.00, which the driver finds problematic because they rely on tips. While the driver can certainly be upset about the lack of tips, using that as a reason to report the customer for a personal drug use issue seems like a stretch. The driver's financial situation is understandable, but retaliating by reporting the customer for a non-work-related activity, especially when the customer isn't breaking any rules the driver is responsible for enforcing, could be seen as vindictive.\n\nAlso, the fact that the customer is stoned but not acting in a dangerous way\u2014just smelling like weed\u2014doesn't necessarily indicate a crime. Unless the customer is doing something illegal that directly affects the driver, like threatening them or causing a disturbance, the driver might not have a valid reason to report them. The driver's main concern is the lack of tips, which is a business practice issue, not a legal one. The customer could be choosing not to tip for various reasons, and the driver's personal opinion about the customer's drug use isn't a justification for a report.\n\nSo, the driver's motivation is primarily about the tips, and the weed use is just a factor they've noticed. Reporting someone for a non-violent, non-threatening act like smoking weed in their own home, even if the driver disapproves, is likely an overreach. It's about balancing personal ethics with professional conduct. The driver might be within their rights to report if they believe a crime is occurring, but using it as a means to address the lack of tips is probably not appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions are driven by a personal grievance rather than a legitimate legal concern.\n"
