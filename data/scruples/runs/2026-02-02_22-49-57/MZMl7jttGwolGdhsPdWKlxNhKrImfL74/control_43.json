Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for not tipping them multiple times. The customer doesn't tip and the driver thinks it's because he's smoking weed. The driver is in a place where weed is illegal, so they want to report him. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking about doing that.\n\nFirst, the main points: The customer didn't tip four times, and during those times, he smelled like weed. The driver is losing money on the delivery because it's a far location. They earn $5 an hour plus tips, so tips are crucial. The customer writes $0.00, not forgetting but choosing not to tip.\n\nNow, the legality of weed where they live. If the customer is using an illegal drug, reporting that is a legal action. But is that a valid reason for not tipping? The driver is using the customer's drug use as a justification for reporting them, even though the customer's refusal to tip is the main issue here.\n\nSo, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, not the drug use. They might be conflating the two. Even if the customer were under the influence, refusing to tip is a separate issue. The driver is considering using the drug use as a pretext to report the customer for not tipping. But legally, reporting someone for not tipping isn't valid. The law doesn't require people to tip. So, the driver is using the drug use as a reason to report someone for a non-criminal act (not tipping), which is a civil matter.\n\nHowever, if the customer is using an illegal drug, that's a separate crime. The driver might be correct in reporting the drug use, but that's not the main issue. The driver's primary motivation is the lack of tips. So, the driver is using the drug use as a means to get back at the customer for not tipping. That's a form of retaliation, which is unethical. \n\nAlso, the driver is in a service job, and customers have the right to choose not to tip, even if they're under the influence. The driver's action could be seen as abusive of their position. Reporting someone for not tipping is not appropriate, even if the customer is doing something illegal. The driver's actions are targeting the customer for a legal matter (tips) by using an illegal act (if the customer is indeed using an illegal drug) as a lever. This could be considered wrong because it's using a minor offense to address a non-offense.\n\nMoreover, the driver's main issue is financial. They need tips to make a living, which is understandable. However, using a potential drug-related report to address that is not the right approach. The driver should instead focus on other ways to handle the situation, like adjusting their routes or setting boundaries, but not using illegal means.\n\nSo, the author is wrong in thinking they can report the customer for not tipping by citing drug use as a reason. They're conflating two issues and using one to justify the other, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
