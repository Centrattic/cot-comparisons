Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly under the influence of weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time the driver notices the smell of weed, and the customer explicitly enters $0.00 in the tip. The driver is losing money on these deliveries because it's a far location, and they rely heavily on tips since their base pay is only $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, the legality of weed is a key point here. The user mentions that it's illegal in their area. So, if the customer is using a controlled substance in a place where it's against the law, then technically, the driver could report that. However, there's a nuance here. The driver's main grievance is about the lack of tips and the personal impact on their income. The weed use might be a red herring or an excuse to report the customer. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting. Legally, if weed is illegal, the driver might not be in the wrong for reporting the usage. However, there's a moral aspect. The driver's primary role is to deliver the pizza, not to police customers' activities unless they're violating laws that the driver is obligated to report. But if the customer is under the influence to the point of being a danger or committing another crime, that's different. Here, the customer is just smoking weed, which is illegal but not necessarily a public safety issue. \n\nAlso, the driver is using the weed use as a justification for reporting someone who doesn't tip. The customer isn't forgetting the tip because they're high; they're deliberately entering $0.00. So the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, and the weed is a secondary factor. Reporting someone for not tipping is a different matter. If the driver is using the weed as a pretext to get around not being able to confront the customer about the tip, that could be seen as a misuse of the police. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, you can't just report someone for a civil matter (like not tipping) by using a criminal law (like drug use). The tip issue is a business matter between the customer and the business. The driver might not have standing to report the tip issue. Using the drug use as a way to circumvent that could be problematic. \n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of the driver's responsibility. If the customer is smoking in their own home, the driver might not be in a position to police that. Unless the customer is in a public place or the driver is committing a citizen's arrest, which is a stretch here. \n\nSo, the driver's intention might be a mix of valid concern (illegal activity) and personal grievance (lack of tips). If the driver is genuinely reporting the drug use, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're using the drug use as a reason to report for the tip issue, that's a different story. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the driver's intent and the legality of the situation. \n\nIn some places, even if it's illegal, the driver might not have the authority to report unless they witness a crime. If the customer is smoking in their home, maybe that's a private matter. Unless there's a public consumption law, but the user says it's illegal where they live. However, if it's only illegal in certain contexts, like public places, then maybe the customer isn't violating the law. \n\nAlso, the user is a delivery driver, so they might be delivering the pizza when the customer is already consuming the drug. The timing here matters. If the customer is under the influence at home, the driver might not be in a position to enforce the law. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the driver's primary motivation is the lack of tips, using the drug use as a justification. This could be seen as using the police to address a civil issue, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for wanting to report the customer primarily for not tipping, using the drug use as a pretext. However, if the drug use is a genuine concern and the customer is violating the law, then the driver might not be in the wrong. But given that the main issue is the lack of tips, the answer likely is that the author is in the wrong (A). But this is a bit of a gray area. The key is the intent. If the report is motivated by the drug use, which is illegal, then maybe not. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is using the drug use as a reason to report someone who isn't tipping, the answer is A (in the wrong) because it's a misuse of the legal system for a personal grievance.\n"
