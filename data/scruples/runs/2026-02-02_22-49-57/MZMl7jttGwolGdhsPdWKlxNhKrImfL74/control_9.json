Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the pizza delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe driver is a delivery person, and the customer hasn't tipped them four times. Each time, the driver notices the customer is high on weed, which is illegal where they live. The driver mentions losing money on these deliveries because the customer is far away. They also note that the customer intentionally puts $0 in the tip, not forgetting. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nThe main question is whether reporting the customer for weed use is justified. Let's consider the legal aspect first. If weed is illegal in their location, then using it is against the law. However, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer, so they might not have the authority to report someone just because they notice them. But maybe there are other ways to report it, like calling the police anonymously if they suspect a crime.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The driver is upset about not getting tips and losing money. They might feel justified in reporting the customer, but is that the right approach? Some might argue that the driver is using the customer's illegal activity as a way to get revenge for not tipping, which could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Others might say that if the customer is breaking the law, it's their duty to report it, regardless of the tip.\n\nAlso, the driver mentions that the customer doesn't forget the tip but intentionally gives zero. That's a factor in their frustration. However, the act of reporting someone for personal gain (more tips) might make the situation ethically questionable. There's a balance between legal obligations and personal ethics here.\n\nI should also think about the consequences. If the driver reports the customer, the police might investigate and confirm the illegal activity. But if the police don't act, the driver could face backlash or be seen as a snitch. Additionally, there's the possibility that the customer's weed use isn't related to the tip amount. The driver might be conflating two separate issues: the customer's legal behavior and their own financial loss from tips.\n\nAnother angle: the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to police their customers. If they start reporting customers for personal reasons, it could lead to a hostile work environment or legal issues if the reports are false. But if the driver genuinely believes a crime is occurring, they have a duty to report it, even if they have a personal vendetta.\n\nIn terms of the question, is the author in the wrong? If the author reports the customer, it's a matter of whether their intent is to enforce the law or retaliate for not getting tips. If it's the latter, then they might be in the wrong. But if they genuinely want to report a crime, they might not be. However, their motivation here seems mixed. They mention relying on tips and losing money, which could influence their decision. So, there's a conflict between their personal financial interests and their duty to report a crime.\n\nThe answer might depend on jurisdiction. In some places, citizens can report crimes they observe, but if it's a personal vendetta, it could be problematic. However, since the customer's weed use is illegal, the driver isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting it. But the ethical stance here is debatable. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because if the customer is breaking the law, reporting them is legally permissible, even if the driver has a personal motive. But the ethical aspect is more complex. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is a mix of legal and ethical considerations, the answer could be B, as the act itself isn't illegal, even if ethically questionable.\n"
