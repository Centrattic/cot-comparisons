Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're an asshole for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells of weed. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's behavior, and the driver's financial reliance on tips.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is using weed, even if the driver isn't against it personally, the law is against it. The customer is also being a regular no-tipper, which is affecting the driver's income since they make $5 an hour and depend on tips. The driver loses money on each delivery to this faraway customer. \n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for reporting. Legally, if the customer is breaking the law by using weed, the driver has a right to report that. However, there's a nuance. The driver is using the tip issue as a reason to report someone for a personal action (smoking weed) that's illegal but might not be directly related to the delivery service. The customer is choosing not to tip, which is their right, even if it's frustrating for the driver. \n\nBut the driver's livelihood is on the line here. They need tips to make a living wage. The fact that the customer is intentionally not tipping (writes $0.00) adds to the driver's justification. However, using the weed as a reason to report might be a stretch if the driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips. Even though weed is illegal, the driver might not have a duty to police others' personal activities unless they see something that's a direct law violation. \n\nBut wait, if the customer is smoking weed on the premises or in a public place where it's illegal, the driver could argue they're reporting a crime. However, if the customer is just consuming weed at home, maybe it's not a public issue. The driver might not have a clear view of the customer's actions beyond smelling weed during delivery. \n\nSo, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, which is a business issue. Reporting someone for a personal activity (smoking weed) to get more tips could be seen as using a legal issue to solve a financial problem, which might be ethically questionable. Even if the driver is within their legal rights, it might not be the right thing to do morally. \n\nOn the other hand, if the driver believes the customer is violating the law (smoking weed illegally), they have a right to report that. But if the driver's primary motive is financial gain, it could be seen as exploiting a legal system for personal benefit. The line here is thin. \n\nIn many cases, people consider it wrong to report someone for personal reasons rather than public safety. Unless the weed use is causing harm or visible illegal activity, the driver might be overstepping. The driver's situation is tough, but using a legal report as a tool to pressure the customer into tipping could be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the driver is in the wrong) because their main grievance is about tips, and using a legal report for that could be ethically problematic. However, if the weed use is indeed illegal and observable, then technically they're not in the wrong. But since the driver's primary motive is financial, it's a gray area. I think the community might lean towards the driver being in the wrong because it's using a legal system for personal gain rather than public safety.\n"
