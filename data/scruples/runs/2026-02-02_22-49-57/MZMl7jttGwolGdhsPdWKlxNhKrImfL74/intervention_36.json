Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a delivery driver who's been delivering to someone who hasn't tipped them four times. Each time, the customer is stoned and smells strongly of weed. The author mentions that they don't have a problem with weed personally, but it's illegal in their area. The customer is one of their farthest deliveries, so the author actually loses money on each trip. The customer intentionally puts $0.00 in the tip section, not that they forget. The author is making $5 an hour and relies on tips, so this is affecting their income.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they report the customer for smoking weed. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is a delivery driver, and their job is to deliver the product. The customer's actions (smoking weed) are their own business, even if illegal. However, the author might feel justified in reporting because they believe it's against the law. But is it their place to do so just because they're a delivery person? Also, the main issue seems to be the lack of tips, which is affecting their income. They might be using the weed as a reason to report the customer, but is that the right motivation?\n\nOn the other hand, the customer's actions might not be directly related to the delivery. Unless there's a specific policy from the pizza place about reporting illegal activities, the author's role might not include that. Also, the author is using their position to report someone for something that's a personal choice (even if illegal), which could be seen as overstepping. The author's primary responsibility is to deliver food, not to enforce laws they perceive are being broken.\n\nAnother angle is the customer not tipping. That's a separate issue. The author could address that by not delivering as efficiently or maybe talking to the customer, but reporting for a legal matter might be conflating two different issues. The author's motivation might be more about the lost tips than the actual illegal activity, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, laws vary. If weed is illegal in their area, then technically, the customer is breaking the law. But the author is a private citizen, not law enforcement. Should they be the one to report someone based on a suspicion? Especially if they can't be sure that the customer is in violation of specific laws. Maybe the smell of weed isn't enough evidence, and the author isn't in a position to police the customer's actions.\n\nMoreover, the ethical aspect: is it right to report someone for a personal reason (not getting tipped)? That could be seen as using a law enforcement action as a form of revenge or retaliation for not receiving tips, which is a business aspect. That might make the author look inconsiderate of their customer's rights.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions could be seen as using a legal justification to address a personal grievance about not receiving tips. That would place them in the wrong because they're misusing their position to report someone for a reason unrelated to their job duties. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
