Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who wants to report a customer for smoking weed because the customer doesn't tip and the driver thinks it's illegal. They want to know if they're in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to check the legality of weed in their area. If it's illegal, then reporting someone for using it could be justified. But even if it is illegal, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Their main role is delivering pizza, not enforcing laws. \n\nThe customer isn't tipping, which is affecting the driver's income. But is that a valid reason to report them? The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 intentionally, so it's not a mistake. However, the driver's motivation might be financial rather than upholding the law. \n\nThere's a potential conflict of interest here. The driver is using their position to target someone they have a personal grievance with. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver isn't in a position to enforce it. The police should handle such reports, but the driver might not have a duty to report unless it's a serious crime affecting others. \n\nAlso, the driver's statement about losing money on the delivery adds another layer. They might feel hard done by, but that doesn't necessarily justify reporting for a personal gain. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed breaking the law, then the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction's laws and the driver's intent.\n\nBut considering the context, the driver is using their job to report a customer for personal reasons. That could be seen as misuse of their position. So, even if the customer is doing something illegal, the driver's intent here is to get a tip, which complicates things. \n\nIn many places, citizens can report crimes, but doing so for personal gain is ethically questionable. The driver might be considered a \"snitch\" for financial motives, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they are misusing their role and the reporting process for personal reasons, not genuine law enforcement concerns.\n"
