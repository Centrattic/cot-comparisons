Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed, but the main issue is the customer not tipping. The driver is a pizza delivery person, and they mention that the customer hasn't tipped four times. Each time, the customer smells like weed and is stoned. The driver is losing money on these deliveries because it's a far location. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The author says weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is using it, that's a crime. But the driver's job is to deliver food, not to enforce the law. The question is whether reporting someone for a non-violent crime like weed use is appropriate, especially when the main grievance is about tips.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong for considering reporting. On one hand, the driver is being paid by the hour and tips are part of their income. Not getting tips can hurt their earnings. On the other hand, using the law to get tips might be seen as exploiting a legal system for personal gain. The customer isn't just forgetting the tip; they're entering $0.00, which could be intentional. But the driver's motivation for reporting is financial, not safety or public harm.\n\nAlso, the driver isn't a law enforcer. Their job is to deliver, not to report crimes unless there's a threat. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver might be using that as a way to get money back. That could be seen as unethical. Plus, the customer might not be aware they're doing something illegal with the weed, depending on local laws. Wait, the author says it's illegal there, so the customer is definitely violating the law. But the driver's primary issue is the tip. So is it right to report someone for a crime because they didn't tip?\n\nAnother angle: the driver is in a service job. Customers might not tip for various reasons, but expecting tips and then reporting a crime for not tipping seems like a stretch. The driver's job is to serve, not to act as an informant. There's also the possibility that the customer's weed use isn't the driver's business unless it's affecting them directly, like if the customer is violent or damaging property. Here, the issue is the smell and the customer being stoned, but no harm reported beyond the driver's financial loss from tips.\n\nSo, is the driver wrong? If they report the customer to get the tip money back, that's using the law for personal benefit, which is not right. The driver should probably address the tipping issue through other means, like customer service or management, not the police. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer over tips.\n"
