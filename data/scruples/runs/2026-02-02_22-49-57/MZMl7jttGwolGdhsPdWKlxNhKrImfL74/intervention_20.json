Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed. The key points here are that the customer hasn't tipped multiple times, the driver smells weed on them, and the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section. The driver lives in a place where weed is illegal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If the customer is smoking weed, and it's against the law, then maybe the driver isn't wrong to report them. But wait, maybe the driver is overstepping by reporting someone for a personal activity. Even though it's illegal, maybe the driver isn't a police officer, so they shouldn't be the ones to report unless they witness a crime. But the customer is in their home, so unless the driver has proof that they're smoking in a public place or violating specific laws beyond just possession, maybe the driver doesn't have a solid case. \n\nAlso, the tip issue. The customer isn't tipping, but is that a justification for reporting them? The driver is upset because they're losing money on the delivery. However, the tips are the customer's choice, and while the customer's behavior of writing $0 might be rude, it's not illegal. So the driver's motivation might be financial rather than purely about enforcing the law. \n\nAnother angle: the driver is using the customer's weed use as an excuse to report them because of the lack of tips. That could be seen as taking advantage of the situation for personal gain. The driver's responsibility is to deliver the pizza, not to police their customers. \n\nBut the driver might argue that they're just doing their job by reporting a potential crime. However, if the customer is home and smoking in private, it's not a public nuisance. The driver isn't in a position to enforce that. Unless they have evidence of other illegal activities beyond just smoking, the report might not be valid. \n\nSo, the driver's intent here is a mix of legal and personal. The main issue is whether the customer is actually breaking the law in a way that the driver can report. If the customer is in their own home, it's hard to report them for that. Therefore, the driver might be using the weed as a reason to retaliate against not getting tips. That would make the driver in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is smoking in a place where it's prohibited, like in public or in a car, then it's different. But based on the info given, the customer is in their home. So the driver's action is not justified. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
