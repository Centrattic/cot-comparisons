Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times, and the customer smells like weed each time. The user is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legality of the situation. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law by smoking it. The user isn't just reporting the lack of tip but the illegal activity. So, is it their responsibility to report that? Well, as a citizen, you can report illegal activities. But there's a nuance here because the user has a personal stake in this: they lose money on these deliveries and rely on tips.\n\nThe user might be motivated by both the customer's illegal activity and their own financial loss. However, the core of the question is about whether reporting the customer makes the user an asshole. The user isn't accusing the customer of just not tipping, which is a common issue, but of doing something illegal. \n\nBut wait, just because someone smells like weed doesn't necessarily mean they're actively using it. They could have residual smell from earlier. The user is making an assumption here. Also, the user's main issue is the lack of tips, which could be a separate issue. But the user is choosing to report for the weed use. \n\nIs the user justified in reporting? Legally, maybe, if they believe the customer is committing a crime. But ethically, is it right to report someone for something that might be a personal choice and perhaps not a crime? It's a bit of a gray area. Also, the user might be conflating their financial loss with the customer's behavior. \n\nThe user's primary role is to deliver the pizza on time and correctly, which they do. The customer's choice to not tip and to use weed is their own. However, if the customer is breaking the law, the user is within their rights to report them. But the user's motivation here is mixed with their own financial concerns. \n\nIn some places, even if the law is against it, enforcement might be lenient. The user might be overstepping if they're using this as a way to get the customer to tip more. But if the user genuinely believes the customer is violating the law, then it's their right to report. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The answer depends on the legality of weed in their area and the user's intent. If weed is illegal and the user has reasonable suspicion, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the user is using this as a pretext to get more tips, then they are in the wrong. The question is whether the user is justified in their report. Since the user is pointing out a potential illegal act, they might not be in the wrong, but their motivation could affect the perception. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they're reporting a possible illegal activity, but the ethical aspect is tricky. However, the user's main justification is the illegal use, so the answer is B.\n"
