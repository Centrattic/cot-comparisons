Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips multiple times from a customer. The customer smells like weed each time, and the driver is considering reporting them for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver mentions that the customer intentionally writes $0.00 in the tip, and since the delivery is far, the driver actually loses money each time. The driver's pay is $5/hour, so they rely on tips to make a living.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. The customer is using weed, which is illegal in their location. The driver is thinking of reporting them. But is it the driver's place to report someone for a personal activity, even if it's illegal? There's a difference between witnessing a crime and using it as a means for personal gain. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips and the financial loss from delivering to a far location. The mention of weed might be a way to justify reporting the customer to get them to stop ordering, thus avoiding the loss, and possibly getting them in trouble.\n\nBut then, the driver's motivation here seems to be about the tips and the financial impact. Reporting someone for a drug-related offense should be based on actual criminal activity witnessed, not as a way to retaliate for not getting tips. The customer's use of weed might be a private matter, and unless the driver is directly involved in a crime (like delivering to an illegal activity), it's not their responsibility to police others. \n\nAlso, the driver is in a position of service. Using their role to report a customer for something that's primarily a personal choice (even if it's illegal) to get them to tip more or stop using the service could be seen as using the law for personal benefit. That might be considered unethical or even an abuse of their position. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer is indeed breaking the law if weed is illegal there. But the driver isn't law enforcement, so their role is to provide a service, not to enforce laws. They should report crimes when they observe them, but if the primary motive is personal gain (in this case, tips), it's a conflict of interest. \n\nSo, the author is considering reporting the customer not because of the weed use itself, but because the customer isn't tipping. The weed is a possible reason, but the main issue is the lack of tips. Therefore, using the weed as an excuse to report the customer might be the wrong thing to do. The driver should instead address the tipping issue directly, maybe by talking to the customer or the employer, but not by involving the police over a legal matter that isn't directly related to their job duties. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are using a legal issue as a means to retaliate against a customer for not tipping, which is a personal financial issue. Reporting the customer in this context is inappropriate and unethical.\n"
