Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The delivery driver is asking if they're an asshole (WIBTA) for reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is caught smoking weed. The key points here are the legal status of weed in their area, the customer's consistent failure to tip, and the financial impact on the driver.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if weed is illegal where they are, then using it is a crime. Reporting someone for illegal activity is generally within a person's rights. It's not about personal judgment but about following the law. The driver isn't making a moral accusation but pointing out a legal violation.\n\nNext, the tipping issue. The customer deliberately enters $0.00 each time, which is different from forgetting. The driver relies on tips for income, especially since they're paid $5 an hour, which is below minimum wage in many places. The customer's choice to not tip, even when high, affects the driver's earnings. However, the customer's right to choose not to tip exists, but it's separate from the weed use.\n\nThe driver's motivation here is a bit of a mix. They mention losing money on each delivery, which adds to their financial stress. Reporting someone for weed use could be seen as using a legal issue to address a personal financial grievance. That might raise questions about their intent. Are they genuinely reporting a crime, or are they trying to get back at someone for not tipping?\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, the act of reporting a suspected crime is protected. However, if the driver's primary motive is to retaliate for unpaid tips, it could be seen as an abusive use of reporting power. The line between a legitimate report and a vendetta is thin here. The customer's behavior is illegal, but the driver's financial loss from the tips is a separate issue. \n\nIn terms of moral rightness, the driver might feel justified because they're upholding the law. However, others might argue that using a legal system to target someone for not tipping is taking it too far. The driver's reliance on tips is a valid concern, but it's a workplace issue that might be better addressed through employer channels or customer service rather than law enforcement.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the driver is within their legal rights to report the customer for illegal weed use. However, the context of their financial loss from untipped deliveries might make their decision seem like an overreach or misuse of the reporting system. The primary wrong here isn't in the act of reporting a crime, but possibly in using that opportunity to retaliate for unpaid tips. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if the intent is more about retaliation than genuine legal compliance.\n"
