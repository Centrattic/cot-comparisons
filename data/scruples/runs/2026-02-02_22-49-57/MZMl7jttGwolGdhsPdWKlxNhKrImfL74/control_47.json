Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped and is smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The driver mentions that the customer hasn't tipped four times, each time smells like weed, and the customer writes $0.00 in the tip. The driver relies on tips since they make $5 an hour. The area where they live considers weed illegal. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer. The question is if the driver is in the wrong. So, the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. Legally, if weed is illegal, the driver could report the customer for using an illegal substance. However, the driver's main grievance is about the tips. They're not getting paid, which affects their income. But is using that as a reason to report the customer for something else (weed use) ethical?\n\nOn one hand, the driver might be using the weed as an excuse to retaliate against the customer for not tipping. That could be seen as a misuse of the reporting system. On the other hand, if the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, they might not be wrong. But the driver's main motivation here seems to be about the tips. \n\nAlso, the driver mentions they lose money on each delivery because it's a far delivery. So maybe the driver is frustrated and using the weed as a reason to report the customer. But if the customer is actually breaking the law, the driver is within their rights to report. However, if the driver's primary motive is revenge for no tips, that's unethical. \n\nThe key points are the legality of the customer's actions and the driver's intent. If the driver is truthful about the customer's weed use, they're not wrong. But if they're lying to get back at the customer for not tipping, that's wrong. The user says the customer is \"stoned and just smells like straight weed,\" which the driver might be reporting as a fact. \n\nHowever, the driver might also be overstepping by using their own judgment to enforce laws, especially if they're not in a position to do so. Also, the driver's job is to deliver food, not to police customers. Reporting someone for personal financial reasons could be seen as a misuse of authority. \n\nIn many places, citizens can report illegal activities, but the ethics depend on the intent. If the driver is genuinely concerned about the law being broken, it's okay. But if it's retaliation, then it's wrong. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00, not forgetting, so the driver knows the customer is intentional. But using that as a reason to report for weed use might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, considering all this, the driver might be in the wrong if their main motivation is revenge for the tips rather than a genuine legal concern. But if they are accurately reporting illegal activity, they might not be wrong. However, the scenario suggests that the driver is using the weed as a reason to report the customer for not tipping, which could be unethical. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the driver is using the illegality of weed as a means to retaliate against the customer for not tipping, which is not a justifiable reason to report someone to the police. The driver's primary issue is financial, and using the law to settle a personal dispute is inappropriate.\n"
