Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong if they report a customer for smoking weed, based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is observed to be stoned and has the smell of weed. The author mentions that weed is illegal in their area. They lose money on each delivery to this customer, and the customer intentionally leaves a $0 tip. The author is considering reporting the customer to the police and wants to know if that makes them an asshole (i.e., in the wrong).\n\nSo, the key points here: legality of weed in the location, the author's financial motivation for reporting, and the ethics of using a personal grievance (lack of tips) as a reason to report someone for an illegal activity.\n\nLegally, if weed is indeed illegal where they are, then the act of smoking it is against the law. However, the author is not a law enforcement officer. Their role is to deliver pizza. Reporting a customer could be seen as overstepping their role if it's done for personal gain (i.e., trying to get the customer in trouble to get a tip). \n\nEthically, the question is whether using the customer's illegal activity as a means to get a tip is justified. Even if the act is illegal, the author's primary job is to deliver the pizza, and the tip is a separate matter. However, if the customer is committing a crime, the author has a responsibility to report it, but the motivation here seems mixed. The author states they are not against weed personally, just noting it's illegal, so maybe they are conflicted. But their main grievance is the lack of tips and the financial loss from the far delivery.\n\nThere's a possible conflict of interest here. If the author reports the customer solely because they didn't tip, that could be seen as using a legal issue for a personal financial motive. On the other hand, if the author genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law, they might feel obligated to report it regardless of the tip. But the customer's actions (smoking weed) and the lack of tipping are separate issues. The author can't force the customer to tip, and using that as a reason to report them might be unethical. \n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, citizens can report suspected illegal activities, but if it's done with ulterior motives, it might not be appropriate. The question is whether the author's primary motivation is to get a tip or to uphold the law. If it's the former, then it's likely they are in the wrong. If it's the latter, maybe not. However, the author's own stance is that they personally don't have a problem with weed, which might indicate that their main issue is the lack of tip, not the illegal activity itself.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's main motive seems to be financial (since the customer is costing them money and not tipping), and using the illegal activity as a reason to report them would be using a legal matter for personal gain. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
