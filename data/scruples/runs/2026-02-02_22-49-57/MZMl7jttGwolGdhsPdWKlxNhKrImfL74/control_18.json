Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: they're a pizza delivery driver. A customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time the customer was smoking weed and smelt like it. The author is considering reporting the customer to the police because weed is illegal where they live. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting, and that they lose money on each delivery to this person. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author is justified in reporting. The key points are legality of weed, the customer's actions, and the author's motivation.\n\nIn the US, marijuana's legality depends on the state. If it's illegal in their area, then the customer using it could be a violation. But the author is a delivery driver, so their job is to deliver food. Their role doesn't typically involve enforcing laws unless they're a law enforcement officer. So, maybe the author isn't the right person to report, even if the customer is doing something illegal. Also, the customer might not be breaking the law if it's legal in their state. Wait, the author says it's illegal where they live, so that part is clear.\n\nBut then, the author's main issue is the lack of tips. They might be upset because the customer is not tipping, and they're losing money on each delivery. The question is whether reporting the customer for a legal violation is justified when the main issue is the tip. So, is the author using the weed as an excuse to retaliate for not getting tips?\n\nThere's a difference between observing a potential illegal act and using that as a pretext for a personal grievance. If the author's main motivation is the lack of tips and the financial loss, then they might be using the weed as a reason to get back at the customer, which could be considered wrong. Because it's a form of snitching for personal gain rather than genuine concern for the law. Even if the customer is doing something illegal, the author's intent here is more about getting revenge or seeking payment they believe they're owed, which could make their action unethical or \"asshole\" behavior as per the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...).\n\nAlso, the customer might be aware that the author is a delivery person and could be retaliating. So the author's action might be seen as using a legal violation to settle a personal score. Unless the author is reporting because they genuinely believe the law is being broken, but their primary motivation is different, then that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: if the customer is smoking weed in their home, even if it's illegal, it's a private matter. Unless the author has evidence that the customer is using in a public place or selling, but the description says \"smells like straight weed\" when delivered, which might imply it's being used in the home. So maybe the customer is violating the law by using in a place where it's not allowed, but the author isn't in a position to enforce that.\n\nIn many places, citizens can report suspected illegal activities, so technically they aren't breaking the law by doing so. But the ethics depend on the reason. If the author is doing it out of spite or to get money, that's a different story.\n\nSo the answer depends on whether the primary motivation is ethical. The author is considering reporting a legal violation to punish someone for not tipping. That seems like a misuse of the legal system for personal gain, making them an asshole. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
