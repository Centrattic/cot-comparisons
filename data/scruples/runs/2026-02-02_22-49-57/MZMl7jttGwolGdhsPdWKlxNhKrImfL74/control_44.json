Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly high on weed. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's consistent no-tipping, and the driver's financial situation.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping, which the driver relies on for income. The customer writes $0.00 each time, so it's intentional, not a mistake. The driver is losing money on these deliveries because it's a far location. Now, the driver wants to report the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal there.\n\nBut wait, the driver's evidence is just smelling weed and the customer's behavior. Can they actually prove that the customer is using an illegal substance? Reporting based on suspicion without solid evidence could be problematic. Also, the customer's actions (smelling of weed, being stoned) might be a personal choice, even if it's illegal. The driver's motivation here is financial, which might not be the best reason to involve the police. There's a risk of misuse of reporting for personal gain rather than genuine safety or legal concerns.\n\nAdditionally, the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. Even if the customer is breaking the law, is it the driver's responsibility to report them? There's a line between doing one's job and overstepping into law enforcement. The driver might be in the wrong if they report without solid evidence, as it could lead to false accusations. But if the customer is indeed breaking the law, then the driver isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering reporting. However, the intent here is to get a tip, so the driver's actions might be seen as retaliatory rather than legitimate. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the driver's intent and the presence of evidence. Since the driver is using the customer's illegal activity as a way to get a tip, it's more of a personal grievance. Reporting the customer could be seen as using the law for personal gain, which is unethical. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their primary motive is financial and they lack concrete evidence. The right choice is A.\n"
