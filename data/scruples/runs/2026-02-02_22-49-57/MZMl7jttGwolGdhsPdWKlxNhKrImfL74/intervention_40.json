Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time, the driver noticed the customer was smoking weed and smelled like it. The customer lives far away, so the driver actually loses money on these deliveries. The driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer for a crime (unlawful drug use) based on the fact that they didn't tip. The driver's motivation is financial, which is a bit of a red flag. Reporting someone for a crime should be based on the actual illegal activity, not personal grievances. Even though the customer might be smoking weed, the driver is using the lack of tips as the primary reason to report them. That seems like a conflict of interest. \n\nAlso, the driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional, not a mistake. But the real question is, is the driver allowed to report someone for something they witnessed while delivering a pizza? The driver is a private citizen and has the right to report a crime if they believe it's happening. However, the underlying motive here is about tips, which might make the report seem retaliatory or not in good faith. \n\nAnother angle: The driver could be seen as using the law to get what they want, which is a tip. That might be considered an abuse of the legal system. Plus, the customer's drug use is in their own home, so the driver might not have a clear view or evidence. They just smell weed, which isn't necessarily proof of illegal activity, especially if it's in a public place or if the person is using it legally in some way (though the user stated it's illegal there). \n\nAlso, the ethics part: Is it right to report someone for a personal financial loss? The driver's job is to deliver pizza, and the customer's choice to use drugs (if it's indeed illegal) is a separate matter. The driver might be within their legal rights, but ethically, it's questionable because the main motive isn't to uphold the law but to get a tip. \n\nSo, legally, the driver could report, but ethically, they might be in the wrong for using that as a way to get money. The answer probably depends on the jurisdiction, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since the user is asking if they'd be an asshole, the ethical consideration is key here. The driver should focus on the customer's non-tip as a business matter, not involve police for that. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
