My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they thought of each other. The situation involves debate team politics and a possible co-captain election.\n\nFirst, the author is on the debate team and wants to run with their partner Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary don't actually like each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them the other's negative thoughts, leading to a breakup in front of everyone, with James crying. Others on the team think the author did a favor.\n\nHmm. So the key question is whether it's right to intervene in a relationship by revealing private thoughts. The author's intention was to help, thinking the couple was incompatible and that breaking up would be better for them. But did they overstep?\n\nOn one hand, the author wasn't friends with either and had no right to meddle in their relationship. Spreading negative info could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's true. Relationships are complex, and people might stay together for various reasons beyond just debate. The author's action caused public embarrassment and emotional pain, which is serious.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons, maybe the author helped them realize the truth. Others agreed it was a favor. But relationships are personal, and the author isn't a mediator here. Even if the motives were good, the method might be wrong. Telling someone how the other views them without consent could be seen as a violation of privacy.\n\nI think the line between helping and interfering is thin. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by promoting honesty, but relationships require communication between the involved parties, not third-party interference. So even if the outcome was positive, the action could be considered wrong because it wasn't their place to act as a middleman. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But others might say the result was good, so the author isn't (B). \n\nBut considering the emotional impact on James and the fact that relationships should be handled by the people in them, I lean towards A. The author shouldn't have acted as a go-between. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role isn't to solve that.\n"
