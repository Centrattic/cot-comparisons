My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The person is part of a debate team and is running for co-captain with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other very much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting, and James is upset, but others think the author was helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't ask for this information but overheard or knew through casual talks. They then decided to meddle in their relationship, which caused a public breakup. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's action might be seen as crossing a line. Relationships are personal, and sharing negative thoughts without consent can harm trust and respect. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the couple was already on shaky ground and the author helped them realize their incompatibility. But intentionally breaking up a couple, even if they're unhappy, isn't typically considered ethical. The author's motive was probably to eliminate competition, which adds a layer of manipulation. The key point here is whether the author acted in the couple's best interest or their own. If the author's main goal was to sabotage the competition, then it's more about self-interest rather than genuine concern. \n\nAlso, the public breakup caused emotional distress to James, who was crying. That's a sign of significant impact, and the author should consider the consequences of their actions. Even if others agreed they were a bad match, the method of revealing the information was abrupt and hurtful. The author might have thought they were doing a favor, but the intent and the way it was done matter. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have approached the couple privately to discuss their concerns instead of airing it in front of others. They didn't give the couple a chance to address the issues themselves. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, was invasive and caused immediate harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
