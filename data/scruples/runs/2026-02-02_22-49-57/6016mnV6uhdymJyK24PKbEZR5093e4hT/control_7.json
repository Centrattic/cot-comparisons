My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple, Tim and Mary, by telling them what they thought of each other. The situation is within a high school debate team where they're competing for co-captain positions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is on the debate team and working with Tim. They anticipate competition from James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but are staying together because they need to be partners for debate. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and the motivation behind the author's actions. Did the author have the right to disclose what each person thought of the other? The author might have believed that ending their forced relationship was beneficial, but relationships are personal, and intervening without permission can be problematic.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help them be honest and end an unhappy partnership, which might be seen as doing the right thing for their well-being. The outcome was that they broke up, and others on the team agreed it was a favor. However, causing a public argument and a breakup, especially when both parties were already unhappy, could be seen as crossing a line. The author didn't ask for permission to meddle in their relationship, which is private. Even if the result was positive, the method might be unethical because it's not their place to decide others' relationships.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, is significant. While others agreed with the action, it's possible that the author's role as a mediator was overstepping. The ethical dilemma here is between well-intentioned interference versus respecting personal boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the outcome was beneficial, the act of interjecting without consent can be considered wrong. The author might not be entirely at fault, but the method of intervention is questionable. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because they shouldn't have done it. If B (No), it's because the intention was good and the result was positive. Different perspectives here. But generally, meddling without consent is seen as wrong, hence the answer might be A.\n"
