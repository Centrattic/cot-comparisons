My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did something wrong by breaking up a couple by telling them what they thought of each other. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary come from different social groups and aren't actually happy in their relationship but stay together because of debate. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author helped.\n\nNow, the key factors here: the author's intention was to help them break up because they were incompatible. But is it right to meddle in someone else's relationship? Even if the couple was unhappy, the author wasn't their friend and had a personal motive (competition for co-captains). Did the author overstep by spreading the information they had?\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're doing the right thing by freeing James and Mary from an unhappy situation. Others on the team agreed. On the other hand, relationships are personal, and the author's actions could be seen as interfering without consent. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method of using the information could be harsh. Also, the author had a personal stake in the outcome, which might make it more about their own interests rather than genuine concern.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, honesty is important, but the way it's delivered matters. If the author had encouraged them to talk to each other, that's different. But directly telling each other negative opinions without their consent might be crossing a line. The author used the information to break up the partnership, possibly manipulating the situation for their own benefit. That could be seen as unethical, even if the outcome was positive for the couple.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship for strategic reasons, even if the result was the couple's happiness. The intent might be good, but the method was inappropriate.\n"
