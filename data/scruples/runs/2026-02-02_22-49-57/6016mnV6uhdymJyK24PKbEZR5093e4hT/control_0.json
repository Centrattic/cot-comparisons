My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a debate team where the author broke up a couple, James and Mary, by telling them what the other thought of them. The author's motivation was to prevent them from being in a bad relationship just because of their debate partnership.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author wasn't friends with either of them but overheard or knew their negative opinions. They decided to share those opinions, which led to a breakup. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor because the couple was incompatible.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, honesty can be seen as a virtue, but revealing someone's negative thoughts without permission might be a privacy violation. The author didn't ask for permission, so that's a problem. Also, the couple might not have wanted their private feelings aired publicly. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help them realize they weren't compatible. The outcome was a breakup that both were unhappy about, but maybe it saved them from a longer, forced relationship. The debate team's politics and competition are also part of the context. \n\nBut then, even if the intention was good, the method was to spread the negative opinions. Did the author have the right to do that? Relationships are personal, and while the couple was using the partnership as a reason to stay together, the author's interference might have crossed a line. \n\nAlso, James was crying and blamed the author. Emotional harm is a factor here. Even if others agreed, the author's actions directly caused the breakup. It's possible that the couple could have ended things themselves without the author's intervention. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they acted as a mediator without being asked. They could have handled it differently, like advising each person to talk to the other instead of revealing their thoughts. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they violated the couple's privacy and acted without consent, even if the intention was good.\n"
