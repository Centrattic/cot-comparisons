My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. They're on the debate team and want to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James sees Mary as too idealistic and boring, and Mary sees James as a big mouth with a small brain. So they told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider if it's the author's place to do that. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, it's usually not someone else's job to intervene unless they're directly involved. But the author isn't friends with them, just knows them through debate. They might have had their own motives, maybe to undermine the competition for the co-captain position. That could be a conflict of interest here. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the couple stayed together because of their debate partnership. So maybe they weren't happy but were staying together for the sake of their shared goal. The author's action might have been out of self-interest, wanting to eliminate the competition, and then justified it by saying they were doing the couple a favor. \n\nBut others on the team agreed that the author was right because the couple was incompatible. However, even if that's true, the method of intervention is questionable. Telling each person negative things about their partner without their consent is a breach of trust and could be seen as manipulative. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the action had a negative emotional impact, even if the outcome was a breakup.\n\nI need to weigh the intent against the action. The author's intent might have been to help the couple realize their incompatibility, but the means of doing so were deceitful. Spreading such information without the couple's knowledge is a violation of privacy and trust. Even if the outcome is positive, the method might still be considered wrong. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the debate team, the author might have had ulterior motives related to their own goals for co-captain, which complicates things further. It's possible that the author's action was more about their own interests than genuinely helping the couple. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The couple might have needed to address their issues themselves. The author stepping in to relay negative opinions could have prevented the couple from handling their own issues, leading to an abrupt and public breakup that hurt James. \n\nSo, while the outcome might have seemed beneficial to others, the action itself was a breach of trust and could be considered interfering in a way that's not appropriate. Therefore, the author might be at fault for overstepping their role and causing harm through their intervention.\n"
