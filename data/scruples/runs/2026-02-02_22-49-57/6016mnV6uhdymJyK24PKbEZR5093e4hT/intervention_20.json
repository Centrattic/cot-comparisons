My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The scenario is set in a high school debate team. The author, part of the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy with each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an emotional argument.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author did the right thing. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they want to win the co-captain election. Their competition is James and Mary. By breaking up the couple, the author might be trying to remove a strong opponent. But the author claims they did it because they thought the couple was incompatible and being unhappy due to staying together for debate. Others on the team agreed that the author did a favor.\n\nBut wait, is it ethical to meddle in someone else's relationship, even if the intention is good? The author didn't ask for permission to be a mediator. They took it upon themselves to intervene. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method of intervention\u2014spilling the beans about each other's negative thoughts\u2014seems invasive. Relationships are complex, and while the couple might be unhappy, it's not for someone else to decide they should break up. The author's actions led to a public breakup and emotional distress, which is a heavy consequence.\n\nHowever, the alternative is that the couple was in a harmful situation, keeping up a facade for their partnership. If the author's action led to them both being happier in the long run, maybe their intention was to help. But crossing into personal relationships to benefit one's own goals (winning the election) muddies the waters. There's a conflict of interest here. The author might have used the couple's personal issues as a strategy to gain an advantage in the election.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely believed they were helping and the outcome was positive (others agree), does that justify the means? But the method was direct\u2014telling each other their negative thoughts without their consent. It's a breach of privacy and trust. Even if the result was good, the action was a violation of personal boundaries. So, from an ethical standpoint, the action is questionable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the ends justify the means. If the author's intention was to help the couple, but the method was inappropriate, then maybe they are partially at fault. If the intention was to sabotage the competition, then it's more clearly wrong. The author's dual motive (helping the couple and gaining an election advantage) complicates this. The fact that the action had a negative impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, suggests harm was caused. The team agreed it was a favor, but others' opinions might be biased or not consider the personal impact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been positive for the couple's long-term happiness, the author's direct intervention without consent and with a self-serving motive likely makes them at fault. The correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
