My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone on the debate team who broke up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The author's partner, Tim, is the better debater, but they think they can win against another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are whether the author had the right to intervene. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship, which was being sustained only because of their debate partnership. But did they have the right to act as a matchmaker or to meddle in their personal lives? \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were doing the right thing by freeing the couple from an unhappy situation. The story mentions that the couple was incompatible but stayed together for debate, which caused them unhappiness. Others on the team agreed it was a favor, so maybe the author's action had some support. However, relationships are personal, and even if the author knew the couple's feelings, was it their responsibility to act on that information? \n\nOn the other hand, telling someone what their partner thinks without permission is a breach of trust. The author didn't ask for consent, nor did they consider the emotional impact. James was crying and blamed the author, indicating that the action was hurtful. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the method of intervention might be questionable. The author's motivation was to help the debate team's chances, which seems self-serving. Maybe their real intent was to eliminate competition rather than genuinely help the couple. \n\nAlso, the story mentions that the author is part of a similar partnership with Tim. If they were in the same situation, would they want someone to interfere? It's possible that the author overstepped by using their knowledge of the couple's private feelings to manipulate the situation for their benefit. \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is about respecting others' privacy versus trying to help. Even if the outcome was positive, the means used were intrusive. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was pure, but the method and lack of consent could make them responsible. However, others might argue that the couple was better off ended, so the author did a good deed. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were justified by the positive outcome. But in terms of right and wrong, intervening without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for meddled in the couple's relationship without their permission, even if the result was a breakup.\n"
