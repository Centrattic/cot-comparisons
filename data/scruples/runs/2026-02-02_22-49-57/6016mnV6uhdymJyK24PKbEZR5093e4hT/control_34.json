My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's negative opinions. So, the scenario is that Tim and the narrator are planning to run for co-captains against James and Mary, who are a couple from different social groups. The author finds out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup and an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Is it the author's place to meddle in someone else's relationship? Even if the couple is unhappy, does that justify intervening? The author's motivation is to help them by ending an unhappy relationship, but relationships are complex, and people might have their reasons for staying together beyond just surface reasons. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're doing a favor by ending a bad relationship that's causing unhappiness. The other side is that the author didn't have the couple's consent to act as a mediator. Relationships are personal, and sharing others' negative opinions without their permission can be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the method could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the context of competition might add another layer. The author might have felt that breaking up the couple would help their chances as co-captains. But the story says they didn't want to break up because it would affect their debate partnership. So maybe the author didn't intend to interfere for personal gain, but the action still had ulterior motives, which complicates things.\n\nJames was crying and blamed the author, which shows emotional harm was done. While others agreed it was a favor, the author's action led to an argument in public and a breakup. The question is whether causing this outcome makes the author at fault. \n\nThere's a difference between giving advice and actively causing a breakup. The author didn't just talk to them but revealed what they thought the other thought, which could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method of intervention was aggressive and public, which might not be appropriate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intention might have been good, but the action was intrusive. The fact that the couple was already in a partnership (both romantic and debate) suggests that staying together for the partnership is a valid reason, even if they aren't happy. The author's role as a debater might involve strategy, but manipulating personal relationships crosses a line. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal matter without consent, leading to emotional distress, even if the outcome was positive for the couple's individual happiness. The answer would lean towards A (author at fault) because they didn't have the right to act as a matchmaker or mediator without being asked.\n"
