My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person writing is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The situation is that they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competitors are a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was it right to meddle in their relationship? The author's motivation was to eliminate competition for the co-captains position. Even if they claim it was because they thought the couple was unhappy and incompatible, there's a conflict of interest here. The author's actions directly benefit their own goals but at the expense of the couple's personal lives. \n\nThen there's the issue of trust and boundaries. The author wasn't friends with either James or Mary, but they overheard or learned their private feelings. Sharing that information is a breach of confidentiality. Even if the information is true, spreading it without consent can be harmful. Relationships are complex, and breaking them up based on one person's interpretation might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the author might be projecting their own situation onto James and Mary. They mention that they and their partner were friends before debate, which might make them assume that the couple's partnership isn't genuine. But James and Mary might have reasons to stay together beyond just debate, like emotional reasons or fear of conflict. The author's actions led to a public argument and James crying, which shows the emotional toll.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they were doing a favor by ending a toxic or unhappy relationship. The team members agreed with the author, saying they were a better match. However, the author's primary motive was strategic\u2014getting co-captain positions\u2014so their actions might be seen as self-serving. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were questionable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the couple themselves were the ones in the relationship. They knew each other's feelings but didn't act on them. The author didn't have to step in unless there was consent. The fact that James blamed the author suggests that the author's role was inappropriate, even if others approved. The key here is the lack of consent and the intent to manipulate the situation for personal gain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they crossed a boundary, used private information without permission, and their actions were motivated by self-interest rather than genuine concern for the couple's well-being.\n"
