My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their true feelings. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is on the debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author overheard that James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but stay together for debate. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to a breakup during a debate meeting. James blames the author, but others think it was a favor.\n\nSo, the key points are: The author acted out of self-interest (competing for co-captain) but also saw an opportunity to disrupt the competition by causing a breakup. The author's actions were based on overheard or assumed information about the couple's incompatibility. \n\nNow, the ethical dilemma: Is it right to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if you believe it's for their benefit? The author's intent was to eliminate competition, which is a conflict of interest. Even if the breakup was inevitable, the author's role in causing it might be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, trust and honesty are important. However, the author didn't have a duty to intervene. They used the information to serve their own goals. While the couple might have been unhappy, the author's method was manipulative. Breaking up a couple, even if they're unhappy, is a significant action that can have lasting emotional effects, as seen with James crying. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the couple wasn't happy and the author helped them realize the truth. But the author's primary motivation was their own benefit, not the couple's well-being. The line between helping and interfering is thin here. \n\nSo, the author's actions were self-serving and involved meddling in others' personal lives. Even though others agreed it was a favor, the intent and method matter. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they used the couple's personal issues to gain an advantage, leading to their breakup.\n"
