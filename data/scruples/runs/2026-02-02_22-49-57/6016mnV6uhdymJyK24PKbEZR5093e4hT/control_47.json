My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't really happy with each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the author. Others thought the author did them a favor.\n\nHmm. The key question is whether the author crossed a line by revealing these thoughts. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the author is part of the debate team and likely in a competitive situation. They might feel that breaking up the couple would weaken their competition. But is that a valid reason? Maybe, but the ethical question is about the method. Did they have the right to meddle in their relationship? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is unhappy, it's their choice how to handle it. The author's intervention led to a public breakup and emotional distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might have stayed together for the wrong reasons, and the author believed they were helping. But is it their place to do so? Even if they meant well, did they respect the couple's privacy? Telling each other about their private criticisms could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The author might have acted out of self-interest to reduce competition, which complicates the matter. \n\nBut others on the team agreed it was a favor, so maybe there's a team dynamic where this kind of honesty is valued. However, causing a public breakup during a meeting where someone is crying is a significant consequence. The author might not have considered the emotional impact or sought the couple's consent to share such information. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respecting boundaries. If the author had approached the couple to help them work things out instead of directly revealing the criticisms, that might be a more constructive approach. But as it stands, the direct revelation led to immediate fallout. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author had a motive (reducing competition) and used a method that caused emotional harm without considering the couple's autonomy. That suggests they might be in the wrong. But if the team culture supports such actions, maybe not. However, generally, interfering in someone else's relationship like that is crossing a line. So the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
