My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're part of a debate team, and they wanted to become co-captains. Their partner, Tim, is a better debater, but the author is better at politics. The main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other very much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which caused them to break up during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the author. Others on the team thought the author was doing them a favor because the couple was incompatible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author didn't ask for permission to share these thoughts, they just relayed what they thought each person thought of the other. Even if the author's information was accurate, intervening in someone's relationship without their consent can be problematic. Relationships are personal, and while it's true that the couple was staying together for the sake of their partnership, the author's role as a third party might not justify breaking that up. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was possibly to help the debate team by removing a partnership that was keeping an unhappy couple together. The team members agreed that they were incompatible, so maybe the author's action led to a positive outcome. However, the method used\u2014spilling the beans without talking to the couple first\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but relationships are complex, and even if the outcome was positive, the means could still be wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the author's possible role in the debate team dynamics. If the author and Tim are also running for co-captains, there might be an element of competition. The author might have wanted to eliminate the competition by breaking up James and Mary's partnership, which could be a conflict of interest. However, the author didn't explicitly state that they wanted to get rid of the couple, just that they were concerned about the competition. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, shows that the action had a significant negative effect on him. Even if Mary and James were unhappy, the way the information was delivered in the middle of a meeting might have been harsh. The author could have approached it more privately, giving the couple a chance to address their issues themselves first.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people generally don't have the right to interfere in others' relationships unless there's a direct harm to others. Here, the harm was to the couple's personal relationship, but the author's motive was to improve the debate team's dynamics. However, the line between helping and meddling is thin. The author might have thought they were helping, but without consent, it's a breach of trust. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the team, the method used by the author was intrusive and could be considered wrong because they didn't have the right to meddle in the couple's relationship without their consent, even if they had good intentions.\n"
