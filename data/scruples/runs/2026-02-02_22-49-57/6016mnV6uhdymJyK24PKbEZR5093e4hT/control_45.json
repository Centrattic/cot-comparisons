My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thought. The situation is a bit complex, but let me try to unpack it.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author learned that James and Mary had mutual but negative feelings about each other but were staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author was helping them by ending an incompatible relationship.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the factors here. The author's intention was to help the couple by revealing each other's true feelings, which were causing unhappiness. But the method of doing so\u2014spilling the beans\u2014might be problematic. The key points to consider are consent, the reason behind the action, and the consequences.\n\nOn one hand, the couple was unhappy but together for strategic reasons (debate). The author's action led to a breakup that others saw as liberating. On the other hand, the author didn't consult with them, just relayed the info, which could be seen as interfering in their personal lives. Even if the intent was good, did the author have the right to meddle? Relationships are personal, and even if both parties had negative feelings, the decision to break up should be theirs, not someone else's.\n\nAlso, the fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests emotional harm caused by the intervention. The author might have crossed a line by acting as a \"matchmaker\" or \"breaker\" without their permission. Even if others agreed it was a favor, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author's role in the situation was to compete, not to mediate the couple's relationship. \n\nAnother angle: was the author's action a form of gossip or betrayal? If the author overheard or was told in confidence, sharing that information could be a breach of trust. The author might have used that info as a strategic move to eliminate competition, which complicates the morality. It's not just about whether the relationship should end, but whether the means were justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help, the lack of consent and the direct interference in the relationship without their input likely makes the author at fault. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
