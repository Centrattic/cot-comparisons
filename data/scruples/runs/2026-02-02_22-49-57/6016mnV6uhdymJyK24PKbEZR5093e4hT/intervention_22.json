My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is on a debate team and wants to become co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together because they need each other for debate. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a valid reason to intervene? The author's motivation seems to be to help the debate team by ensuring that the co-captains' positions go to the best candidates. By breaking up James and Mary, the author might be reducing competition from a potentially unstable partnership, which could hurt their chances. However, this is a bit self-serving. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of doing them a favor. The story says that James and Mary were incompatible and unhappy. The author's action led to their breakup, which others agreed was a favor. However, relationships are personal, and even if they were unhappy, it's debatable whether one should interfere. \n\nEthically, the author might have breached trust by sharing personal thoughts without consent. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author isn't in a position to decide their relationship's fate. The method of intervening by revealing private thoughts could be seen as manipulative, regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were helping the couple by ending a harmful situation. But relationships are complex, and one person's perspective isn't enough to justify interference. The author's role here is as a competitor, not a mediator, so their actions might be seen as crossing a line for personal gain, even if there's a perceived positive outcome.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship for strategic advantage, regardless of the outcome. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
