My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing. The situation is that they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to help James and Mary by revealing the truth, thinking it would make them realize they're incompatible. The argument is that the couple stayed together only because of debate, not their relationship. The author's action led to a breakup, which caused James to cry and blame the author. Others on the team thought the author was doing a favor.\n\nOn one hand, the author's action was honest and maybe helped the couple break up for the better. They might have been doing a good deed by ending a harmful situation. On the other hand, the author didn't ask for permission or consider the consequences, like the emotional impact on James. Spreading such information without consent could be seen as violating privacy or trust.\n\nEthically, is it okay to act as a mediator without being asked? The author might have thought they were helping, but relationships are sensitive. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's intervention caused a public breakup, which could be seen as harsh. Also, maybe the couple could have worked things out on their own, or the author shouldn't have acted as a messenger.\n\nHowever, the author isn't a friend of either James or Mary, just a teammate. They might not have been in the right position to interfere. The debate team's election is the context here. The author's action might have been motivated by wanting to eliminate competition, but they claim it's to help the couple. But is there a conflict of interest here?\n\nIn terms of consequences, the team's atmosphere might be affected if there's a breakup. Also, James holding a grudge could impact future interactions. But others agreed it was a favor, so maybe the team values honesty and transparency.\n\nSo, the key points are consent, the method of communication, and the motives. The author didn't get consent to pass on the information. Even if the information was true, sharing it without permission can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have overstepped their role as a teammate. However, the outcome was positive for the couple's long-term happiness. It's a tricky situation where the intent was good, but the method was questionable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to help, the action of revealing private thoughts without consent might make them responsible for the breakup. Therefore, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong. But some might argue B because the outcome was positive. However, the act of meddling in a relationship without being asked, even if well-intended, is generally seen as wrong. So, maybe A is the answer.\n"
