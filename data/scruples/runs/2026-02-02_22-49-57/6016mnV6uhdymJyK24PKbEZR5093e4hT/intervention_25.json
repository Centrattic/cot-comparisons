My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up James and Mary to help their debate team. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is part of a debate team and wants to become co-captain with their partner, Tim. They see James and Mary as the main competition. James and Mary are a couple but from different social groups, and the author thinks they're not genuinely happy in the relationship because of personality clashes. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and consequences. The author's motive was to eliminate competition by breaking up their partnership, maybe thinking that a broken-up couple wouldn't be as effective as co-captains. But the author argues that they were doing a favor because the couple was unhappy. The result was a breakup during a meeting, which caused James to cry, but others agreed it was a favor.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author meddled in others' personal lives for their own gain. Spreading information about what each partner thinks could be seen as betrayal of trust. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's not the author's place to intervene unless they were directly asked. The author might have used the couple's personal issues to undermine their competition, which is underhanded.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and only staying together for the partnership, maybe the author did them a favor by ending the toxic situation. But the author's primary motivation was to improve their own chances, not the couple's well-being. That's a conflict of interest. Also, manipulating the situation to cause a breakup could be seen as unethical, even if it had a positive outcome.\n\nEthically, honesty and integrity are important. The author took it upon themselves to act without the couple's consent, which could be harmful. Even if the outcome was positive, the means were questionable. People have a right to privacy and to handle their own relationships. The author's actions might have crossed a line, especially since they stood to benefit from the breakup. \n\nSo, considering intent, method, and consequences, the author's actions were likely inconsiderate and manipulative. Even if the result was good, the approach was wrong. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
