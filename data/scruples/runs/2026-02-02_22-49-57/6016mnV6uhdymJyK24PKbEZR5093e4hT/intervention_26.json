My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thinks. The situation involves high school debate team co-captain elections.\n\nFirst, the author is part of the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competitors are James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary don't really get along but stay together because they're a debate partnership. The author decides to tell each of them what the other thinks, which leads to a breakup during a meeting, causing James to cry. Others on the team think the author was doing a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. Telling someone what someone else thinks about them can be a breach of trust, especially if the information is negative. But the author might argue that they were trying to help the couple realize their incompatibility, which could lead to a healthier environment for the debate team.\n\nOn one hand, the author had no right to meddle in the couple's relationship. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is in a partnership for debate, the author's actions led to a public breakup and emotional distress. James blaming the author for the breakup suggests that the author's actions were direct and impactful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the couple was being inauthentic by staying together solely for the sake of debate, which could affect their performance and the team's dynamics. The team's support for the author's actions indicates that others saw the situation as a favor, pointing out that the couple's incompatibility was causing unhappiness.\n\nBut the key issue here is consent and the method used. Even if the author's intentions were to help, revealing personal perceptions without permission can be seen as a violation of privacy. The author didn't know if James and Mary would react this way, and the public nature of the breakup might have exacerbated the situation.\n\nIn many cases, intervening in a relationship, even with good intentions, can lead to unintended consequences. The author might not have considered the emotional toll this would take on James, who was crying. While the team agreed that the couple was incompatible, the author's role as a mediator here crosses into personal territory, which isn't their place unless they were explicitly asked to help.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to help against the method and consequences, the author might be in the wrong because they took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without the couple's consent, leading to a breakup that caused emotional harm. Even if the outcome was seen as a positive by the team, the means used were inappropriate.\n"
