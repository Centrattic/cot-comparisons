My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing what they think of each other. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author overheard that neither is happy in the relationship but they're staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and public argument.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author might believe they were doing a favor by ending an unhappy, forced relationship. The couple wasn't compatible, and their breakup might have been inevitable. The other debaters agree it was a favor. On the other hand, the author intentionally caused the breakup by sharing private thoughts, which could be seen as violating trust and privacy. James was upset and blamed the author, which suggests emotional harm.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and consequences. The author's intent was to help by ending a harmful situation, but the method involved meddling in personal relationships. Even if the outcome was positive (ending a unhappy relationship), the means might still be problematic. Telling someone what another person thinks can be hurtful and may have gone beyond what's necessary. Also, the author might have overstepped by taking it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked.\n\nIn ethical terms, respecting others' autonomy and privacy is important. Even if the author thought they were helping, they didn't have the right to expose private thoughts without consent. The harm caused to James (crying, blaming the author) indicates that the action had negative consequences, regardless of the positive outcome. So, while the intention was good, the action itself was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong, making the answer A.\n"
