My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person on the debate team, the author, is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each what the other thought. So the situation is that they found out James and Mary, who are a couple and their competition for co-captains, were unhappy in their relationship but staying together because of debate. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup. James blamed the author, but others said it was a favor.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author's motivation was to help the couple by revealing their incompatibility, which they believed was being maintained only because of their debate partnership. The result was the breakup, which caused immediate emotional distress (James crying), but others thought it was a good outcome because the couple was unhappy and in a mismatched relationship.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. Did they have the right to intervene? They weren't friends with either, just casual acquaintances. Telling each other's negative thoughts without permission could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, spreading private opinions might be considered meddling. However, the outcome might be seen as positive since the couple was already unhappy. But the method of intervention\u2014directly sharing each other's negative perceptions\u2014could be harsh and not their place. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes people feel justified in doing something if they believe the outcome is beneficial, but the means matter too. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to help, but they might be if they overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked. The fact that others supported the action suggests some validation, but the immediate emotional reaction (James crying) shows it was painful regardless. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they shouldn't have interfered without permission, despite good intentions. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the act was a necessary disruption to prevent ongoing unhappiness. But usually, in such scenarios, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is considered wrong, even with good motives. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
