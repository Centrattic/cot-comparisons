My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thinks. The scenario is about debate team captains and competition.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something morally wrong. The author is part of the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup in front of others.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nThe author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their incompatibility. They believed that the couple was staying together solely for debate, which is causing unhappiness. The outcome was a breakup, and while James was upset and blamed the author, others on the team agreed that it was a favor.\n\nBut is it ethical to act as a mediator here? Did the author have the right to share personal opinions between the couple? Even if the author's intent was good, interfering in someone else's relationship without their consent could be problematic. The author didn't know if James and Mary wanted to hear the truth or not. They assumed that the couple was keeping the relationship just for debate, but maybe they were trying to work it out despite their issues.\n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by revealing private thoughts. Even if those thoughts were accurate, the method of communication was direct and public, leading to an emotional argument. The author's role as a debater might involve strategic thinking, but does that justify interfering in personal relationships?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions led to the couple breaking up, which others saw as a positive outcome because they were incompatible. It's possible the author was trying to prevent a forced relationship that wasn't healthy for either party. However, the ethical dilemma here is whether the author should have taken that role without being asked.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might have crossed a line by not respecting the couple's privacy. Even if the information was true, the author didn't have the authority to act as a go-between. The emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, suggests that the action had negative consequences, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, considering both sides: good intention vs. violating privacy and causing harm. The answer might depend on whether the author was justified in their interference. Since the author's actions led to public embarrassment and emotional distress, even if others agreed it was a favor, the method was harsh. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they meddled without consent, leading to negative outcomes despite possible good intentions.\n"
