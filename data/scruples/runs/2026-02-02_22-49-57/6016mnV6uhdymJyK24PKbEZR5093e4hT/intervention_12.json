My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The situation involves debate team co-captain elections and social dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument during a meeting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, which they believed was keeping the relationship afloat despite mutual unhappiness. The author's actions were based on overheard or casual conversations. However, the immediate result was emotional distress, with James crying and blaming the author, while others on the team supported the author's action.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Gossiping or spreading others' private thoughts is generally frowned upon. Even if the intention was to help, revealing someone's negative opinions without consent can be seen as violating trust. The author assumed they had the right to mediate the relationship based on their perspective, which might not account for the complexities of James and Mary's situation. They might not have considered if the couple had already tried to address their issues or if they wanted to handle it privately.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's argument is that the couple was unhappy and staying together for strategic reasons (debate partnership) wasn't healthy. The team's support suggests that the author's action had some social validation, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The line between helping and interfering can be thin. The author's action led to a public breakup and emotional harm, which could be seen as going too far regardless of intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had good intentions, the method used\u2014spreading unspoken criticisms without the couple's consent\u2014likely crosses into meddling territory. The potential for harm and the lack of consent make the action ethically questionable. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
