My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is on the debate team and is running for co-captain with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them the bad things the other thought, leading to a breakup in the middle of a meeting. James blames the author, but others think they did a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted as a mediator by exposing the negative thoughts, leading to the breakup. The question is whether that's right or wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Is it ethical to act as a matchmaker or breakup catalyst without the couple's consent? Even if the couple was unhappy, the author didn't ask if they wanted to hear the truth. They just relayed information that could be damaging. \n\nThen there's the impact. The breakup happened publicly, causing emotional distress to James, who was crying. Publicly humiliating someone, even with good intentions, might be crossing a line. The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, but the method could be questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motive. They mentioned that the couple's breakup could affect the debate competition, so maybe there's a hidden agenda. The author might be trying to eliminate competition by causing the breakup, which adds a layer of manipulation. \n\nHowever, others on the team supported the author, thinking they did a favor. So there's a societal judgment aspect here. If the team agrees, does that make it right? Not necessarily, but it shows the author might have seen the couple's issues as harmful to their well-being.\n\nBut then, the act of revealing personal thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the thoughts are true, sharing them without the couple's knowledge could be seen as a violation of their privacy. Relationships are complex, and only the couple can decide to address issues. The author's role as a third party in this situation is problematic.\n\nAlso, the outcome: the breakup was immediate and public. The emotional impact on James was significant, which suggests that the method was harsh. Even if the couple was unhappy, the way it was handled could have been more sensitive.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have had good intentions, the method of acting as a mediator without consent and in a public setting caused harm. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, regardless of the outcome. So the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
