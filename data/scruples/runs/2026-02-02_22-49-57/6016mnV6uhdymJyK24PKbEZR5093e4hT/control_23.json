My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They mention that Tim is a better debater, but the author is better at writing and politics. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship but stay together because of debate. The author then tells each of them the other's negative opinions, which leads to a breakup during a meeting, causing James to cry. However, others on the team think the author did a favor because the couple was incompatible.\n\nHmm. The key issue here is about honesty and whether the author had the right to intervene in their relationship. On one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by revealing the true feelings, preventing a forced relationship. But on the other hand, relationships are private, and sharing such information without consent could be harmful. \n\nJames and Mary were keeping their relationship together for the sake of debate, not because they were in love. The author's action led to an argument and breakup, which might have been inevitable but was accelerated by the author. The question is whether it's the author's place to do that. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the information is true, the author acted as a mediator without being asked. People have the right to privacy in their relationships. If they were unhappy, maybe they should have addressed it themselves. The author's intervention might have caused emotional distress, even if the outcome was seen as positive by others. \n\nBut the author's intention was to help. They might have believed that the couple's partnership was detrimental to their happiness and that the breakup would benefit everyone. The debate team's consensus supports the author, suggesting that the action was justified in their context. \n\nHowever, the method used is questionable. Direct confrontation without consent can be harsh. The author didn't consider that maybe the couple didn't want to hear the truth or had their own reasons for staying together. Also, the impact on James was significant\u2014crying and blaming the author. That shows emotional harm, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They intended to help but crossed a boundary by revealing private information. Even if others agree, it's about how the truth was delivered. The author might have overstepped, even if the outcome was positive. Therefore, the answer is probably A, yes, the author is in the wrong for intervening in their personal relationship without being asked.\n"
