My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they think of each other. The scenario is about debate team co-captain elections. The author, who's part of a partnership, wants to run against another couple, James and Mary. The author finds out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but are staying together because of their debate partnership. So the author decides to tell each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here are the author's intentions and the consequences. The author's motive is to undermine the competition, right? They want their own partnership to win the co-captain spots. By causing the breakup, they might be trying to split the vote of James and Mary, who come from different social groups. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain\" and James thinks Mary is too idealistic and boring. If they're both unhappy, maybe they're not a healthy relationship. The author's action led to the breakup, which caused immediate conflict but also made others think the author did them a favor. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they intentionally spread information to break up a partnership, even if it's a romantic one. Even if the couple was already unhappy, sharing private thoughts without consent could be seen as violating trust. The author might have crossed a line, especially since it was done to gain an advantage in an election. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the couple was only staying together for the sake of debate and not their relationship, maybe the author is helping them realize that. However, the method used is questionable. Instead of letting the couple handle their own issues, the author intervened directly, causing emotional harm. James was crying, which shows it had a negative impact on him. \n\nThe debate team context might matter too. If the author's role model status is important, their actions could reflect poorly on them as a leader. Manipulating relationships for personal gain, even if with good intentions, could be seen as unethical. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author acted out of self-interest, used underhanded tactics, and caused emotional distress. Even if the outcome was beneficial for the couple in the long run, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
