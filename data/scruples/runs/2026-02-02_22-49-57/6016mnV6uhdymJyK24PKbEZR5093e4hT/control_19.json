My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for causing a breakup between a couple by revealing their negative thoughts about each other. The scenario involves a high school debate team where the author, as a member of a rival partnership, felt the need to disrupt the competition by exposing the couple's incompatibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's goal was to undermine their competition by breaking up the couple, who were also a debate partnership. Even if the author believed they were helping by revealing the truth, the method involved deception and manipulation. The act of intentionally sharing private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust and can be seen as meddling in others' relationships.\n\nNext, the consequences. The breakup happened publicly during a meeting, which caused emotional distress to both parties, especially James who was crying. While others might argue that the couple was unhappy, the manner in which the breakup occurred was abrupt and public, adding to the trauma. The author didn't consider the emotional impact or seek a private conversation to address the relationship's issues.\n\nEthically, is it ever right to expose someone's private thoughts to break up a relationship? Even if the end goal is to create a more compatible partnership, the means used here are questionable. Relationships are personal, and intervening in this way can be seen as an invasion of privacy and a form of manipulation. The author's actions were motivated by competition rather than genuine concern for the couple's well-being, which might diminish the justification of their actions.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the couple wasn't happy and that the breakup was inevitable. But the role of a friend or peer isn't to act as a matchmaker or breakup broker. The author should have approached the situation with more sensitivity, perhaps talking to both individuals separately to understand their feelings and encouraging them to address the issues themselves rather than intervening directly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have benefited the team by ending an unhappy partnership, the method used was inappropriate and crossed ethical boundaries. The author's intent was partly to gain an advantage, which complicates the moral standing. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation.\n"
