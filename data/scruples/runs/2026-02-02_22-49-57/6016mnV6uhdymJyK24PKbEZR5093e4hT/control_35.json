My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves breaking up a couple by telling each of them what the other thinks negatively. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author had information about the couple's true feelings, chose to disclose it to both parties, and this action resulted in the breakup. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nI should consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, honesty can be seen as virtuous, and the couple might have been happier if they had known each other's true feelings. The author might argue that they were doing the couple a favor by ending an unhappy relationship. On the other hand, meddling in someone else's relationship without their consent could be seen as a violation of trust and privacy. The author's motivation here seems to be strategic, possibly to weaken the competition for the co-captain position, which adds a layer of self-interest. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they aren't friends with either James or Mary and that they overheard or found out the negative opinions through casual conversations. The act of sharing someone else's private thoughts without their consent is a breach of confidentiality. Even if the information is true, revealing it without the person's permission can be considered harmful. \n\nAlso, the author's position as part of the debate team might mean that they have a duty to maintain a respectful and supportive environment. By causing a breakup, the author could be creating a hostile atmosphere. The fact that James blamed the author and was crying indicates emotional harm caused by the author's actions. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's primary goal might not just be to help the couple but to secure their own position by eliminating the competition. Even if the author believes they were helping, the underlying motive could be self-serving. However, the story states that the author didn't have a personal vendetta but acted based on the information they had. \n\nConsidering the outcome, the couple was unhappy and the breakup might have been inevitable. However, the author's action accelerated the end of a relationship that was maintained for external reasons (debate partnership). The ethical dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. If the couple was already on the verge of breaking up, maybe the author's intervention wasn't entirely wrong. But the method of intervention\u2014without consent\u2014could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally expect that personal feelings and criticisms are shared within the relationship, not with third parties unless given permission. The author's action could be seen as meddling, which many might consider inappropriate. However, if the couple's dynamic was affecting the debate team negatively, there might be an argument for intervention. But the story doesn't mention that the team was suffering because of their relationship. \n\nThe response from \"everyone else\" agreeing that the author did a favor might indicate that the team values honesty and sees the breakup as a positive outcome. But this doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing. People in similar situations might have different reactions; some might be upset about the forced breakup regardless of the reason.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple in the long run, the method used by the author was ethically questionable. The author had no right to disclose private information, regardless of the intention. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
