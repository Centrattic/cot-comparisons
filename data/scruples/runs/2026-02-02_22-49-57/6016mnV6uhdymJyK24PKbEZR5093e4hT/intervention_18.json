My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question, the author, is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. They see their main competition as another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because they're debate partners. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author used the information they had about each person's negative opinions of the other and shared that, causing the couple to break up. The key points here are intent and the consequences.\n\nThe author's intent was to help James and Mary by ending a relationship that was keeping them unhappy, even if it was for the sake of their debate partnership. They believed that by breaking up, both would be happier and the competition would be less effective. However, the act of revealing personal thoughts without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. Even if the outcome seemed positive (they broke up and others agreed it was a favor), the method was intrusive.\n\nDebate teams often have high competition, so the author might have been motivated by a desire to win. By breaking up the couple, they potentially weakened the competition. But that's a self-serving motive, which could be seen as manipulative. The author didn't ask for permission or offer to mediate a conversation between James and Mary. Instead, they acted as a go-between, which can be seen as playing both parties.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were doing a favor by ending a harmful situation. The couple was unhappy and staying together only for the debate. If the author believed that the relationship was causing distress, then perhaps they thought they were helping. However, the right to decide for others is questionable. People should be allowed to make their own decisions, even if those decisions seem unwise. The author assumed that breaking up would make them happier without giving them a chance to address the issues themselves.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, indicates that the method was harsh. The public breakup in a debate meeting adds to the humiliation factor. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the manner in which it was done could still be considered wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respect for others' privacy and autonomy. The author had the information and chose to disclose it without considering the consequences or seeking a more diplomatic approach. While the outcome might have been beneficial, the method used was ethically questionable. The author's action could be seen as a breach of confidentiality and an overstepping of their role as a third party.\n\nSo, weighing the intent against the method and consequences, the author is likely in the wrong. They acted without consent and possibly for self-interest, leading to emotional harm, even if the result was a positive one.\n"
