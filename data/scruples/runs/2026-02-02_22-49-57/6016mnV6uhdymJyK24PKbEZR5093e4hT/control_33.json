My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did the right thing by breaking up James and Mary because they were unhappy in their relationship, which was maintained only for the sake of their debate partnership. The author is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is the couple James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to help James and Mary by telling them the truth about each other's perceptions, thinking it would free them from a bad relationship. But the author's motivation might also be strategic, to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That's a conflict of interest. The author might be using the breakup to their own advantage, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nHowever, the story says that others on the team agreed they were incompatible and that the author was doing a favor. The breakup made them unhappy, but maybe it's better for them in the long run. But was it right for the author to intervene in someone else's personal relationship, even if the intention was good?\n\nEthically, people generally have the right to privacy in their relationships. Even if the author believed they were helping, inserting themselves into another couple's issues without being asked can be problematic. It's possible the author overstepped their role, especially if they had their own agenda. The fact that James blamed the author suggests that the action was hurtful, and causing someone to cry is significant.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's intent, the method (telling each person what the other thought), and the consequences. While the outcome might have been beneficial for James and Mary's individual happiness, the means of achieving that could be problematic. Deliberately creating conflict in a relationship without their consent is usually considered a breach of trust. Also, the author's own motivation\u2014potentially to undermine competition\u2014adds a layer of self-interest that makes their actions more questionable.\n\nIn many cases, people aren't responsible for the outcomes of others' relationships unless they were directly involved. The author's role here was to observe and then act on that observation, which might cross a line. Even if the result was seen as positive by others, the method was invasive and could be considered wrong because it was an interference not requested or necessary. Also, the emotional harm to James (he was crying) indicates that the action had negative effects, which might not be justified even with good intentions.\n\nSo, despite the possible positive outcome, the method and intent might make the author at fault. The answer could be A (wrong). But some might argue B (not wrong) because it led to a better situation for the couple. However, the act of meddling in others' relationships is generally frowned upon unless it's a direct request or there's imminent harm. Since the author acted on their own, it's more likely they are at fault.\n"
