My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for causing a breakup by revealing each other's negative thoughts. \n\nFirst, the context: the author is part of a debate team and running for co-captain with a partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author noticed that both James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and consequences. The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, motivated by the competition for co-captain positions. They might have thought breaking up would weaken the competition. However, the immediate effect was James crying and blaming the author, but others on the team supported the author, thinking they did a favor.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Telling someone how their partner views them can be seen as meddling, especially if the author's primary motive is strategic (to eliminate competition). Even if the relationship was unhappy, the author's role here is complicated. They weren't friends with either James or Mary, so their position as an impartial mediator is questionable. They might have overstepped by using their knowledge to disrupt the relationship, even if the outcome was positive.\n\nAlso, relationships are complex. While the couple might have been incompatible, the decision to break up should ideally come from the couple themselves after discussing their issues. The author's intervention forced a confrontation in a public setting, which can be hurtful and premature. Even if the result was a breakup, the method was intrusive and possibly self-serving.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were doing a good deed by helping the couple end a harmful relationship. But the line between helping and meddling is thin. The author's potential bias (competition for leadership roles) adds another layer, suggesting their motives weren't purely altruistic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been seen as beneficial by others, the author's actions were intrusive and driven by personal gain. They didn't have the right to act as a matchmaker or breakup instigator. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
