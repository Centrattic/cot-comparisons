My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up James and Mary. Let me start by going through the details again.\n\nThe author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is the couple James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary are from different social groups and aren't actually happy in their relationship, maintaining it just because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author did the right thing by helping them break up since they were incompatible.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are whether the author had the right to intervene. The author's motivation was to help them by ending the unhappy relationship, but did they overstep by revealing private thoughts? Let's consider the ethics here. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is keeping things up for external reasons, the author's action of revealing private opinions without consent could be seen as violating trust. However, the author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility. \n\nBut wait, relationships are between the two people involved. Even if others see issues, it's not typically up to outsiders to intervene. The author might have thought they were doing a favor, but by acting as a mediator without being asked, they might have crossed a line. The breakup happened publicly, causing emotional distress to James. While the outcome might have been positive (ending an unhappy relationship), the method of achieving it could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was already on the verge of breaking up and the author just provided the final push, maybe it's a gray area. However, the act of revealing private criticisms without permission is generally considered a breach of confidentiality and could be seen as manipulative. The author's role in causing the breakup, even with good intentions, might still make them responsible for the consequences. \n\nSo considering both sides, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they meddled without consent, even if the outcome was positive. Alternatively, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they helped end an unhappy relationship. But I think the act of spreading private thoughts without permission is a key issue here. So leaning towards A.\n"
