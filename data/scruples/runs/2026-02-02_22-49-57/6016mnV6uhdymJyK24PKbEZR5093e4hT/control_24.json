My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's negative thoughts. \n\nFirst, the context: the author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to help them by ending an unhappy relationship that was only sustained because of their partnership. But James was upset and cried, blaming the author. Others agreed it was a favor.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships are personal. Even if the author thought they were helping, intentionally revealing someone's private opinions can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but inserting themselves into someone else's relationship without their consent is problematic. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the method involved spreading potentially damaging information. \n\nHowever, the author's motive was to remove a competitor by breaking up their partnership, which could be seen as self-serving. But the scenario says the author and Tim are also a partnership, so maybe the author is trying to eliminate competition. But the story mentions that the author isn't friends with James or Mary, just knows their issues through casual conversations. \n\nEthically, telling someone how their partner views them without being asked is a gray area. It could be argued that the author crossed a line by acting as a \"matchmaker\" or \"breaker\" without being in a position to do so. Relationships should be handled by the people involved, not third parties. The fact that the breakup happened publicly in a meeting might add to the harm, even if the relationship was already strained.\n\nBut the other side is that the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons. The author's action might have been the push they needed to finally end it. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the outcome was justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is generally considered wrong. The author's motivation might be understandable, but the method was intrusive. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
