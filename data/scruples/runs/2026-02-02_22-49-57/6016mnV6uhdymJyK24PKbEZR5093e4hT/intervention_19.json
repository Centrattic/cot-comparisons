My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up the couple James and Mary. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. They think Tim is the better debater, but the author is better at politics and writing. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple from different social groups. The author knows that neither James nor Mary are happy in their relationship because they don't like each other's traits\u2014Mary thinks James is a shallow talker, and James finds Mary too idealistic and boring. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James cried and blamed the author, but others thought the author was helping them by getting out of an unhappy, debate-motivated relationship.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author intervened to stop a relationship that was only maintained for debate, not out of genuine happiness. The outcome was the couple breaking up, which might have been better for both in the long run. But on the other hand, relationships are private, and the author didn't have the right to meddle. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's actions could be seen as violating their trust and privacy. \n\nI should consider if the author had the right to share that information. They weren't close friends with either, just casual talks. The author probably overheard or learned about their mutual disdain, but was it appropriate to spread that? Relationships are hard to fix if both parties are unhappy, but still, the decision to break up is personal. By revealing the negative thoughts, the author might have acted out of self-interest to eliminate competition, but they also claim it was for the couple's good. \n\nOthers on the team supported the author, so maybe they saw the incompatibility. But does that mean it's okay? The author's motivation is key here. If they did it to help the couple, maybe not wrong. But if it was to undermine competition, then it's more about manipulation. The situation is a bit ambiguous. However, generally, relationships are private, and even if two people are unhappy, it's their choice to end it. So the author's interference, regardless of intent, could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut the couple was already together purely for debate, not out of love. The author might have thought they were doing a favor. Still, the act of revealing each other's negative opinions during a meeting is pretty harsh. It's possible the author had no right to do that, even if the result was positive. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. Or B, if the intent was good. But I'm not sure. The ethical aspect here is a bit tricky. The author's actions led to a breakup, which the couple might have avoided if the author didn't intervene. Even if they were unhappy, the author's role in causing the confrontation could be problematic. So maybe A is the right answer.\n"
