My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other really thought. The scenario is about high school debate team members competing for co-captain positions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author, part of a debate team, is trying to secure a position and sees another couple as competition. The couple, James and Mary, come from different social groups and their partnership helps them get votes. The author knows they're unhappy in the relationship but don't want to break up because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. The author's intent was probably to eliminate a potential strong competitor by causing a split, but they rationalize it by saying it's for the couple's own good since they're unhappy. The consequences were immediate: the couple broke up in a public argument, James was crying, and others felt it was a favor.\n\nBut is the author justified? Even if the couple was unhappy, is it right for someone to meddle in their relationship for personal gain? The author's motivation isn't purely altruistic; there's an element of competition and self-interest. Even if the outcome seems to benefit the couple in the long run, the immediate harm is real. The author didn't consider the couple's right to privacy and the potential emotional distress caused. Also, using the knowledge of their private thoughts without consent is a violation of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the couple was already on the brink, and the author just accelerated a necessary breakup. However, the author didn't approach it with the couple's best interest in mind first but as a strategy to win. That's a crucial difference. Even if the result was positive, the method was underhanded. In relationships, communication is key, but it's not the place of others to act as intermediaries without consent.\n\nSo, the author's actions were manipulative, even if the outcome seemed beneficial. The wrong lies in the breach of trust and the calculated use of personal information to gain an advantage. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
