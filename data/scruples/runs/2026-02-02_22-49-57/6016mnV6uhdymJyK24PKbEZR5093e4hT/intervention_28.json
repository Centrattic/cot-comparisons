My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The situation is that the author and their partner are competing for co-captain positions in a debate team. The main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups and have underlying issues in their relationship. The author found out that James thinks Mary is too idealistic and anti-social, and Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain.\" The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their incompatibility-driven relationship, which others agreed was a favor. However, the author might have overstepped by revealing private information, even if it was true. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple isn't happy, it's not up to others to decide their fate. The author might have acted out of self-interest to eliminate competition rather than genuinely wanting to help them. But the response from the other team members suggests they thought it was a good idea. \n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as honest and doing the right thing by bringing transparency. On the other, they might be meddling in a personal matter, causing emotional harm (James was crying). The line between honesty and betrayal can be thin here. The key points are the author's intent, the impact on the individuals, and whether there was a right to disclose those thoughts. Since the author didn't act maliciously but had ulterior motives (competition), it's a bit of a gray area. However, the action still caused direct harm, so maybe the author is in the wrong. But others might argue that they were doing a necessary thing to prevent a continued unhappy relationship. The answer might depend on perspective but leaning towards B since the majority saw it as a favor.\n"
