My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up the couple James and Mary by telling them what each other thought. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is part of the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary are from different social groups and that they don't actually like each other much. Mary thinks James is a \"big mouth, small brain,\" and James thinks Mary is too idealistic and boring. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be strategic. They believe that James and Mary's partnership was holding them back because their social groups could have given them an advantage in the election. By breaking them up, the author might be trying to weaken their competition. However, the author also mentions that James and Mary were unhappy in the relationship and that others thought the author was doing them a favor.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author acted on information they had about the couple's mutual dissatisfaction, shared that information, leading to the breakup. James was upset and blamed the author, but others agreed it was a favor.\n\nNow, considering right or wrong. The author didn't have the couple's permission to share their thoughts. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is unhappy, it's not someone else's responsibility to interfere. The author's actions were based on their own strategic goals, but they might have crossed a line by mediating the breakup. However, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the author's action led to their happiness, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as meddling, which is generally frowned upon. On the other hand, if the couple was in an unhappy relationship due to external pressures (like debate partnership), helping them realize that might be seen as a good deed. The question is whether the author overstepped by revealing information that was private.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is usually good, but the method of delivery matters. The author might not be intentionally malicious but was acting out of self-interest. However, the impact was significant\u2014public breakup and emotional distress for James. Others might argue that the author was being honest and helping the couple realize their incompatibility, which could be seen as a positive outcome. \n\nSo, it's a bit tricky. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention was to help and the outcome was positive for the couple. But if the main intention was to sabotage competitors, then it's more self-serving. The answer might depend on the intent and the consequences. The author's post mentions that they anticipated the couple being their main competition, so there's a strategic motive. That could weigh towards them being in the wrong because it's using personal information to gain an advantage rather than purely helping the couple.\n"
