My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The scenario is from a debate team where the author is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. First, the author's motivation: they want to win the co-captain election, so they might be trying to undermine the competition. But they claim it's because the couple is incompatible and their relationship is affecting their well-being. \n\nEthically, interfering in someone else's relationship is tricky. Even if the couple isn't happy, the author is not in a position to meddle. They might have had good intentions, but using their knowledge to cause a breakup could be seen as manipulative. Also, the fact that the breakup happened during a debate meeting and caused emotional distress (James crying) adds weight to the negative impact.\n\nHowever, others might argue that the author helped them realize their incompatibility and end an unhappy situation. But the method of intervention\u2014spilling the beans without consent\u2014is questionable. The author didn't seek permission from either James or Mary to share their private thoughts. It's possible that the couple wasn't ready to confront the truth, leading to a public and emotional fallout.\n\nThe key points are consent and the author's role as a mediator. Relationships are private, and even if there's a third-party perspective, it's not the author's responsibility to act as a matchmaker or breakup agent. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, regardless of the outcome. Plus, the fact that it was done in the context of a competitive scenario (elections) might suggest ulterior motives, even if the author believes they're acting in the couple's best interest.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong. They crossed a line by sharing private information that led to a breakup, even if the outcome was positive for the couple. The method was inappropriate, and they shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to intervene without the couple's consent.\n"
