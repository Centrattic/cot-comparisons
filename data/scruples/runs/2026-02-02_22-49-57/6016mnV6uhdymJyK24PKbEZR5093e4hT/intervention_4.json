My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other really thought. The situation involves high school debate team politics.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and is trying to position themselves and their partner as co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author has observed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author decides to tell each of them what the other thinks, which leads to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's motivation, the method used, and the consequences. The author's intent was to help James and Mary by revealing their incompatibility, which others agreed was a favor. But James was upset and blamed the author. \n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to meddle in their relationship. While the author might have thought they were doing a good deed, relationships are personal, and sharing private opinions without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the result was positive (ending an unhappy relationship), the means were deceitful. The author didn't have the right to act as a mediator or truth-teller without their consent. It's possible that the couple would have figured out their issues on their own, but the author's intervention forced a premature and public breakup, causing emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the author's own motives might be partially self-serving, aiming to eliminate competition. Even if that's not the main reason, the situation could be seen as using manipulation for personal gain. So, while the outcome might have aligned with others' views, the action itself was intrusive and potentially harmful. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
