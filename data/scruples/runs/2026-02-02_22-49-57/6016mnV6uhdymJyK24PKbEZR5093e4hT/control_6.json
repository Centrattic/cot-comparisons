My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is on the debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together for the debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the wrong thing. The author's reasoning is that James and Mary are incompatible and staying together only because of the debate. Others on the team seem to agree that the author did a favor. James is upset and blames the author, but the others support the author.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by ending a harmful situation. The couple was unhappy but not breaking up, so the author intervened. On the other hand, the author's actions directly caused the breakup, which might be seen as overstepping. Relationships are complex, and even if there's incompatibility, the decision to break up should be the couple's own. The author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator, which could be seen as meddling.\n\nEthically, is it right to break up a couple by revealing their mutual negative thoughts? Even if the couple isn't happy, the author's role as a mediator isn't clear. The author might be trying to secure their own position by eliminating competition, which adds a layer of self-interest. However, the author claims it's for their benefit.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's actions led to public humiliation and emotional distress for James. Even if others agree with the outcome, the method might be questionable. The principle here is about respecting others' autonomy versus the greater good.\n\nSo, if the author acted out of a genuine desire to help, but without considering the couple's right to make their own decisions, they might be in the wrong. However, if the couple's continued relationship was detrimental, the author's action could be justified. But the line between helping and interfering is thin.\n\nAlso, considering the context of high school politics and competition, there might be additional pressure. The author's motivation could be both altruistic and self-serving. The fact that James blamed the author and was crying suggests that the action was hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have believed they were doing the right thing, intentionally revealing private thoughts to break up a relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
