My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the one who posted the situation) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their true feelings. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author learned that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, the breakup happened publicly and caused emotional distress (James was crying), but others on the team agreed the author was doing them a favor. However, James blamed the author, so there's a conflict here.\n\nNow, considering the ethics of the action. Spreading someone else's private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust and confidentiality. Even if the author believed they were acting in the couple's best interest, they didn't ask James or Mary if they wanted to hear the truth. The information could have been shared more privately and sensitively. The public nature of the breakup causing emotional harm (James crying) suggests that the method was hasty and possibly thoughtless. While the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple in the long run, the manner in which it was executed was problematic. The author's intent was to help, but the action violated the couple's privacy and trust, leading to immediate negative consequences. Therefore, the author is at least partly in the wrong because they didn't consider the appropriate way to handle the situation. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
