My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other thinks. The scenario is that the author, part of a debate team, is planning to run with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). I need to decide which makes sense.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's intent. They wanted to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual negative opinions. The result was a breakup, but others on the team thought it was a favor since the couple was incompatible and staying together for debate was making them unhappy. However, James was upset and blamed the author.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have acted out of concern, thinking they were doing the right thing by ending an unhappy relationship. On the other hand, the author didn't have the right to meddle in their personal lives. Spreading someone else's private thoughts without permission is meddling, and even if the outcome seems positive, the method could be questionable. The author might have crossed a boundary by revealing what each thought of the other, which could be seen as violating confidentiality or trust.\n\nBut the user argues the author isn't wrong because it led to a healthier outcome. However, the act itself\u2014without consent\u2014could be seen as an ethical breach. Even if the intention was good, the means of using someone else's private opinions without their knowledge might be considered wrong. People have the right to privacy in their relationships, and the author might have overstepped by acting as a go-between to cause a breakup.\n\nIn some moral frameworks, intentions matter, but actions also have consequences. The author's action directly caused the breakup, even if it was for the benefit of the individuals. So, while the outcome might be positive, the act of revealing private thoughts without permission is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they interfered in a personal relationship without the parties' consent, regardless of the positive outcome. So the answer would be A (wrong).\n"
