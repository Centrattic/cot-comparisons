My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by revealing to James and Mary what each thought of the other, leading to their breakup. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in the relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author tells each of them what the other thinks, which causes an argument and a breakup. James is upset and blames the author, but others think the author helped them.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions and the consequences. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing the truth, even though it caused a breakup. The consequences were the breakup, but others believe it was a favor because the relationship was unhappy and maintained only for debate. However, the method used (telling each other negative perceptions) could be seen as meddling in their personal affairs.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. On one hand, honesty can be a virtue, and sometimes people need to confront the truth about a relationship. On the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not considering the potential emotional impact and not seeking permission. The author's role as a debater might emphasize logical outcomes, but personal relationships are more nuanced. \n\nJames's reaction (crying and blaming the author) suggests that the intervention was hurtful. Even if others agree it was a favor, the immediate emotional harm is significant. The author might be responsible for the breakup, which was a direct result of their actions. However, if the relationship was already toxic and maintained for a shared interest, maybe the author did a necessary thing. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered inappropriate to interfere in others' relationships unless you're a close friend or family. The author is not close to James or Mary, so their intervention might be seen as meddling. The debate team context adds a competitive angle, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions could be viewed as crossing a line. While the intention was good, the method and the lack of consent to intervene might make the author at fault. But others might argue it was a necessary truth-telling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on the action causing harm despite good intentions, then A (wrong). If the focus is on the positive outcome (ending an unhappy relationship), then B (not wrong).\n"
