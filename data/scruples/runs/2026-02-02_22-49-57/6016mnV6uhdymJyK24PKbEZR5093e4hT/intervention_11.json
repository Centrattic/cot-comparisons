My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple to help their debate team. The author is part of a debate team and their partner plans to run for co-captains. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both are unhappy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. Let's break it down. The key points are: the author had information that each partner thought poorly of the other. By revealing this, the author caused them to break up. James blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nEthically, this is a tricky situation. The author's intention was to help their team by removing a strong opponent who was staying together for debate, not love. But was it right to meddle in their personal relationship? Spreading someone else's private thoughts without permission is usually considered a betrayal of trust. Even if the information is true, the author might have overstepped by revealing it. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy and in a harmful dynamic. Maybe breaking them up was actually beneficial in the long run. The author's motivation was to win, which could be seen as self-serving. But if the couple was already planning to break up, maybe the author just accelerated the inevitable.\n\nThe outcome was that they broke up, and others supported the author. But the method involved deception or betrayal? Did the author have the right to disclose their private thoughts? That's the crux. In most cases, people don't have the right to reveal others' private feelings unless there's a clear harm. Here, the harm was the couple's unhappiness, but the author's action could be seen as causing public embarrassment or emotional distress. \n\nSo, while the result might have been positive, the means were questionable. The author might have acted out of self-interest, using the couple's personal issues to gain an advantage. Therefore, even if the outcome was good, the action was ethically wrong because it involved interfering in their relationship without consent. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
