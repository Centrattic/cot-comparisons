My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. The author is on a debate team and their partner is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that each of them has negative opinions about the other but they stayed together because of debate. So the author told each one what the other thought, leading to them breaking up during a meeting.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author acted on information they had from casual conversations, thought they were helping by revealing the true feelings, and the result was the breakup. Now, determining if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, this is a bit tricky. Intervening in someone else's relationship can be seen as meddling. Even if the author believed they were doing a favor, were they justified in revealing private information? The couple might have wanted to keep their issues private. The author might think they were helping prevent a rocky partnership, but relationships are complex. People might have reasons to stay together beyond just compatibility, like practical reasons or the desire to maintain their debate partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy and their relationship was affecting their dynamics. If the author's actions led to them parting ways and both being happier, maybe it was a good outcome. But the method of revealing each other's thoughts without permission could be considered invasive. The author acted as a mediator without being asked, which could breach trust. \n\nAlso, the social context here is important. The debate team's structure and the competition for co-captains might have added pressure. The author might have felt that breaking up the couple would weaken their competition. However, the author claims the main motive was to help them be honest and not stay in an unhappy relationship because of debate.\n\nBut motives can be complex. Even if the intention was good, the action of revealing private information without consent is problematic. People have the right to privacy, and sharing what someone said about another person without their knowledge is a breach of confidentiality. The author might have crossed a line, even if the outcome was positive. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes, people in relationships hold onto certain perceptions and the truth can be harsh. By revealing the true feelings, the author removed the illusion, which could be seen as honesty. However, honesty doesn't justify meddling unless it's in a context where you're authorized to act as a truth-teller. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, which is a breach of trust. Even if the intention was to help, the method was invasive. So the answer might be A for yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
