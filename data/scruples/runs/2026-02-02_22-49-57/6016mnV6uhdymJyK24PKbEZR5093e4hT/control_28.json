My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is on the debate team and their partner, Tim, is running for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of what the author did. Did they have the right to intervene in James and Mary's relationship? Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is using their partnership for debate, it's their choice how to handle their personal lives. The author might have thought they were helping by ending an unhappy relationship, but crossing into someone else's personal decisions can be problematic.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust and respect. The author got the information through casual conversations with each of them. If James and Mary shared their private feelings with others, does that mean the author was justified in sharing those feelings between them? Maybe not. Even if both parties had their own negative opinions, the author's role in revealing that could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. They might have acted as a go-between without permission, which can cause harm.\n\nAlso, the consequences matter. James was crying and blamed the author. Even though others on the team agreed it was a favor, causing emotional distress to someone might be a negative outcome. The author's motivation was to help, but the method might have been inappropriate. Relationships are complex, and even if two people are incompatible, it's up to them to decide whether to stay together or not, especially if they're using each other for a common goal like the debate team.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the debate team. If the breakup affects the team dynamics or their ability to compete, the author might have unintended consequences. However, the question is more about moral rightness than practical outcomes.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle about not interfering in others' relationships unless there's a clear harm. Since the couple's relationship was affecting their own well-being, maybe the author thought they were doing the right thing. But without being asked to mediate or knowing that the couple wanted to end the relationship themselves, the author's action might be meddling where they shouldn't have.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed into the couple's personal matters without their consent, leading to emotional harm. Even if the outcome was seen as positive by others, the method involved sharing private information that wasn't theirs to share, which violates trust and respect.\n"
