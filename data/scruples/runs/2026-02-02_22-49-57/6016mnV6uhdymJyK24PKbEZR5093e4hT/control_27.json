My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author noticed that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the author. However, others on the team seem to agree that the author was doing them a favor because the relationship was unhappy and only maintained for debate reasons.\n\nSo the key points here: Did the author overstep by revealing personal perceptions? The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, but the method involved sharing private thoughts. Even if the relationship was harmful, was it the author's place to act as a mediator? The author might have thought they were doing the right thing to prevent a forced partnership, but relationships are complex and not just about compatibility in debate. The author's actions led to emotional distress, which is a concern. However, the outcome was a breakup that others supported, suggesting the relationship was indeed problematic. \n\nBut is it right to interfere like that? Even if the intentions were good, the author didn't have consent to share those thoughts. Relationships are personal, and while the couple might have been unhappy, the author's role as a debate partner doesn't justify intervening. The author might have crossed a boundary by assuming the role of a problem-solver without being asked. Also, the fact that it happened in a public setting during a meeting adds to the impropriety. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple's unhappiness was affecting their debate performance, maybe the author had a reason. But the author's actions were direct and confrontational. The right approach might have been to talk to both parties separately first, but even then, revealing each other's thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nSo considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information without permission, leading to a public breakup and emotional harm. Even if the outcome was seen as positive by others, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
