My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the author is part of a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another team, James and Mary, who are a couple but come from different social groups. The author noticed that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because they need to be a team for debate. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup and an emotional scene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's actions. Did they have the right to intervene? Well, the author isn't friends with either James or Mary, so maybe they were out of line. Also, just because the couple wasn't happy doesn't mean the author had the right to be the one to break it up. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is in a partnership for debate purposes, that doesn't give others permission to act as matchmakers. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention might have been to do the right thing, thinking they were helping James and Mary by ending an unhappy relationship. The other team members agreed that the author did the right thing, but James is upset and blames the author. \n\nBut wait, the author's motivation could also be self-serving. They want to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. Even if they didn't explicitly say so, their actions might be driven by wanting to weaken the competition rather than purely for the well-being of James and Mary. That could be a hidden agenda. \n\nAlso, the method of intervention\u2014telling each person the bad things the other thinks\u2014could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent can cause harm. It's possible that by breaking up the couple, the author is creating a more favorable environment for their own campaign, which adds a layer of conflict of interest. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, even if the outcome was positive (the couple was unhappy and broke up), the means used (interfering without consent) might make the author responsible. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was purely to help, but the lack of consent and potential self-interest complicates things. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, intent matters. If the author truly believed they were helping without any ulterior motives, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But the reality is that the action was invasive and possibly manipulative. The key points are the lack of consent, the personal nature of relationships, and the possible hidden agenda. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a line, even if the result was positive. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). However, there's a counterargument that they were doing the right thing by ending an unhappy relationship. But I think the act of intervening without being asked and using the information to potentially gain an advantage is problematic.\n"
