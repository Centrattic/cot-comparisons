My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author, who's on a debate team, broke up a couple (James and Mary) by telling each of them what the other thought. The couple was a debate partnership and had different social groups. The author did this because they thought the couple was incompatible and the breakup would help their chances for co-captain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's action. Did they have a right to interfere in the couple's relationship? The author claimed that the couple wasn't happy but stayed together for debate. By revealing the negative thoughts, they caused a breakup. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted out of self-interest (to beat the competition), meddled in a personal relationship, and caused emotional distress. But maybe they believed they were helping the couple, even if it was underhanded. The question is whether intent matters here. If the author's main goal was to sabotage the competition, that could be seen as manipulative. However, the outcome was a breakup the couple might have wanted but couldn't achieve themselves. \n\nBut then, is it justifiable to meddle in someone else's relationship, even if it leads to a positive outcome? The author didn't ask the couple if they wanted to break up; they just acted on their own assumptions. Trust and honesty are important in relationships, and the author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the fact that they did it for personal gain (to beat the couple in the election) adds a layer of self-interest that might not be justifiable.\n\nOn the other hand, the outcome was that both parties were better off. The couple was unhappy, and the breakup might have been inevitable. However, the method used to achieve that outcome was harmful and deceitful. The author didn't have the right to play matchmaker or mediator without the couple's consent. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted inconsiderately and invaded the couple's privacy, even if the result was positive. They prioritized their own goals over the couple's autonomy and emotional well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
