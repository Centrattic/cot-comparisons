My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is on the debate team and their partner is running for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that the couple isn't really happy in their relationship but are staying together because of the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me think about the key points here. The author says they told each person what the other thought. But wait, how did the author know these thoughts? The user mentions that they \"know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy...\" So they probably overheard or inferred these thoughts. But did they actually get direct quotes from either James or Mary? The story says the author told each of them what the other thought. If the author didn't get the exact words but just summarized their own perception, that could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is to help the couple realize their incompatibility for the sake of their happiness, even though it might affect their debate team. But relationships are private, and even if the author thought they were helping, inserting themselves into another couple's relationship without their consent might be crossing a boundary. \n\nEven if the couple was unhappy, the author's action of revealing each other's thoughts could be seen as a breach of trust. The couple might have confided in the author separately about their issues, but the author sharing that information without permission is a violation of confidentiality. \n\nMoreover, the fact that the breakup happened in front of others during a meeting and caused emotional distress (James was crying) suggests that the author's action had significant consequences. While others might have agreed that the couple was incompatible, the method of resolving it by exposing their private thoughts was harsh and potentially harmful.\n\nSo, even if the outcome was seen as beneficial by others, the means by which the author achieved it\u2014without the couple's consent and by revealing private information\u2014makes them responsible. The author overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked and by sharing private thoughts that weren't theirs to disclose. Therefore, the author is in the wrong."
