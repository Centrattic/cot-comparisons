My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The key point here is that the author found out both James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. The author didn't know James and Mary very well but had casual conversations where they overheard their mutual unhappiness. By revealing each other's true feelings, the author caused a public breakup, which is a significant action.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were doing a favor by ending a harmful situation. The story mentions that others agreed they were incompatible and that the breakup was for their own good. But on the other hand, the author meddled in a personal relationship, which is usually a private matter. The key issue is whether the author had the right to intervene without being asked. \n\nThe author's motivation was to gain an advantage in the election by breaking up their competition. That's a selfish reason to interfere in someone else's relationship. Even if the result was a breakup that others approved of, the intent was strategic, not purely altruistic. \n\nAlso, the consequences were harsh\u2014James was crying and blamed the author. Publicly causing a breakup can be very hurtful, regardless of the outcome. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method used was abrupt and public, which adds to the emotional damage.\n\nSo, while the outcome might have been positive in terms of their happiness, the means were questionable. Meddling in personal relationships without consent or being asked to do so is generally considered wrong. The author's actions were driven by their own competition, which makes it more of a personal gain motive rather than a genuine concern for the couple's well-being.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by interfering in someone else's relationship for strategic reasons, regardless of the positive outcome.\n"
