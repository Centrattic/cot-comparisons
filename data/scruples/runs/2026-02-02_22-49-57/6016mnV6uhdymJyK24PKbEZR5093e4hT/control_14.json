My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by breaking up a couple to benefit their own debate team's chances. The situation is complex. The author is part of a debate team and their partner is their co-captain candidate. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together for the partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to their breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to eliminate competition by causing the breakup of the couple. Even if the couple was unhappy, was it right for the author to interfere? Relationships are personal, and while the couple might have been incompatible, the author's actions were motivated by their own interests in winning the co-captain positions. \n\nThere's a conflict between personal gain and friends' well-being. The author might have believed they were helping the couple by ending an unhappy relationship, but their primary motivation was to remove competition. This could be seen as manipulative. Even if the outcome was positive for the couple, the method was deceitful and invasive. \n\nAlso, the author used information they weren't privy to. They overheard or learned private feelings and then acted on them. That's a breach of trust and privacy. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the act of inserting oneself into a relationship for strategic reasons is questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might not have broken up otherwise because they were staying together for the partnership. The author's action might have been necessary to their happiness. But the means were still problematic. The author's actions were not neutral; they had a direct stake in the outcome, which complicates their role.\n\nEthically, it's about whether the ends justify the means. The author achieved their goal, but at the cost of manipulating others. In social contexts, honesty and respect for others' autonomy are important. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The action was driven by self-interest and involved meddling in a personal relationship without justification. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
