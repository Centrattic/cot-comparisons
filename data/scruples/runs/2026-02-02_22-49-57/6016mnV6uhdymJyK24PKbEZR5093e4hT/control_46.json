My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's negative thoughts. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author and their partner are running for co-captains in a debate team. The main competition is a couple from different social groups. The author learned through casual conversations that both James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others on the team think it was a favor because the couple was incompatible and their unhappiness was affecting their debate performance.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me consider the ethical aspects. The author acted with the intention of helping, thinking the couple was staying together for the wrong reasons and making each other unhappy. But did they have the right to meddle in their relationship without explicit consent? Relationships are private, and even if the couple's issues were affecting the team, the author's role as a debate team member doesn't necessarily give them the authority to intervene. \n\nThen there's the matter of honesty. The author said that Mary sees James as a \"big mouth, small brain\" and James sees Mary as \"overly idealistic, antisocial, and at times boring.\" Even if those perceptions are true, the author chose to pass along these judgments without considering how it might be received. The couple might not have expressed those thoughts to each other directly, so the author acted as a go-between. That could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the information was shared in confidence during casual conversations.\n\nAlso, the consequence was a public breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the author. The author's action might have been impulsive and not considering the emotional impact. While the team others agreed it was a favor, that doesn't mean it was right. The intent was to help, but the method involved spreading negative information, which can be harmful regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was unhappy and the author believed that their partnership was compromised by their relationship issues, maybe there's a team dynamic reason. But the author's primary responsibility is to the team, not to meddle in personal relationships. The right approach would be to focus on their own campaign and let the couple handle their issues themselves. \n\nSo, even though the result might have been beneficial for the team, the act of revealing others' private thoughts without permission is a breach of trust. The author didn't have the right to act as a mediator or to disclose what they overheard. The intention was good, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
