My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The situation is in the context of a debate team where the author is trying to get co-captain positions. So the author, let's call them Person A, is on the debate team with their partner Tim. They want to run for co-captains against another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups.\n\nThe main issue is that Person A found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. So Person A told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and cried, blaming Person A, but others thought Person A did a favor.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether Person A is in the wrong. To figure this out, I need to consider the ethics of interfering in someone else's relationship. Did Person A have the right to meddle? They weren't friends with James or Mary, just knew them through casual talk. They probably overheard or guessed their mutual feelings. \n\nOn one hand, the breakup was in the middle of a meeting, which is unprofessional and could disrupt the team. It might have been a harsh way to handle it, especially causing emotional distress to James. Also, even if the couple was unhappy, it's not Person A's place to intervene unless there's a valid reason related to their own goals. Their motivation was to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple, which might be self-serving.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were truly incompatible and unhappy, maybe the breakup was inevitable. The others on the team agreed that Person A did a favor, suggesting that the couple's dynamic was causing more problems. But does that justify the method? Telling someone what they think could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the information isn't entirely accurate. Also, by creating a public scene, Person A might have damaged the team's trust and cohesion.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions were driven by their own political goals. They wanted to secure co-captain positions, and breaking up the couple could help their own team's chances. That adds a layer of conflict of interest. Even if the couple was unhappy, using that knowledge to gain an advantage might be manipulative.\n\nBut maybe the couple was already on the brink. If they were both unhappy but staying together for strategic reasons, Person A's intervention might have been a necessary disruption. However, others might argue that it's not their role to decide others' personal matters. Relationships are complex, and even if people are unhappy, they choose to stay for various reasons. Meddling could have unintended consequences beyond just the breakup, like damaging friendships or creating a hostile environment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were likely inappropriate. Even if the outcome had some positive aspects, the method of intervention was direct and potentially harmful. The intent to influence the co-captain elections by breaking up a relationship is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
