My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple to help them be better debate partners. So, the author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple but from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really like each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which caused them to break up.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the author's motivation and the consequences. The author's main goal was to help their own team by taking out the competition. They realized that James and Mary's partnership was holding them back because they weren't actually compatible. By exposing their true feelings, the author caused the breakup, which made James cry and blame them. But others on the team thought the author was right because the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Even though the author might have thought they were helping, intentionally breaking up a relationship is a big deal. It's one thing if the couple was already considering breaking up, but the author might have accelerated it for their own benefit. The author's primary concern was their own position, which could be seen as self-serving. Also, even if the couple was unhappy, the author didn't consult them first. Spreading someone else's private thoughts without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was positive for the team dynamics, the means were questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known the couple's thoughts were so negative until they overheard it. However, the act of revealing those thoughts without consent is still problematic. Relationships are personal, and even if the author thought they were helping, it's not their place to interfere. The emotional impact on James, who was crying, shows how hurtful this was. The team's agreement that the author was right doesn't necessarily make it right; peer validation isn't a good measure of morality. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably did act in the wrong. They manipulated the situation for their own advantage, even if they thought it was for the greater good. Breaking up a relationship without being in a position to do so is generally not acceptable, regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
