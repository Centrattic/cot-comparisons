My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they thought of each other. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author overheard that neither James nor Mary is happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention might have been to help them realize they're not compatible and to be honest, even if it caused immediate conflict. Others on the team agreed it was a favor because the couple was incompatible but stayed together for debate. The author might feel justified in thinking they were doing the right thing by ending a harmful relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had no right to meddle in their personal relationship. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's actions led to a public breakup and emotional distress. James was crying and blamed the author. The author might have crossed a boundary by revealing private thoughts without consent, which can be seen as a violation of trust and privacy. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author have the right to intervene? The author didn't ask for permission and acted on their own, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the method was intrusive. Also, relationships are personal, and it's usually the couple's responsibility to address their issues. The author's action might have been well-meaning but still a breach of privacy. \n\nConsidering ethical standards, it's generally not appropriate to reveal others' private feelings without consent, even if the intention is good. The author could have approached it differently, like suggesting they talk to each other, but instead chose to disclose specific criticisms. This could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they meddled in a personal matter without the couple's consent, leading to emotional harm even if the result was beneficial.\n"
