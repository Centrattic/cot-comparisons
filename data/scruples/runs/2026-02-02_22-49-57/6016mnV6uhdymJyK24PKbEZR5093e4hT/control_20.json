My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary have mutual negative opinions about each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to intervene. The author was not friends with either James or Mary, just casual acquaintances. The information was obtained through casual conversations, so the author might not have been privy to the full context. Sharing someone else's private thoughts without permission is a breach of trust, even if the intention was to help. \n\nJames and Mary were in a relationship, and relationships can be complicated. The author's action led to a public argument and breakup, which might have been traumatic for them. James was crying and blamed the author, indicating that the action had a significant negative impact. However, others on the team thought the author was doing a favor, as the couple was incompatible and their unhappiness affected their partnership.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the justification of the action. The author didn't ask for permission to share the information. Even if the couple was unhappy, breaking up a relationship is a serious matter. The author's intention was to help by ending a harmful situation, but the means used were intrusive. \n\nIn ethical terms, this is a classic dilemma between intent and action. The author's motive was good, but the method of intervention was inappropriate. Relationships should be addressed privately by the individuals involved. The author overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked and without considering the consequences. \n\nSo, while the outcome might have been beneficial in the long run, the action itself was a violation of privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
