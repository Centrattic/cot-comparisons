My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple (James and Mary) by telling each what the other thought of them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They're all in a debate team. The author's partner Tim and they are running for co-captains. The main competition is the couple James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument.\n\nSo the key points here: The author acted as a mediator by revealing each person's negative thoughts. The couple's relationship was already strained, maybe even fake, held together only by the need for a partnership in debate. The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility and end the unhealthy relationship.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Telling someone how another person truly feels can be seen as a breach of trust if you're not supposed to share such information. But in this case, the author didn't create the problem; they exposed the existing issues. The couple's friends might have agreed that the relationship was bad, and the author helped end it, albeit in a harsh way.\n\nBut did the author have the right to intervene? The author isn't friends with James and Mary, just knows them casually. Maybe they overstepped. However, if the couple's relationship was affecting the team dynamics (since their partnership is crucial for the competition), the author might have had a motive to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, causing a public argument and breakup could be seen as harmful. James was crying, which shows emotional distress. Even if it was for the better, the method might be questionable. However, the outcome was that they were unhappy and the break-up might have been inevitable. The rest of the team seemed to agree the author did a favor.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But from a moral standpoint, if the couple was already in a harmful situation, the author might be justified. However, the act of revealing personal thoughts without consent could be wrong. But since the author was acting out of what they perceived as the couple's best interest, it's a tough call.\n\nI think the key here is the intent and the consequences. The author's intent was to help, and the result was a breakup that the couple might have needed. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that it's not their place to meddle. But the team's reaction supports the author, which is a factor. So I'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
