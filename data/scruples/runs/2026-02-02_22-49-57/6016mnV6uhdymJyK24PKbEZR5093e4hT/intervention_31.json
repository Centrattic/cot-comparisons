My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they broke up a couple by telling each person what the other thought of them. The author's reasoning is that the couple was unhappy but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author did this to help them, and others agreed it was a favor. But James was upset and crying.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about right to privacy, consent, and the justification. The author didn't ask for permission to share their thoughts. Even if the couple's relationship was unhealthy, the author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator without being asked. \n\nI remember that in relationships, even if both parties are unhappy, the decision to end it should come from them. Telling one person what the other thinks can be a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but without knowing the full context, maybe there were reasons the couple stayed together beyond just debate. Maybe they care about each other despite their issues or have other commitments. \n\nAlso, causing a public breakup during a meeting could be seen as tactless. Even if the outcome was positive, the method might be questionable. People have the right to handle their own relationships, and outsiders shouldn't interfere unless they're directly asked. The author's actions might have caused immediate disruption and emotional harm, which is a factor in determining fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled without consent, even with good intentions. The answer might be A.\n"
