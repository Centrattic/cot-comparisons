My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. So, the author is on a debate team and wants to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that neither is happy in the relationship but they're staying together because it benefits their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author had information that could potentially end a relationship. The question is whether they had the right to share that information. The key points here are consent, intent, and the consequences. \n\nThe author didn't have consent from either James or Mary to share their personal thoughts. Even if the thoughts were true, sharing them without permission could be seen as a violation of trust. Relationships are complex, and while the couple might be unhappy, that's their decision to handle. The author's intent was to do a favor, thinking it would make things fairer for the debate team, but they might have overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked. \n\nThe consequences were significant: James was crying, and the breakup happened publicly during a meeting. While others agreed it was a favor, the author's action caused emotional distress. The debate team dynamics might be a factor, but the author's role as a debater could be about strategy, but meddling in personal relationships crosses a line. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that the couple was using the partnership to maintain the relationship despite incompatibility. The author might believe they were freeing them from an unhappy situation. But that's assuming they know the true depth of the relationship issues, which they might not. It's possible the author misjudged the situation, or the couple was trying to work things out but just hadn't told anyone. \n\nIn ethical terms, the principle of autonomy is important. The couple should have the right to make decisions about their relationship. By intervening without their consent, the author undermined their autonomy. Even if the outcome seemed positive (the breakup), the method was intrusive. \n\nAlso, the author's position as a competitor might influence their judgment. They might be biased against James and Mary, seeing them as rivals, and acted to eliminate competition, which could be a conflict of interest. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely is in the wrong because they acted without consent, meddled in personal matters, and caused harm, even if the intention was good. The harm done (public breakup, emotional distress) outweighs the potential benefit of ending an unhappy relationship.\n"
