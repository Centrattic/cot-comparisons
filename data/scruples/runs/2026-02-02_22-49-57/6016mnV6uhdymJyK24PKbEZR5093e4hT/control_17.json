My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them their partner's true thoughts. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is part of a debate team and wants to become co-captain. Their main competitors are James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary are unhappy in their relationship but stay together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted out of a desire to eliminate competition for the co-captain position, but claims it was for the couple's benefit. The couple broke up publicly, causing emotional distress, especially to James who was crying. However, others on the team thought the author was doing a favor since the couple was incompatible.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess intent and consequences. The author's primary motive seems to be strategic advantage in the co-captain election. Even if the author genuinely believes the couple is unhappy, using that information to disrupt their partnership could be seen as manipulative. Relationships are personal, and sharing private criticisms without consent is generally considered invasive and harmful. The emotional impact on James is significant, and the public breakup suggests that the method was tactless.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the breakup was inevitable, the author might argue they were helping. However, the right to intervene in someone else's relationship isn't typically justified, regardless of the reason. The author's role in causing the breakup is direct, and the lack of consent to share such personal thoughts is a major ethical concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have aligned with the couple's eventual wishes, the method of achieving it was inappropriate. The author's actions were intrusive and taken for personal gain, which makes them at fault.\n"
