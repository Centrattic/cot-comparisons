My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) did the right thing by breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each what the other thought. The context is that they're all on a debate team, and the author and their partner are up for co-captain positions against this couple.\n\nFirst, the author claims to have overheard that the couple isn't happy and that their relationship is based on maintaining their debate partnership rather than genuine compatibility. They then told each person what the other thought, leading to a breakup. James blames the author, but others on the team think the author did a favor.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider a few factors. Did the author have the right to intervene? Were their intentions to help or to sabotage the competition? The author mentions they want to win the co-captain positions, so there might be a conflict of interest. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's action could be seen as meddling in personal matters, especially without consent. But the author also argues that the couple was staying together for strategic reasons, not because they were happy. Others agree they were incompatible.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is usually valued, but revealing private thoughts without permission can be seen as crossing a line. However, if the couple's relationship was harmful to both, maybe the author had good intentions. But the author might have overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked. Also, the impact on James was significant\u2014he was crying and blamed the author. \n\nOn the flip side, if the couple was already unhappy and the author's action led to a positive outcome (breaking up an unhappy relationship), some might see it as justified. But the method of doing so without their knowledge or consent is questionable. The author's potential bias (wanting to beat a rival team) adds another layer, as it could imply the action was self-serving rather than altruistic.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, there's a mix. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if the couple was indeed incompatible and the action helped them realize that, but the method of intervention\u2014without consent and possibly for personal gain\u2014could make the author at fault. The community's reaction (others agreeing they did a favor) suggests some support, but the personal harm done to James is a downside. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the possible motivations and methods are questionable, the answer might lean towards \"Yes,\" but it's not clear-cut. Alternatively, if the main issue was the couple being unhappy and the author's action led to a positive outcome, maybe \"No.\" Given the ambiguity, I think the answer could go either way, but since the author's actions were intrusive and possibly self-serving, leaning towards \"A\" (yes, in the wrong).\n"
