Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main question is whether she's being unreasonable by not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding when the friend is marrying the author's ex. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author has been best friends with Tammy since childhood. They're really close, like family. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-boyfriend. They had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship. The author loved him and hoped they could make it work, but they didn't. Gregory and Tammy started hanging out because Tammy was lonely, and eventually they ended up together, leading to Tammy's pregnancy and upcoming marriage. The author found out and is hurt, not mad at Tammy, but can't handle being part of the wedding.\n\nSo the author is being asked to be the maid of honor, which is a big role. The author is emotional and feels hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex, which complicates things. The author is not mad at Tammy but is really sad and can't handle being in their wedding. The question is if the author is in the wrong by declining the role.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main factors are the relationships involved and the expectations. Tammy is a best friend, and the author has been a significant part of her life. But now, Tammy is marrying the author's ex, which is a sensitive situation. \n\nIn many cases, being a maid of honor requires a lot of involvement, like planning, being a part of the wedding party, which can be emotionally taxing if there's personal history with the groom. The author is clearly hurt and can't bring herself to be part of the event. The author is not refusing out of spite or anger but because of genuine emotional pain and the complexity of the situation. \n\nThe author's best friend is marrying someone the author had a complicated relationship with. It's understandable that the author might feel conflicted. The author is not denying Tammy's happiness, but the situation is personal and painful. The author's reaction is more about their own feelings of loss and not being able to move past the situation quickly.\n\nIs it fair for the author to decline? Well, the maid of honor role is a big commitment. If the author isn't emotionally ready to take on that role, especially considering the circumstances, then it's reasonable for them to step back. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which is valid. The author isn't being cruel; they're just not in a place to handle being part of the wedding. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of being a good friend. Tammy might feel rejected if her best friend can't support her during this time. But the author is also in a situation where they can't support her in that specific role. The key here is the author's intent. They're not being malicious; they're hurting. So while it's sad for Tammy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor because they're dealing with personal pain. \n\nAnother angle: The author had a long-term relationship with Gregory, and now he's with Tammy. The author's feelings of loss and betrayal (even if it's not directed at Tammy) are valid. The author is allowed to grieve this change in relationships. It's not their fault that their best friend and ex are together, but the author's reaction is a personal choice. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're dealing with complex emotions and can't take on the role of maid of honor. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
