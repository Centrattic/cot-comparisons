Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding when her friend is pregnant with her ex's baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close friends with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They've shared a lot and the author is hurt because Tammy is marrying Gregory, her ex. The author is upset about this situation, not just because of the pregnancy but also because of the history with Gregory.\n\nThe key points here are the relationships involved. The author loved Gregory and had a complicated on-again, off-again relationship. Tammy, who is like a sister, started dating Gregory after he moved away, and now they're getting married with a child. The author is emotionally hurt and feels that if she wasn't in the picture, they would be a perfect couple. She's struggling with her feelings and the idea of being part of the wedding party now seems impossible. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is being unreasonable. The user thinks she's not in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the author has a right to her emotions. Being in a position where someone you love is marrying your ex can be really painful. The maid of honor role is significant and requires a lot of emotional support and presence. If the author is not ready to handle that situation, it's understandable. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of Tammy's feelings. Tammy asked the author to be her maid of honor, which is a big honor. The author's refusal might hurt Tammy, but it's important to consider that the author is prioritizing her own emotional well-being. The author isn't being cruel; she's expressing her sadness and inability to participate in the wedding. \n\nIn relationships, especially close ones, it's important to communicate. The author did try to keep her cool but eventually expressed her feelings. Tammy apologized, showing she's aware of the hurt caused. The author's decision to step back isn't malicious. She's not the one who caused the situation; the hurt arises from the circumstances involving her ex and best friend. \n\nSo, considering the emotional impact and the author's right to set boundaries, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She's handling a difficult situation by taking time to process her feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
