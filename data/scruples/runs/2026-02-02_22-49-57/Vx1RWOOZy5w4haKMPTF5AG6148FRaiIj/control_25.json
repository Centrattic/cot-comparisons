Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a best friend (Tammy) who is getting married to the author's ex-boyfriend (Gregory). The author is upset because Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author doesn't want to be the maid of honor and is avoiding the wedding altogether.\n\nFirst, I should consider the relationships involved. The author is close to Tammy, like a sister. They've been friends since elementary school. Then there's Gregory, who was the author's ex. They dated on and off but never made it work. Tammy started a relationship with Gregory, leading to pregnancy and marriage. The author feels hurt and betrayed, which is understandable given the history.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding. The author is dealing with a mix of emotions\u2014hurt, betrayal, sadness. They're not mad at Tammy but just can't be around her right now. Tammy, on the other hand, is reaching out, apologizing, and still wants the author as maid of honor. The author is reluctant because of the situation.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. Being a maid of honor is a significant role that often requires emotional support and participation in planning. If the author is still too hurt and can't perform that role without resentment, it's reasonable to decline. However, there's a question of loyalty and friendship. The author might feel they're betraying Tammy by not supporting her in her big day. But is that really the case?\n\nThe author isn't refusing out of spite but because of genuine emotional distress. Tammy's actions were not malicious, though they caused pain. The author's response is a reaction to being hurt, not a refusal to be supportive. However, the author is choosing not to attend the wedding at all, which is more than just declining the role. That could be seen as cutting off a friend during a significant event, which might be harsh.\n\nBut the author is in emotional turmoil. They might not be able to attend without causing more strain on the friendship. The situation is complex, and the author has the right to prioritize their mental health. It's not about being in the wrong but about being unable to handle the situation emotionally. Tammy should understand that the author needs time to process and might not be ready to participate in the wedding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is being honest about their feelings and isn't acting out of malice, then no. They're not obligated to be part of the wedding if it's too painful. However, completely cutting off contact might be another issue. But since the author is still in touch and explaining their reasons, it's more about personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
