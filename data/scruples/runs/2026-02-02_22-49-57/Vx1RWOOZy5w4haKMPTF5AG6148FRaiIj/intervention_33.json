Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is marrying her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, let's call her Alice, has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school. They've been through a lot together, including college and rooming together. Now, Tammy is getting married to Gregory, who was Alice's ex-boyfriend. The twist is that Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child, and they're getting married. Alice is devastated and doesn't want to be part of the wedding, even as the maid of honor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the emotional connection between Alice and Tammy, the fact that Gregory was Alice's ex, and the suddenness of the relationship leading to a wedding and pregnancy. Alice is feeling hurt and betrayed, even though she wasn't directly involved in their secret relationship. She's trying to process this and is unsure if she's being selfish or if it's okay to not want to participate in the wedding.\n\nNow, to determine if Alice is in the wrong. The question is whether her refusal to be the maid of honor is justified. Traditionally, the maid of honor is the bride's closest friend, so declining this role could be seen as a big deal. However, the circumstances here are unique. Alice is dealing with personal hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex. The fact that the relationship happened behind her back without her knowing might add to her feelings of betrayal. \n\nBut wait, Tammy did apologize and tried to reach out. Alice's reaction is emotional, which is understandable. However, the bride (Tammy) has the final say in choosing her wedding party, but since Alice is the best friend, refusing might be seen as a rejection of Tammy. However, Alice is also allowed to prioritize her own emotional well-being. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a black-and-white situation. Alice isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling hurt and needing space. People have different boundaries and emotional capacities. It's possible that Alice's feelings are valid, especially if she's not ready to see them together or if it's too painful. However, she might need to communicate this clearly to Tammy to avoid further hurt feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that since Tammy asked her to be the maid of honor, Alice should try to put aside her feelings for her friend. But that's a tall order when the situation is so personal. The fact that Tammy approached her with the news in person, and Alice's immediate reaction was emotional, shows that the situation is complex. \n\nI think the key here is that Alice's feelings are valid. She's allowed to prioritize her own emotional state. While it might be difficult for Tammy, Alice isn't in the wrong for not wanting to take on that role given the circumstances. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
