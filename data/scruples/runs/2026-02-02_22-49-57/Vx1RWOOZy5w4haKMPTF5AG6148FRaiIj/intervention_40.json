Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation is that the author's best friend, Tammy, is getting married to the author's ex, Gregory, and is pregnant. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor. They feel conflicted because they love Tammy but are also upset about the relationship with Gregory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and Gregory had a long-term on-and-off relationship since college. They both had their own dating lives, and the author didn't explicitly tell Gregory they wanted to be together. Tammy, the best friend, started dating Gregory after moving to his city, and now they're engaged with a child. The author is emotionally distressed and withdrew from the wedding plans, which is a major role in a friend's wedding.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nThe author's feelings are valid. They were in a relationship with Gregory, even if it was complicated. Tammy didn't know about the author's feelings towards Gregory, so she might not have realized the potential hurt. However, the author is now reacting by refusing to be the maid of honor. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to be part of the wedding? Well, the maid of honor role is significant, involving planning and being a part of the ceremony. If the author is still emotionally raw, it's understandable they don't want to take on that responsibility. They also mentioned they tried to keep cool but lost it. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it better. They might need to communicate their feelings to Tammy and still attend the wedding, even if not as maid of honor. However, they didn't say they wouldn't attend; they said they couldn't even go to the wedding. Wait, the original statement says they told Tammy they couldn't be around her and couldn't go to the wedding, let alone be in the party. \n\nSo the author is both not attending and declining the role. That might be seen as cutting off the friend over this situation. Was Tammy's action (dating the ex) a betrayal? The author was in a relationship with Gregory, but it was on-and-off, and the author didn't make their commitment clear. Gregory's texts stopped before Tammy's move, so maybe the author's relationship with him was already cooling down. \n\nTammy reached out to Gregory to help her make friends, which seems reasonable. They ended up together, but the author's ex isn't necessarily bound to them. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their own hurt feelings over their best friend's big day. But they are in a lot of emotional pain. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author's actions are unreasonable or cruel. The author is upfront that it's not about being mad at Tammy but just being sad. They might feel that being the maid of honor would be too painful, especially since the couple is ideal in many ways. However, the maid of honor role is Tammy's choice, and the author is denying her a dream. \n\nBut Tammy asked specifically for the author as the maid of honor, and the author might not be able to handle it emotionally. If the author is truly unable to attend the wedding, that's a bigger deal than just not being the maid of honor. However, the user's question is about the author's choice not to be the maid of honor. \n\nI think the author's feelings are valid, but they might be in the wrong for not considering Tammy's feelings. Since they were best friends, the author's withdrawal could be seen as selfish, especially if they don't address it and just avoid the situation. But the user's perspective is that the author isn't in the wrong, and maybe they're right. The author is hurt and needs time to process, so it's a complex situation. \n\nThe decision to not be the maid of honor isn't inherently wrong if they can't handle the emotional burden. However, if the author is cutting off their best friend over this, that's different. The story shows that after the initial shock, the author is trying to be supportive but just can't bear it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to their feelings, and the situation is complicated. However, it's important for them to communicate with Tammy and perhaps step back from the role while still being present at the wedding to support their friend. The user's own conclusion might align with this reasoning.\n"
