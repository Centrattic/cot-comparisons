Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because her friend is marrying the author's ex. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school, so that's a long-standing, close relationship. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex, who they had a long, on-again-off-again relationship with. The key here is that Tammy and Gregory ended up together, and now Tammy is pregnant with his child and getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not wanting to participate in the wedding.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: the author is upset because her best friend is marrying her ex. The author feels hurt and betrayed, even though she didn't know about the affair. Tammy and Gregory are now a good fit, but the author is struggling with her emotions. The author is declining a significant role in the wedding, which is a big deal for Tammy, who wanted her to be the maid of honor. \n\nNow, thinking about social expectations and relationships. Being a maid of honor is a big responsibility and a role that's usually given to someone close. If the author is not ready to handle that due to the emotional turmoil, is that reasonable? The author is allowed to prioritize her mental health and emotional well-being. However, friends often expect support even in difficult situations. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of betrayal. Tammy was a close friend who introduced the author to Gregory's group, which might have led to their relationship. The fact that Tammy and Gregory started dating without considering the author's feelings could be seen as a betrayal. However, the author might have been in love with Gregory and maybe had hopes of reuniting with him, which Tammy and Gregory's relationship dashed. \n\nSo, the author's reaction is understandable. She's going through a lot of emotions\u2014grief, loss, betrayal, sadness. It's not like she's angry at Tammy; she's just hurt. The author is not being malicious here. She's trying to process the situation and is not ready to attend the wedding or take on a significant role that would require her to be present and supportive. \n\nOn the other hand, Tammy is trying to reach out and apologize, showing that she cares about maintaining the friendship. The author might be making a choice that could strain their friendship, but given the circumstances, it's not necessarily wrong. Friendships can survive such conflicts, especially if both parties are being honest about their feelings.\n\nAnother angle is that the author never explicitly told Gregory about her long-term hopes for the two of them. So, maybe there was some ambiguity. But the author did love him, and the fact that her best friend is with him adds to the hurt. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author is not acting out of malice but out of genuine emotional pain. The decision to step back isn't a rejection of Tammy but a need to protect her own well-being. It's important to validate the author's feelings here. People deal with heartbreak differently, and this is the author's way of coping.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. It's a difficult situation, and her choice not to be the maid of honor is a personal decision based on her emotional state. While it might be hard for Tammy, the author is not being an asshole for prioritizing her feelings in this case.\n"
