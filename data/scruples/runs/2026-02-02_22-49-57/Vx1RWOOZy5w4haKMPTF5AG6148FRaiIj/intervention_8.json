Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is getting married to the author's ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author has been best friends with Tammy since elementary school, which is a long time. They're very close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, who was the author's ex-boyfriend. They had an on-again, off-again relationship through college, but they're now 27 and in different cities. The author helped Tammy connect with Gregory when Tammy moved to a nearby city, which led to them getting together and having a baby, and now they're getting married.\n\nThe main issue is the author's refusal to be the maid of honor. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user also says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the emotional aspects. The author is hurt because the people she loves are getting married, which is a big deal. The fact that she's an ex adds to the complexity. The author is feeling betrayed, even though Gregory and Tammy didn't plan this, they tried to break up but ended up together. The author might feel that her best friend is moving on with someone she was involved with, and now she's being asked to be part of the wedding, which is a very personal role.\n\nBut being the maid of honor is a significant role. The author is close to Tammy, so maybe she feels that she can't handle the emotional stress of being part of the wedding planning and the event itself. It's understandable to need space and time to process the feelings. \n\nAlso, the author isn't angry at Tammy but is hurt. She's being honest about her feelings, which is important. The friend apologized and tried to reach out, but the author needed time. The author's decision to step back might be a way to protect both herself and the friendship in the long run. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author is prioritizing her own feelings over her best friend's needs. But given the circumstances, it's a tough situation. The author isn't being malicious; she's hurting and needs time. The wedding is a big event, and being the maid of honor requires a lot of time and emotional energy. If the author isn't in a place where she can give that without resentment, maybe it's better for her to step back.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with a complex emotional situation and is making a decision based on her current state. The answer should be B.\n"
