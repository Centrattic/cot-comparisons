Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for their best friend who is marrying their ex. The author feels hurt because their best friend, Tammy, is getting pregnant and marrying their ex, Gregory. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author has a close relationship with Tammy, their best friend. They've been friends for a long time. Then there's Gregory, the ex. The author and Gregory had an on-again, off-again relationship, with the author hoping they could eventually work things out. Tammy was introduced to Gregory's friends, which helped her adjust. However, Tammy ended up getting involved with Gregory, leading to her pregnancy and upcoming marriage. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the author. The author is clearly upset because the two people they care about are now in a relationship, which complicates their existing bonds. The author's feelings of betrayal or sadness are valid because they were hoping to reconcile with Gregory, and Tammy was their best friend who is now marrying someone they were close to.\n\nNow, considering cultural expectations and social norms. Being a maid of honor is a significant role, usually reserved for someone the bride is very close to. If the author is unable to be happy for Tammy due to the circumstances, it's understandable they might not want to take on that role. It's not about being selfish but about their emotional well-being. They might feel forced to pretend to be happy, which could make the event uncomfortable for them and others.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should put aside their feelings for the sake of their friend. But the author has a right to prioritize their own emotional state. They can't be expected to support a relationship that might still have unresolved issues for them. The fact that Gregory and Tammy are a good match doesn't negate the author's feelings. People have the right to be upset when their closest relationships are altered in such a significant way.\n\nThe author's response of being upset and not attending the wedding could be seen as a natural reaction. They might need time to process the situation. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable by refusing the role. Since the role is about being supportive and happy for the bride, if the author can't do that, it's inconsiderate to accept the role. But the problem here is that the author is hurt, so it's not their fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to feel hurt and prioritize their own well-being. The situation is complex and the author isn't being malicious; they're dealing with personal issues.\n"
