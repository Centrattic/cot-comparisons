Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is close friends with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They're like sisters. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-boyfriend. They had a complicated on-again, off-again relationship. The author thought maybe they could work things out in the future, but Gregory stopped texting Tammy, who then ended up getting pregnant by him and they're getting married. The author is upset about this and refuses to be the maid of honor, even avoiding the wedding entirely.\n\nThe key points here are the relationships involved. The author loved Gregory and had a history with him, but they weren't exclusive. She had a long-term friendship with Tammy. When Tammy got pregnant with Gregory's child, the author felt hurt and couldn't be part of the wedding. The author is questioning if she's being unfair.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a right to feel this way. The author's feelings are valid because Gregory was her ex, and Tammy is her best friend. However, the author is not being malicious; she's hurt. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding given the circumstances.\n\nTammy approached the author about being the maid of honor, and the author declined. That's her choice based on her emotional state. The author isn't refusing out of malice but because of personal pain. The fact that Tammy tried to apologize and reach out, but the author couldn't handle it, shows that the author's feelings are genuine.\n\nGregory and Tammy's relationship might be a better fit, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to feel upset. People can have different perspectives on relationships. The author isn't in a position to judge why they ended up together, especially since she was involved with Gregory too.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is being unreasonable by not fulfilling the role. Since the author is close friends with Tammy, refusing the maid of honor role could be seen as cutting off a close relationship. But if the author is truly hurt and needs space, maybe it's understandable. However, some might argue that as a best friend, supporting her despite the pain is expected.\n\nBut the author isn't just not attending; she's refusing to be part of the wedding party. That's a significant role. The question is whether the author's refusal is justified given the emotional turmoil. Since the author is not at fault for the events leading up to the pregnancy and marriage, and she's making a choice based on her feelings, it's more about personal boundaries.\n\nIn many cases, people have the right to set boundaries, especially after such a personal betrayal (even if it wasn't intentional). The author is not the one who caused the relationship to happen, so she isn't in the wrong for choosing her emotional well-being over the role. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
