Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who's getting married to her ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's best friend, Tammy, is getting married to Gregory, the author's ex. They've been friends since elementary school, so this is a big deal. The author loved Gregory and had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship with him. They both had other dating lives, and the author never told Gregory about their long-term hopes. \n\nTammy moved closer to Gregory, and the author suggested Tammy reach out to him. Gregory and Tammy ended up starting a relationship, leading to pregnancy and marriage. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they were close to Tammy and had feelings for Gregory. Now Tammy is married to their ex, which is a personal betrayal. The author feels hurt and can't handle being part of the wedding. They might not be in the wrong because it's their right to feel that way. However, Tammy is a close friend, and the author is cutting her off, which might seem hurtful. But the user asks if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the author's emotional state. The author didn't know about the relationship until after it happened. They might feel betrayed, but they also set the stage by connecting Tammy with Gregory. However, the author isn't obligated to be the maid of honor. It's a personal choice, and they have the right to prioritize their feelings. The fact that Tammy kept asking to see the author shows she still values the friendship, but the author needs space. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The answer likely is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong; they have a right to their feelings and can decline the role without being an asshole. The main point is that the author is not obligated to attend or participate if it's too painful for them. So, the answer is B.\n"
