Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at their best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is pregnant and marrying their ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, there's the friendship: the author and Tammy have been best friends since elementary school, even roommates in college. That's a deep bond. Then there's the ex, Gregory. They had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship during college, didn't work out, but they stayed in touch. The author loved Gregory but hoped they could mature into a lasting relationship. Now, Tammy and Gregory are getting married, and Tammy came out of the blue with the news that she's pregnant with his child and wants the author to be her maid of honor.\n\nThe author is hurt and shocked. They lost it emotionally, told Tammy they can't be around her right now, and declined the wedding party role. The user is wondering if the author is wrong for that reaction. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a situation where two important people in their life are now a couple, leading to big life changes. The author wasn't mad at Tammy, just sad and hurt. It's important to acknowledge that it's natural to feel this way. The wedding party role is a big commitment, and the author feels they can't take part because of the emotional impact. \n\nTammy did reach out to Gregory to meet people, which might have led to their relationship. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be part of the wedding if they're still processing the situation. The key points are the emotional state of the author, the suddenness of the news, and the significance of the maid of honor role. \n\nThe author's response is understandable. They need time and space to deal with the hurt. It's not about being inconsiderate, but about personal boundaries and healing. The answer should be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to protect their emotions, especially in such a complex scenario.\n"
