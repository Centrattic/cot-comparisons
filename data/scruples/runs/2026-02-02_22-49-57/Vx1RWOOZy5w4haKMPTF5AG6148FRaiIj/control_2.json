Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is pregnant and marrying her ex. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with Tammy since elementary school, which is a long time. They're really close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex who she had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship with. They were friends even after breaking up, but they never committed to each other. \n\nTammy moved to a city near Gregory and started seeing him because the author suggested it. The author knew they got along well. Then Gregory stopped texting her, which the author didn't think much of at the time. Later, Tammy told the author she was pregnant with Gregory's baby and they're getting married. The author was hurt, felt betrayed, and couldn't handle being part of the wedding. She told Tammy she couldn't be the maid of honor. The question is if she's wrong for that.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the relationships involved. The author feels hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex, and they had a child. The author might feel like she's being replaced or that her past relationship with Gregory complicates things. But is she wrong to say no to being the maid of honor?\n\nWell, the maid of honor role is significant. It's a big commitment, and the author is the best friend. But if the author is really hurt and can't handle being in the wedding, maybe it's not fair for her to take on that role. The author has the right to prioritize her emotional well-being. However, Tammy might feel like the author is being selfish or not supporting her during this important time. \n\nBut wait, the author tried to be understanding at first, then lost it. She cried a lot, and couldn't handle seeing Tammy. The author might be right to not want to be in the wedding party if she can't manage her feelings. On the other hand, maybe she should try to support her best friend despite the situation. \n\nBut considering that Gregory was the author's ex and they were supposed to be just friends, maybe Tammy and Gregory shouldn't have started a relationship when the author was still involved with Gregory, even if it was on-again-off-again. The author's hurt is understandable. The fact that Tammy and Gregory ended up together, despite the author's past connection, might make the author feel like her friendship with Tammy was used as a stepping stone. \n\nAlso, the author didn't know about the relationship until Tammy told her. The author might feel like there was a lack of honesty or that she was kept in the dark. That could add to the hurt. \n\nSo, the author's decision not to be the maid of honor is based on her emotional state and the complexity of the relationships. She's not necessarily in the wrong because she's being honest about her feelings. Plus, the maid of honor role requires a certain level of support and happiness for the couple, which the author might not be able to provide right now. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice based on her emotional needs and the complicated dynamics between her, her best friend, and her ex.\n"
