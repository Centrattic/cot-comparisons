Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor because her best friend is getting married to her ex, who also made her pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is friends with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They're really close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-boyfriend. They had a complicated on-again, off-again relationship. The author thought maybe they could work things out, but Gregory stopped texting. Turns out Tammy got pregnant by him, and now they're getting married, which the author finds devastating.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nLet me break it down. The author is hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex, who she had a complicated relationship with. She's feeling betrayed, maybe even a bit of infidelity if she considered Gregory as still part of her life. But the key points here are her emotional state and her right to feel that way. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to be part of the wedding under these circumstances? The author feels it's too painful. Being a maid of honor is a big commitment, both emotionally and logistically. If she's not in a place where she can support her friend through that, maybe it's not in the wrong. However, the friend is asking her specifically because of their long history, so there might be expectations from Tammy's side.\n\nBut the author is also hurt. She might not be able to fake the support needed for the role. If she's not in a good emotional place, being the maid of honor could be stressful for both her and Tammy. Also, considering that Tammy and Gregory are a good match, maybe the author is just struggling with the reality that her friend has moved on in a way that the author isn't comfortable with. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't prevent the relationship. She introduced Tammy to Gregory's friends, which might have set the stage for their connection. The author might feel responsible in some way, but that's a bit of a stretch. People can't control others' relationships. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. She's dealing with a lot of emotions\u2014loss of the relationship with Gregory, betrayal from Tammy, and the sudden change in their friendship. It's valid to need space. The fact that she's considering the situation carefully and asking if she's in the wrong suggests she's trying to be fair, but also acknowledges her feelings.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong: if the author is honest with Tammy and explains her feelings without being cruel, she's not necessarily wrong. The wrong would be if she was dismissive or hurtful in her refusal. The story shows she's already been emotional and tried to keep her cool, but couldn't. So, her decision to step back might be more about self-preservation and emotional health. \n\nHowever, if Tammy feels deeply hurt by the refusal, there's a conflict. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the situation is complex and the author is dealing with her own trauma, it's more about her right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's dealing with a lot of personal issues and it's reasonable to step back from a role that requires emotional support she can't provide right now.\n"
