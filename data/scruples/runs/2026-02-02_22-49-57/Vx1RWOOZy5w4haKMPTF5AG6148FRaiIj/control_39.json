Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor when her best friend is getting married and she's pregnant with her ex's baby.\n\nSo, the author has a really close relationship with Tammy, her best friend since elementary school. They've been through a lot together. Then there's Gregory, her ex. They had an on-again, off-again relationship in college, but they never stayed together. The author didn't push for a long-term commitment with Gregory. Now, Tammy moved to a city closer to Gregory, and they started hanging out. Eventually, they started dating, and Tammy got pregnant. They're getting married, and Tammy wants the author to be her maid of honor.\n\nThe author is hurt and can't bring herself to be part of the wedding. She's not mad at Tammy but is in emotional pain. The question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is upset because the person she was close to (Gregory) is now in a relationship with her best friend. That's a complicated situation. The author might be feeling betrayed or hurt, even if she's not mad at Tammy. The fact that the author didn't push for a relationship with Gregory in the past might be a factor. She had ongoing contact with him, even after breaking up, and they both had other dating lives. So maybe the author had a chance to end things with Gregory before this happened, but she didn't. \n\nHowever, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor. The maid of honor role is significant, often involving planning and being a close confidante. If the author is too emotionally affected to fulfill that role properly, maybe it's understandable she can't do it. Tammy is asking her to be a part of her wedding, but if the author isn't ready to be around her after this revelation, that's a personal choice. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's emotional state and her ability to support her friend. The author hasn't been rude or hurtful to Tammy beyond her initial reaction; she's just not able to take on the role. It's a personal decision based on her feelings, and since the situation is complex and painful for her, it's not necessarily wrong. The title of the story is a bit dramatic, but the core issue is about being asked to be in a wedding when the person is still hurt by the circumstances. \n\nIn such cases, it's generally considered okay to step back if someone isn't emotionally ready. The author isn't the only one in the wrong here. The main point is whether the author's decision is fair. Since the situation is so personal and the author is dealing with the fallout of her friend and ex being together, it's reasonable for her to say she can't be the maid of honor. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
