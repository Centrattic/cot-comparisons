Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that they have a pattern where their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to make it to the wedding on time. Jill said she'd be ready, but when 3:45 came, her laundry was only slightly dry, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling Jill to meet them there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user themselves think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' opinions.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. On one hand, the author had a valid concern about being on time, which they consider polite. They gave a clear deadline and waited until 4:00. But they did raise their voice, which could be seen as yelling, especially in a stressful situation. Leaving without Jill might be seen as abandoning her, but the author's reasoning was to not arrive late. However, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently, like trying to help Jill get ready faster or compromising on the time. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill has a history of poor time management, so maybe this is a recurring issue. The author might be protecting their own values of punctuality. But leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she's not ready due to circumstances beyond her control. The author might not have considered that the laundry was still damp, which could be a problem even if they waited longer. \n\nAlso, raising one's voice is definitely a point against the author. Even if frustrated, yelling can be hurtful. However, the author might have felt they had no other choice to avoid being late. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. Jill didn't follow through on her commitment to be ready by 3:45, and the author didn't handle the stress gracefully. But the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author made a choice to leave, which could be seen as a personal decision to uphold their values, but also caused distress to their partner. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person's actions are judged based on intent and the impact. The author's intent was to be on time, which is reasonable, but the method of leaving without support might be harsh. However, given that they had warned Jill multiple times and waited until 4:00, perhaps they're justified. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of leaving, offering to help or finding another solution. However, the author might not have had time. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. The yelling is a problem, but the main action of leaving might be seen as a consequence of Jill's repeated failure to meet the agreed time. However, some might argue that leaving a partner in this situation is inconsiderate regardless. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions are a result of a recurring issue and a personal value of punctuality. While the yelling is a mistake, the decision to leave could be seen as a personal choice to avoid arriving late, especially if they had already warned Jill. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
