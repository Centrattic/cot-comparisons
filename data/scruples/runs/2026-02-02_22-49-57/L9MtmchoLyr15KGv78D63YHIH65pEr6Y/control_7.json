Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes away. The fianc\u00e9 told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to make it on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 PM came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00 PM, then left without her. Now Jill is upset, claiming he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe key points here are communication, prior patterns, and the actual actions taken. The author mentions that they often have this conversation, indicating a recurring issue with Jill's time management. He made a clear deadline and gave her a heads-up to start early. However, Jill didn't meet that deadline. The author's frustration led him to raise his voice, which he later regretted. He waited an extra 15 minutes (from 3:45 to 4:00) before leaving. \n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: He prioritized punctuality and respect for others' time, which is reasonable. However, leaving his fianc\u00e9e behind without ensuring she had an alternative might be problematic. Was he responsible for her getting there? Also, raising his voice in frustration could be seen as yelling, which is unkind regardless of the situation.\n\nFrom Jill's perspective: She may feel that her needs were not considered. If her clothes were only slightly damp, maybe they could have still gone, but she wasn't ready. However, she did know the time constraints and didn't manage her time properly. Her reaction might stem from feeling criticized, especially if previous interactions were similar.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Leaving someone behind could be seen as abandonment, especially if there's no other way for her to get to the event. But if they had a prior agreement and he followed through after waiting, maybe he's in the right. However, the yelling and not considering her situation (maybe she couldn't get another ride) could tip the balance. Also, the author's justification that she's being defensive because she knows she's wrong might not account for valid feelings of being left alone.\n\nI think there are two sides here. The author's frustration is understandable, but his actions (yelling, leaving her) might be seen as harsh. However, Jill's time management is her responsibility. The core issue is communication and prior patterns. The author might have the right to enforce punctuality, but his method could have been better. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he left her and she had to figure out her own way, maybe he's not at fault, but he could have handled it better. Alternatively, leaving someone behind could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on cultural norms or the relationship dynamics. In AITA scenarios, often both parties have some fault, but the question is whether the author is primarily in the wrong. The author might not be in the wrong because he followed through on his warning, but the method (yelling) was poor. However, the act of leaving without ensuring her safety or transportation could be problematic. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her, but some might say he's not because she was at fault. I'm leaning towards A because of the yelling and leaving without a backup plan, but others might say B. Hmm.\n"
