Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and he told her they need to leave by 3:45. She wasn't ready by 4:00, so he left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. He's stressed about being on time because he thinks it's rude to be late. So he's trying to make sure they get there on time. But Jill was still getting ready at 4:00, her clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice, then left her at home.\n\nHe says she's being defensive and he's right because she's in the wrong. But she's mad that he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry in time, and was mean. \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Did he have a right to leave? Well, he set a deadline, and she didn't meet it. But maybe he should have considered whether his timeline was realistic. He told her to start at 1:30 if she needed two hours. Did he account for possible delays, like the laundry not drying on time? Maybe he didn't plan for that. He might have assumed the laundry would dry, but if the machine took longer or there was a delay, that's on him. \n\nAlso, raising his voice in frustration is definitely a problem. Even if he's stressed, yelling isn't acceptable. That's disrespectful regardless of the situation. Then leaving her naked at home? That seems harsh. Even if she's responsible for being late, he could have handled it differently. For example, staying and getting her something else to wear, or calling someone to help. \n\nBut he does mention they have this conversation a lot, so maybe there's a pattern where she isn't managing time well. He might feel that he can't keep accommodating her last-minute delays. However, the way he handled it\u2014leaving her in that state\u2014is questionable. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) He yelled, which is inconsiderate. 2) He left her in an undressed state, which is potentially embarrassing and unsafe. 3) He didn't consider if his initial timeline was realistic, maybe not accounting for laundry or her needing more time. \n\nOn the other hand, she did know they needed to leave at 3:45 and didn't take that into account. But even so, his response was extreme. So maybe he's at fault for the yelling and leaving her. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
