Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to avoid being late to a wedding. The situation is that Jill, the fianc\u00e9e, isn't good with time management and they often end up late. The author gave a heads up about leaving at 3:45, but at 4:00, when she wasn't ready with slightly damp clothes, he left her. She's upset because he raised his voice, didn't make sure the laundry was dry, and called her a coward.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author was trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. He communicated the time they needed to leave, and when she wasn't ready, he left. But he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, which is definitely disrespectful. Also, he assumed the laundry would dry, which might have been an error if he didn't check. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have known her tendency to be late but didn't manage her time better. However, the author's response of leaving her without ensuring she could get there safely or with a ride might be problematic. Did he offer a ride? The story doesn't mention that. If he left her without a way to get to the wedding, that could be more of an issue. Also, yelling is never acceptable in a relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect, and consideration. The author tried to plan ahead but reacted in a way that was harsh. He should have perhaps given her a ride or waited a bit longer, even if she was late, to avoid her being stranded. Leaving her at home might have been a mistake, especially if she didn't have another way to reach the event. \n\nAlso, the author's frustration is understandable, but the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been an overreaction. The fianc\u00e9e's defensiveness could stem from feeling criticized, but she also might have contributed by not managing her time. However, the author's actions could have been more considerate. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author made a mistake by raising his voice and leaving without ensuring Jill could get to the wedding. Therefore, he's at least partially at fault. The answer is A (Yes).\n"
