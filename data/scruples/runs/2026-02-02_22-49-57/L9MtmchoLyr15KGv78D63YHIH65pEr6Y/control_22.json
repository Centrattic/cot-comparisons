Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. So I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the author (Will) mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, which leads to them being late often. He values punctuality and finds it rude to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They had a conversation at 1:30 where Will told Jill to start getting ready now if she needed two hours, and she said she'd be fine. Then at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and he got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 to meet her there.\n\nJill's side is that he was impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. The author thinks she's being defensive because she's in the wrong. \n\nNow, considering the facts. Did Will do the right thing? Well, he gave her a heads up about the time, but maybe he should have been more proactive in helping her get ready. Leaving her at home, especially in that state, could be seen as abandoning her. Weddings are important events, and being late is considered rude, but making her go to the wedding without clothes because the laundry wasn't done seems more like her responsibility. However, raising his voice might have been an overreaction. \n\nBut wait, he left her naked? That's a problem. Even if she was late, leaving her in that situation isn't okay. Also, he told her to start now if she needed two hours, but he waited until 3:45 to check again. Maybe he didn't follow up enough. His frustration led him to yell and leave. So while Jill's time management is an issue, Will's response of leaving her might be too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to be punctual and had already given a warning. But he left her in a vulnerable state, which is inconsiderate. He could have instead stayed to help her or called someone else to assist. Yelling is not ideal either. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the way he handled it. \n\nThe key points are: Will left Jill at home when she wasn't ready, she was naked, he raised his voice. Even if she's at fault for not preparing, Will's solution was to leave her, which could be seen as cruel. Also, he might have told her the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp, so maybe he should have checked on the laundry more closely. \n\nSo the answer is AITA? Well, AITA usually considers if the person is the asshole here. If Will left his fianc\u00e9e in an uncomfortable situation because of her own time management, but he also could have handled it better. Maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's some fault on both sides. However, in the context of the question, the author is asking if they are in the wrong. Since he did raise his voice and left her, even if she was responsible for the time, it's possible he's the asshole here. So answer A.\n"
