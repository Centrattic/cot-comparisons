Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The story is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, had a scheduled time to leave by 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. The author warned her to start getting ready at 1:30 PM so their clothes would be dry. She said she'd be fine. When 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and the author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her at 4:00 PM. She's upset because he yelled, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and left her.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author was concerned about being late, which he finds rude. He tried to give her a heads-up to start early. However, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, and left her alone. The fianc\u00e9e isn't great with time management, but the author's approach here might have been harsh.\n\nThe author's intention was to be on time, but leaving her alone might not have been the best solution. Yelling and then abandoning her could be seen as extreme. The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected, especially if she's stressed or not ready. Also, the author mentioned that he told her the clothes would be dry, but maybe he didn't account for possible delays. However, he did give her a timeframe and a reminder.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is responsible for her own readiness, but the author's response of yelling and leaving could be seen as overreacting. The key points here are communication and how he handled the situation. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, his method of handling it might be worse. He could have tried to problem-solve instead of leaving her alone. \n\nIn relationships, communication and respect are crucial. Yelling and leaving someone might be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The author might be in the wrong for not handling the stress better and for abandoning her. Alternatively, if he had a valid reason and she knew the risks, it's a gray area. But the act of leaving her alone, especially when she wasn't ready, could be seen as harsh. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction (defensiveness) might be because she feels attacked. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be that the author is partially at fault for his handling of the situation, even if the fianc\u00e9e's time management is an issue. The right approach might have been to stay and help her get ready or find another solution rather than leaving. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
