Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they were supposed to attend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. The author gave her a heads-up about leaving at 3:45 to make it on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but then her clothes weren't dry, and she was still getting ready when 3:45 came. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, telling Jill they'd meet there.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author set a clear deadline and reminded Jill. Jill, on the other hand, didn't take the timeline seriously and didn't prepare accordingly. The author's frustration led to raising their voice, which Jill takes as being mean. However, the author left to avoid being late, which was their intention from the start. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They followed through on their commitment to be on time, which shows responsibility. But they did raise their voice, which is a valid point in the argument. However, given that Jill's behavior was the root cause, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to repeated issues. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author tried to set expectations in advance. Jill's mismanagement of time is the main problem here. The author left to honor their commitment to the event and avoid being late, which is understandable. While the yelling was a mistake, the overall action of leaving might be justified given the circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not entirely in the wrong. They tried to plan and communicate, and their decision to leave was to uphold their end of the agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's repeated lateness is the core issue. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
