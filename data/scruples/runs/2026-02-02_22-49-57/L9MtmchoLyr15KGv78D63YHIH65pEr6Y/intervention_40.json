Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is described where the author is concerned about being late and has a history of Jill not being punctual. The key points here are their communication, the author's actions, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had a conversation earlier in the day about needing to leave by 3:45. He told Jill to start her laundry because they needed to leave on time. Jill said she'd be fine. Then, at 3:45, she was still not ready, clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated, yelled, and left. Now Jill is upset with him for being impatient, not ensuring her clothes were dry, and yelling.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? The user thinks he's not, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author tried to set a clear timeframe. He gave a heads-up about the 3:45 deadline. Jill, however, didn't take that into account and wasn't ready. The author's frustration is understandable because he's prioritizing punctuality and respect for others' schedules. However, raising his voice and leaving might be seen as harsh, even if he felt justified. \n\nIn a relationship, how one handles stress and conflict matters. Yelling could be seen as disrespectful, even if the other person is late. But Jill's pattern of lateness might contribute to the author's stress. The author made a choice to leave to be on time, which could be seen as taking responsibility for their own actions and respecting the event's schedule. However, leaving Jill alone in that state might be seen as abandonment or not being supportive.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill could be in the wrong for not managing her time and being prepared, leading to the situation. The author's actions were a response to a recurring issue. But the way he handled it (yelling and leaving) might not be the best approach, even if his goal was valid.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were to be on time and avoid being late, which is respectful. However, his method of handling the frustration by yelling and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate. Jill also has some responsibility to manage her time better. So, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on the outcome (author being on time) or the method (yelling and leaving).\n"
