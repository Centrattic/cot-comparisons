Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to get ready for a wedding they were supposed to attend on time.\n\nFirst, the context: They were going to a wedding starting at 4:30, 30 minutes away. The author gave a heads-up to leave by 3:45 to avoid being late. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, telling Jill they'd meet there.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't, but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are time management, communication, and the reaction. The author had warned Jill multiple times about the time, and she assured them she'd be ready. The author's frustration is understandable, as punctuality is important. However, leaving without their fianc\u00e9e might have been a harsh reaction. Raising one's voice is definitely an issue, but the main question is about leaving.\n\nJill's accountability is clear\u2014she wasn't ready when needed. The author's action of leaving might be seen as impatience or taking responsibility to be on time. But in a relationship, leaving a partner behind, even if they're unprepared, could be seen as abandonment. However, the author's reason was to avoid being late, which they consider respectful. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author took responsibility for their own actions and kept the commitment to be punctual. But others might argue that leaving without ensuring the partner's safety or offering help (like waiting a bit longer or calling someone else) could be problematic. However, the situation is a bit of a repeat, and the author has warned Jill before.\n\nThe author's frustration led to yelling, which is definitely a negative aspect. But the core issue is whether leaving was wrong. If the author left to avoid being late and had communicated the time clearly, they might be justified. But leaving a partner unprepared could be seen as abandoning them. However, given the recurring issue, maybe the author felt it was necessary.\n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up. The author might have a valid reason for prioritizing punctuality, but the method (leaving without ensuring Jill's readiness) is questionable. However, since Jill acknowledged the problem and the author tried to communicate, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
