Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding started at 4:30 and they live 30 minutes away, so they needed to leave by 3:45. The author told Jill to start getting ready by 1:30 because she tends to be late. At 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to go to the wedding, planning to meet her there later.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time and they often get into situations where they're late. The author believes that showing up late is rude, so they set a strict time. Jill, on the other hand, thought she could make it. The conflict arises when the author leaves Jill behind because she's not ready on time. The author feels justified because they don't want to be late, while Jill is upset about being called impatient, not being told the clothes might not dry in time, and the yelling.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The author left Jill to attend the wedding on time, prioritizing punctuality. However, they raised their voice, which is a form of yelling. Even if the author was frustrated, yelling can be seen as disrespectful. Also, the author might have not been clear about the laundry drying time, leading to confusion. Jill might have assumed the clothes would be dry, but the author said \"probably\" but left it up to her. So maybe the author didn't communicate clearly.\n\nLeaving a partner behind might be a last resort if they're not ready, but doing so without ensuring she's safe or comfortable could be problematic. The author's frustration led to an emotional reaction, which isn't ideal. However, the situation is a recurring issue with Jill's time management. The author tried to set a time and gave a heads-up, but Jill didn't take it seriously. So, some might see the author's actions as necessary to avoid being late, while others might think they handled it poorly.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The author could have handled the frustration better, but Jill's repeated issues with time management contributed. The key points are the yelling and the decision to leave. Yelling is a clear issue, but leaving might be a matter of prioritizing the event's timing versus supporting the partner. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding punctuality and conflict resolution. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the act of yelling and leaving might be seen as wrong, but the situation's context is complex. It's a tough call, but given the emotional reaction and the impact on the partner, the answer might lean towards the author being at least partially at fault.\n"
