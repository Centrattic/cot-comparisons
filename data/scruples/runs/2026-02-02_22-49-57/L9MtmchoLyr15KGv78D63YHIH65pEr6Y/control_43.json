Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they had agreed to leave by 3:45. The author had warned Jill earlier about timing, but she wasn't ready by 4:00. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They set a clear deadline (3:45) and reminded Jill earlier that they needed to leave on time. Jill, according to the author, has a history of poor time management and this conversation isn't the first time they've had issues. The author waited until 4:00 and then decided to leave. They mention leaving because they didn't want to arrive late, which they consider rude or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill is upset because the author raised their voice, didn't let her finish getting ready, and maybe even made a promise about the laundry drying. She might feel that the author was impatient and harsh. The author is framing the situation as Jill being at fault for not managing her time, while Jill is framing it as the author being mean and not considering her.\n\nI should think about whether the author overstepped. Yelling is generally not acceptable, even in stressful situations. However, the author's frustration might be understandable given past issues with being late. Leaving without someone, especially a partner, can be hurtful. But the author's intention was to respect the event's timing, which is a valid concern. However, leaving Jill at home might have been an extreme reaction. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss the problem calmly after the event rather than leaving in the middle of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author had warned Jill multiple times, so there's some responsibility on Jill's side for not preparing in time. But the author's decision to leave without her could be seen as abandoning their partner in a stressful moment. The key points here are communication, respect, and finding a balance between punctuality and empathy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be partially at fault for raising their voice and leaving, but Jill also shares responsibility for not being ready. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home, even if frustrated, could be seen as not supporting her and adding to her stress. Plus, the yelling is a negative action. On the other hand, if the author had tried to communicate better or given more time, maybe it would be different. But as it stands, the author's actions might be seen as harsh.\n"
