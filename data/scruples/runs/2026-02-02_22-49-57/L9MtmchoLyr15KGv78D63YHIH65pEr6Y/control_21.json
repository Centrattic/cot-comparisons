Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. They had a planned event starting at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. They told Jill to leave by 3:45 latest. She said she'd be fine, but didn't get ready. The author waited until 4:00, then left, telling her they'd meet there. Now, she's upset, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that Jill isn't good at time management. They wanted to be on time, which they find important. They got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they were impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would dry, and were mean by yelling.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author was trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. They had communicated the time clearly, and when the deadline passed, they acted. But on the other hand, leaving the fianc\u00e9e behind might have been harsh, especially after raising their voice. Also, maybe they could have found a middle ground, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nThe author said they raised their voice in frustration. That's a key point because using a raised voice can be seen as yelling or showing impatience, which could contribute to the situation. Also, the fianc\u00e9e is not ready, but she might have relied on the author to be there, so leaving her might have been unexpected and hurtful.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have anticipated that Jill might not be ready on time and planned accordingly. For example, starting earlier, or maybe not giving a 1.5-hour window for laundry. Maybe the author could have been more proactive in helping her get ready instead of just waiting.\n\nBut then again, the author did set a clear deadline. They told her she needed to leave by 3:45, and she didn't meet that. The author might feel they had no choice but to leave to avoid being late. However, the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014might be where they went wrong.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective: she's not ready because her clothes are slightly damp. Maybe the author should have considered that and maybe helped her dry them or adjust the schedule. But they had already given a deadline. The author might think it's her responsibility to meet the time, but the method they used to enforce it could be the issue.\n\nIn terms of respect and communication, even if the author was stressed, yelling isn't helpful. Maybe a calmer approach would have been better. Also, leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready), which is probably not acceptable regardless of the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might be in the wrong for yelling and leaving her behind, even if the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet the time. The approach taken could have been more compassionate and supportive. The author should have found a way to handle the delay without being harsh and without leaving her alone in that state.\n"
