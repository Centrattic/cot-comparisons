Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because she wasn't ready in time for a wedding. The story says that they had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM, but by that time, she was still not ready. The author raised his voice in frustration and left her at 4:00 PM, leading to her being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill often struggles with time management, which causes them to be late. He's concerned about being on time and finds lateness disrespectful. He gave her a heads-up about the time, and she assured him she'd be ready. But when she wasn't, he left. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't account for the laundry not drying on time, and left her. She might feel that he handled the situation poorly by raising his voice and leaving without her, even if she was at fault for not getting ready on time.\n\nNow, thinking about accountability. The author tried to communicate the necessary time frame ahead of time, which is reasonable. However, when he raised his voice, that's a problem. Yelling is a form of emotional harm and can be seen as disrespectful, even if he was frustrated. Leaving her not dressed and alone might also be an issue, especially in a relationship where support is important. \n\nBut then again, the author was trying to avoid being late to a wedding, which is a common concern. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been too harsh. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready or find a solution rather than leaving in frustration. \n\nIt's a mix of both. The author might not be entirely wrong because Jill did have the responsibility to be ready on time, but his reaction (yelling and leaving) was inappropriate. So, there's some fault on both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did raise his voice and left her, even if she was late, those actions contribute to him being in the wrong to some extent. But maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he had a valid reason to be on time. Hmm. Or maybe A because his actions were unkind despite the situation. \n\nI think the key points are: Did he handle the situation in a respectful way? Yelling is a no-go, and leaving her in that state is also unkind. So even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, his response was unhelpful and hurtful. Therefore, he shares some of the blame. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, some might say B because Jill was responsible for being ready. But the act of yelling and leaving is definitely a problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication and handling stress without being disrespectful is important. So even if the intention was good, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But others might argue he's not because Jill was the one who caused the issue. However, the way he reacted is more about how he handled it. So I think A is more appropriate here.\n"
