Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (let's call him Will) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to the wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes away. Will told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. They had this conversation at 1:30, where Will reminded her about the time and said if she needs two hours, she should start now. Jill said she'd be fine. But then at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are damp, and he got upset. He raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her. Now she's mad because he was impatient, said the clothes would be dry (maybe he implied that?), and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the main points here: Will set a clear deadline (3:45), Jill said she could make it, but didn't. He got frustrated and left. He raised his voice, which is a red flag. \n\nFrom Will's perspective, he's trying to be on time and respectful to others. He had communicated the time clearly multiple times. Jill didn't manage her time, leading to the situation. He left to not be late, which he considers important. But he did raise his voice, which is a problem. \n\nJill's side is that she's being defensive, but maybe she's frustrated too. She might feel that Will didn't support her when she was unprepared. Maybe she thought they could still make it together, but he didn't wait. Also, he said the clothes would be dry, which might have been a mistake if he wasn't sure. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Well, both might have some responsibility. Will raised his voice, which is unkind. But he did set a clear deadline, and Jill didn't meet it. However, leaving her alone in that situation after yelling might be harsh. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Will could have tried to problem-solve instead of leaving. Maybe he could have waited a little longer, or they could have left even if they were slightly late. Yelling adds to the tension. \n\nThe question is whether leaving her is the wrong. If Will left because he couldn't compromise on being late, but his reaction was harsh, then maybe he's in the wrong. Alternatively, if Jill's repeated time issues are a pattern, and he's justified in trying to avoid lateness, then maybe not. \n\nBut the key part is that he left her alone. Even if she was late, leaving her without support or trying to help might not be the best approach. Also, the raised voice indicates that his frustration might have led him to act impulsively. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation with yelling and left her, but there's some nuance. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving, and the options are A or B. Given that he left her after yelling, which is unkind, and his impatience, but also considering the context of her time management issues... Hmm. \n\nI think the key factors are the yelling and the decision to leave. Even if he was stressed, those actions are on him. So the answer might be A. But some might argue B because of her time management. But the question is about who is in the wrong. The author's actions (yelling and leaving) are the main issues here. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
