Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. The author says they told Jill they had to leave by 3:45 to be on time for the 4:30 wedding, but she wasn't ready by then, so he left her to get there on time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was concerned about being punctual, which is a valid social expectation. They probably wanted to respect the event's schedule and the hosts. But Jill wasn't ready, and the author got upset and raised their voice before leaving. The key points here are communication, expectations, and the action of leaving.\n\nThe author mentioned that this is a recurring issue where Jill struggles with time management. It's possible they've discussed it before, which adds context. However, raising your voice in frustration can come off as yelling, which might have made the situation worse. The author left Jill before she was ready, which could be seen as abandoning her. But they argue that they wanted to avoid being late, which they consider rude. \n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e's anger is directed at the author being impatient, lying about the clothes being dry, and being mean. The author might have made a mistake by not being patient and by yelling. However, the main action in question is leaving Jill before the event. The author had a valid reason (being on time), but the method might have been flawed. \n\nIs it fair to leave someone if they're not ready? If the author had to leave to meet a commitment, but if it's a shared event, maybe he should have stayed with Jill to help her get ready. But if the event was time-sensitive and they both couldn't be ready, the author's choice to go alone might be understandable. However, the act of leaving without her might be harsh, especially if she was relying on him to be there with her. \n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by assuming the clothes would be dry. They said \"probably but up to you,\" which Jill might have taken as a guarantee. So he could be partially at fault for not being clear. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to set a time, but Jill didn't meet it. The stress and yelling might not be helpful, but the decision to leave to be on time is a matter of priorities. Whether that's in the wrong depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. Some might say he should have been more patient, while others might support his choice to stick to the agreed time. \n\nBut leaving the fianc\u00e9e behind could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's to avoid being late. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to be punctual, but the way they handled it (yelling and leaving her alone) might be the issue. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action of leaving without her, especially when she's a fianc\u00e9e, is a bit harsh. However, if the event was very time-sensitive and they both knew the importance, maybe B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but the fianc\u00e9e's feelings are valid too. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key is the balance between respecting the event's timing and supporting the partner. The author's frustration and yelling also matter. So perhaps the author is partially at fault, but the main question is about leaving her. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often lean towards understanding if the person had to prioritize a commitment, but the manner in which they left and the yelling might tip the scales. So I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
