Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, let me understand the situation. The wedding starts at 4:30, and the author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes are still slightly damp, and she's not ready. The author gets frustrated, yells, and leaves her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no. The user already thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author planned to leave at 3:45, gave multiple warnings. Jill was aware of the time and still didn't prepare. The author was stressed about being late, which they find disrespectful. They raised their voice, which Jill is upset about. She's mad because he left her, and he thinks she's being defensive.\n\nNow, considering relationships and communication. Both partners have different approaches to time management. The author's frustration comes from repeated issues with being late. Jill might feel that the author is being too strict or impatient. The act of leaving her home alone could be seen as abandoning her, even if the intention was to be on time. Also, raising one's voice in frustration is a red flag in arguments.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's justification is that they were trying to respect the wedding schedule and had given multiple warnings. However, the decision to leave Jill might be seen as not supporting her, especially if she was in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes still damp), which could be unsafe or awkward. Leaving her behind could be a breach of trust, especially if they were supposed to go together.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that they couldn't compromise further on the timing. They had already set a deadline and waited beyond it. The frustration leading to yelling is a problem, but the core action of leaving could be seen as a choice to prioritize punctuality over supporting their partner.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by trying to help Jill get ready faster instead of just leaving. The yelling is also a negative aspect, as it's harmful in arguments.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for raising their voice and for leaving their partner, which could be seen as abandoning her in a difficult moment. Even if the intention was to be on time, the method was unkind and impractical. The author should have found a better way to manage the situation without causing emotional harm.\n"
