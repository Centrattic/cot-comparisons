Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that Jill has a history of poor time management, which often leads to them being late. They tried to set a clear deadline (3:45) to be on time for the 4:30 wedding. Jill assured them she could make it but wasn't ready by 3:45, so the author left without her.\n\nFrom the author's side, they wanted to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. They communicated the deadline, gave Jill a heads up, and even offered to do laundry earlier. When things didn't go as planned, they got frustrated and left. The author argues that Jill was in the wrong for not being ready and being defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that the author didn't give her enough time, considering the clothes were still damp. The author did say the clothes \"would probably be dry,\" but maybe that was an overestimation. Also, raising their voice could be seen as harsh, even if it was out of frustration. Leaving Jill alone might have been a harsh response, especially since they were going to a wedding, which is a significant event. Jill's reaction about being defensive suggests she felt criticized for her time management issues, which are part of the recurring problem.\n\nNow, considering the key points: communication, expectations, and actions. The author set a clear deadline and gave a heads up, which is good. However, when the deadline wasn't met, the response was to leave and meet there. Was that reasonable? If the author left because they didn't want to walk in during the aisle, maybe they should've waited a bit longer or communicated differently. Also, raising their voice could have made the situation more tense.\n\nThe author's main issue is that they left Jill alone, which might be seen as abandoning her, especially in a public event. However, Jill's chronic lateness could be a pattern that the author had reasonable expectations about. But maybe the author should have considered that the clothes being damp was an unforeseen issue, even if they were supposed to dry in time.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to work on communication. The author took action to meet the deadline but handled it in a way that caused conflict. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling that her time management isn't being accepted, even though she had a pattern. The author's frustration is understandable, but leaving alone might not have been the best approach. The yelling also adds to the issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on whether leaving was a reasonable response, considering the circumstances, it's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the author left without giving Jill a chance to explain or adjust, and considering the emotional impact (yelling and leaving), it's possible the author acted inconsiderately. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the way the situation was handled, even if the intention was to be on time. However, if the author's actions are seen as necessary to meet a commitment, then B (No) could be the case. But given the conflict caused, A might be more appropriate.\n"
