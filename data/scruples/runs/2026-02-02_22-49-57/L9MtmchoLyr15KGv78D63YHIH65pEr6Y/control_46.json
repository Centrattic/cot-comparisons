Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has a history of being late due to Jill's time management issues. The author, let's call him Alex, had warned Jill that they needed to leave by 3:45 to make it on time. Jill assured him she'd be ready, but by 3:45, her clothes were still damp, and she wasn't dressed. Alex got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, arriving at the wedding by 4:30. \n\nNow, considering the arguments. Jill is upset because Alex was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and raised his voice. Alex feels she's defensive because she knows she's in the wrong.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Communication and Warnings**: Alex gave multiple warnings about the time needed to get there on time. Jill was aware of the schedule but didn't manage her time accordingly. \n\n2. **Raising Voice**: Alex raised his voice in frustration. Even if justified by the situation, yelling can be seen as disrespectful, especially in a close relationship. \n\n3. **Leaving Without Her**: Alex left to avoid being late to the wedding, prioritizing punctuality over his partner's feelings. This could be seen as prioritizing an external commitment over their relationship, which might be hurtful. \n\n4. **Responsibility**: Jill is responsible for her time management, but Alex's reaction might have been too harsh. \n\nHowever, Alex's intention was to be on time, which is understandable. The wedding is a significant event where punctuality is expected. The conflict arises from Jill's repeated time issues, leading to stress for Alex. \n\nBut, the act of leaving her at home, even if she was unprepared, could be seen as abandoning her in a public setting (a wedding), which might be unkind. Also, raising his voice adds to the emotional harm. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both might share some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether his actions (leaving and yelling) were appropriate given the circumstances. While Jill's time management is a problem, the way Alex handled it could have been better. \n\nIn many similar situations, people often advise against raising your voice and instead suggest calmer communication. Also, leaving a partner at home might be seen as not supporting them, even if they're unprepared. So, while Jill is at fault for not managing time, Alex's reaction might be considered over the top and disrespectful. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction and decision to leave.\n"
