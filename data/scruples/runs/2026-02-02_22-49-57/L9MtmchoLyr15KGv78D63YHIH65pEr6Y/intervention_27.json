Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The scenario involves a recurring issue where the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management, leading to delays. The author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45) to leave by 4:00 for a 4:30 wedding. When she wasn't ready by 4:00, he left, which made her upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to avoid being late and being respectful to others. He gave a heads-up about the time, and Jill said she'd be okay. He even waited until 4:00. His frustration led to raising his voice, which is a point against him. On the other hand, Jill is accused of being defensive, but maybe she feels unsupported or unfairly criticized. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and the escalation of conflict. The author set a clear expectation, but his response was to yell and leave. While his intention was to be punctual, the method might have been harsh. However, given that this is a recurring issue, his reaction could be seen as a result of accumulated frustration rather than a single incident. \n\nIn relationships, how conflicts are handled matters. Yelling is generally not acceptable, but in this case, the context is that he was stressed about being late. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling criticized for her time management issues, which she might not have control over. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in raising his voice, which is a significant issue. However, the decision to leave might be more about his frustration with a pattern of behavior. But leaving someone at home when they're not ready could be seen as abandoning them in a stressful situation. \n\nOn balance, while the author's intention was good, his method of handling the situation (yelling, leaving without ensuring she could manage alone) might place some of the blame on him. However, the core issue is Jill's time management. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because of the recurring problem and the need to maintain punctuality. However, the yelling is a problem. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving her behind, which could be considered inconsiderate despite the circumstances.\n"
