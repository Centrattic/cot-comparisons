Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because they were going to be late to the wedding. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill to start getting ready by 1:30, giving her two hours. But by 3:45, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were slightly damp from the laundry, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to get to the wedding on time. Now, Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry taking longer, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nLet's break it down. The author had given a clear timeline, right? They mentioned at 1:30 that they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. That's a two-hour window for Jill to get ready, including laundry. If the laundry wasn't dry by 3:45, maybe they should have started earlier. But the author warned her to start early. Now, Jill didn't follow that advice, leading to the clothes being only slightly dry at 3:45. \n\nThe author got frustrated and left, which caused a conflict. But the author also admitted to raising their voice, which is negative. However, the main issue is whether leaving was justified. The author wanted to avoid being late to the wedding, which is a valid concern. However, leaving Jill alone while she's still getting ready might not be the best solution. \n\nOn one hand, the author made an effort to plan ahead, gave clear instructions, and tried to be punctual. On the other hand, raising their voice and leaving could be seen as a harsh response. But considering that the author had already warned about the time and Jill didn't manage it properly, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a middle ground. Could the author have waited a bit longer or helped Jill get ready instead of leaving? That might have been better. However, the author was under time pressure and stressed about being late. Their frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could have been handled more calmly. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as a result of stress and a desire to be punctual, which is valid, but their handling of the situation could have been more considerate. However, since Jill didn't meet the time constraints they had discussed, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they gave clear instructions and tried to adhere to the schedule, but their method of dealing with the situation could be improved. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and given the circumstances, the answer would be B.\n"
