Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were running late for a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, often has trouble with time management. They had already set a time to leave at 3:45 to make the 4:30 wedding on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, and then left.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they wanted to be punctual and respectful to the guests. They tried to give a heads-up and set a clear deadline. When that deadline passed, they took action to leave on time. The author feels that Jill is being defensive and knows she's at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that the author didn't support her enough. She trusted that the laundry would be dry by the time they left, but since it was only slightly dry, maybe she couldn't use the clothes. Also, the author raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling, making the situation more hostile. Leaving her behind might have caused her embarrassment or stress, especially since they were going to a wedding together. \n\nBut considering the context: the author had given multiple warnings, set a clear time, and when that time came, the fianc\u00e9e wasn't ready. The author's main goal was to avoid being late, which is understandable. However, raising their voice could have been unhelpful. Maybe the author could have handled the frustration differently, but the decision to leave might be seen as necessary to keep their own commitment. \n\nIs the author at fault? The key points are the prior warnings, the fianc\u00e9e's repeated time management issues, and the author's decision to leave when the deadline passed. While the yelling is a negative, the action of leaving might be justified if they had agreed on the importance of punctuality. However, leaving someone behind might cause them to face their own problems, which could be hurtful. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they followed through on their commitment and tried to manage the situation. But there's some nuance. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with some consideration for the yelling and the emotional impact. Still, based on the scenario, the author's actions were a result of Jill's repeated issues, so B might be the right choice.\n"
