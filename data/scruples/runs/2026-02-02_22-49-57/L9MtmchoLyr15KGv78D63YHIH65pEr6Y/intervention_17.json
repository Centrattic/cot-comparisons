Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author, let's call him Will, mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a conversation about leaving at 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. Will reminded her to start getting ready early because the laundry might take time. But when 3:45 hits, Jill is still not ready, and her clothes are only slightly dry. Will gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves her at home.\n\nJill is upset because Will was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry, and yelled at her. She thinks he's in the wrong. Will defends himself, saying she's being defensive and knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Will was trying to be punctual, which is a valid concern. They had discussed the timing beforehand, and Jill didn't meet the deadline. He might have felt that leaving was the only option to not be late. On the other hand, raising his voice and leaving her alone could be seen as harsh. Maybe there was a better way to handle the situation, like giving her a few more minutes or helping her get ready instead of just leaving. Also, Will's assurance that the clothes would be dry might have led to her not starting early enough, so there's some responsibility there too.\n\nBut let's think about the context. They're engaged, so their relationship is serious. Will's frustration is understandable, but choosing to leave her might have been a mistake. Maybe he should have communicated differently. However, Jill's consistent time management issues might have contributed to this. The key points are the prior conversation, Jill's history with this issue, and Will's reaction.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether Will's actions were proportionate. Yelling and leaving could be seen as overreacting, even if Jill was late. But given that they had this conversation multiple times and he gave her a clear deadline, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he handled it might be flawed. In relationships, communication is key. Maybe a compromise could have been found instead of just leaving. So perhaps the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he escalated the situation with yelling and left her alone, which could be hurtful. But others might say he's not in the wrong because he was trying to be punctual and gave her fair warning.\n"
