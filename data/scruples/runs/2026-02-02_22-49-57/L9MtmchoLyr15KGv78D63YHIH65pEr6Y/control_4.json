Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to attend a wedding on time. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away starting at 4:30. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. The author, let's call him Will, mentioned they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. At 1:30, Will offered to do laundry and checked if Jill needed anything. She said she'd handle her wedding clothes. He warned her about the time. Then, when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated, yelling before leaving her at 4:00.\n\nNow, the key points here. Will is concerned about being on time and considers lateness rude. He's tried to communicate the time constraints in advance. However, he raised his voice, which he admits was wrong. He left her at home, arriving at the event without her. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean. She might feel abandoned or that he didn't support her.\n\nIs Will in the wrong? Well, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, and that's unkind. Leaving her might have been a mistake because even if she was late, he could have waited a bit longer or helped her instead of leaving. However, his intention was to respect the event's timing and not be late. The problem is his method: yelling and leaving without trying to resolve the issue together. He could have been more patient and found another solution, like helping her get ready or adjusting their approach. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's chronic lateness is part of the issue. But in a relationship, partners should support each other. Leaving someone behind during an important event might not be the best solution. The author's actions show frustration but also a lack of problem-solving. He might not be entirely in the wrong because he had a valid concern about being on time, but his method of handling it was poor. \n\nSo, considering both sides: Will's frustration is understandable, but his actions (yelling and leaving) were harsh and could have been avoided. Jill's responsibility for time management is part of the problem, but Will's response escalated things. The answer might be that Will is partially in the wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not the degree. Since he admitted to yelling and left her, which could be seen as abandonment, maybe the answer leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong). Alternatively, if the focus is on his intention to be on time and the fact that Jill's lateness is a recurring issue, maybe not. But given the situation, leaving someone behind at home during an important event isn't ideal. So, probably A.\n"
