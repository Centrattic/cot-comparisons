Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they were supposed to attend. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45. The fianc\u00e9e's clothes were slightly damp from the dryer, and she wasn't ready by 4:00, so the author left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9e often struggles with time management, leading to them being late frequently. He's frustrated because he values punctuality and finds lateness rude. He warned her multiple times about the time, but she insisted she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he raised his voice and left. Now she's upset, saying he was impatient, made a promise about the clothes drying, and was mean by yelling.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected for being left alone, especially since the author raised his voice. Leaving someone in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry) could be seen as inconsiderate. The author did give a heads-up about the time, but maybe he should have handled the situation differently instead of leaving abruptly. \n\nHe did warn her about the time, so she had multiple chances to be ready. However, his response was to leave, which might be seen as abandoning her. Also, raising his voice adds to the tension. The fianc\u00e9e's time management issues are a recurring problem, but in this case, he made a choice that caused her to be left alone. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong. He had a valid frustration with her not being ready despite warnings, but leaving her in that state and yelling could be seen as harsh. However, the fianc\u00e9e also shares some responsibility for not managing her time better. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because he made a choice that was hurtful and left her in a difficult situation. However, some might argue he had a right to be frustrated. It's a bit of a toss-up, but in AITA scenarios, leaving someone behind like that is often seen as a mistake, even if the other person is at fault. So maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
