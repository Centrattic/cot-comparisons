Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is described where the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 to make it on time for the 4:30 wedding. The author gave a heads-up about the time, but Jill wasn't ready by 3:45. She was still getting ready, clothes were slightly damp, and the author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, saying they'd meet there.\n\nThe author thinks they're not in the wrong because Jill was in control of her time and they had discussed this before. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because of the yelling, not accounting for drying time, and being called impatient. The user, who is the author, is seeking validation and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, the author had set clear expectations about the time they needed to leave. Jill had been informed multiple times and even said she'd be fine. The author tried to be helpful by offering to do laundry, but Jill made her own choices. When the time came, she wasn't ready. The author's frustration led to raised voice, which is a problem. However, the author left to avoid being late, which they considered being respectful to the wedding attendees.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling is a form of raising one's voice in frustration, which can be hurtful. The author might have handled the situation better by trying to communicate more calmly instead of getting angry. However, given that they had discussed this before and Jill had control over her time, the author's decision to leave might be seen as taking responsibility for punctuality.\n\nBut the key points are: Did the author do something wrong by leaving? Or was it the fianc\u00e9e's responsibility to manage her time? Also, the yelling is a red flag. The author could be seen as not handling the situation calmly, but the main action (leaving) was to avoid being late, which is a matter of respect for others' time.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for leaving, as they had made their expectations clear and the fianc\u00e9e had control over her readiness. However, the yelling is a separate issue. But the question is specifically about being in the wrong for leaving. So the answer might be B (No), since the author tried to manage the time, gave warnings, and left to avoid being late, which is a reasonable action. The yelling is a flaw but doesn't necessarily make the leaving wrong.\n"
