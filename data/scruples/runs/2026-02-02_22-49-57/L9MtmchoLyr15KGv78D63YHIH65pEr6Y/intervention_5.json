Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues. So the author, let's call him Will, set a time to leave at 3:45 to get to the wedding on time. Jill, his fianc\u00e9e, said she'd be ready, but ended up not being ready by then. He waited until 4:00, got frustrated, yelled, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Will's perspective: he values punctuality and respects others' time. He's communicated the deadline multiple times, and Jill has shown a pattern of not managing time well. He might have felt that leaving was the only option to avoid being late to the wedding. He also mentions that Jill is defensive, thinking she's in the wrong.\n\nJill's side: she might feel that Will overreacted. She was doing laundry, which he said would probably be dry. Maybe she thought there was some flexibility. She could see his yelling as disrespectful, and his leaving as abandoning her, even if the event was the priority. She's upset about the impatience and maybe the broken promise about the clothes being dry.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. Will had a valid reason to be on time. He warned her beforehand. But he did raise his voice in frustration, which is a red flag. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Leaving her might have been a harsh reaction, but perhaps necessary to get to the event on time. However, maybe there was a middle ground, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nAlso, the fact that this conversation happens often suggests a recurring issue. Will might need to address the time management problem with Jill more constructively rather than reacting in frustration. But in this specific instance, he had a deadline. The key points are: did he have a right to leave, or was his reaction too harsh?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some. Jill should've managed her time better, and Will could've handled the stress without yelling. But the question is whether Will was in the wrong. Since he left her because he didn't want to be late, which is reasonable, but his yelling adds to the problem. However, the main issue is the lateness. The answer might be a mix, but in the AITA context, people often look for who is more in the wrong. If the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but others might say he should've handled it differently. The answer could be B (No), because while his reaction wasn't perfect, the main issue is Jill's time management. But some might argue that leaving was too harsh. Hmm.\n"
