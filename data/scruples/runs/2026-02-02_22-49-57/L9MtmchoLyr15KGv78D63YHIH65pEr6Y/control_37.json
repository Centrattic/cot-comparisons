Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves Jill not getting ready on time, and the author leaving her to meet at the event.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author set a time to leave at 3:45 to be on time. Jill wasn't ready by then, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her. He argues that Jill is being defensive because she's in the wrong. Jill is upset because he called her impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author had a valid reason to be on time, as being late is disrespectful. Jill had been warned to start earlier, which she didn't do. However, the author raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling. Then, he left her, which might be considered abandoning her in an embarrassing situation, especially since she wasn't dressed. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. While Jill's actions contributed to the situation, the author's response could have been handled better. Yelling and leaving her at home might be seen as harsh, even if he had good intentions. But he did try to communicate the time constraint, and she didn't follow through. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are important. The author's frustration is understandable, but leaving her in an undressed state could be seen as crossing a line. However, he was also trying to be respectful of the event's timing. \n\nI think the answer might be a bit nuanced. But since the question is binary (A or B), I need to decide. If the author's actions, while frustrated, were a reasonable response to her repeated time mismanagement, then maybe not in the wrong. But if his response was too harsh, then A. \n\nBut given that he left her without helping her get ready, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, yelling and leaving her in an undressed state might tip the balance. The key here is whether his actions were proportionate. Since he left her in a vulnerable state, that's probably where the issue lies. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
