Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The story is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are that the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, is not good at budgeting time. The couple had to leave by 3:45 to get to a wedding starting at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then. At 4:00, he left without her, raised his voice in frustration, and now she's upset, calling him impatient and mean. The author argues that she's being defensive and he's not in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to set a clear time and gave a heads-up. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. He was stressed about being late, which can be seen as impatience. On the other hand, Jill might have overestimated her ability to get ready on time, leading to the conflict. The author left to avoid being late, which could be justified if the event was important, but the yelling part is a problem. Raising one's voice in frustration is generally seen as disrespectful, even if the intention was to leave on time.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's common to look for a middle ground. The author made a mistake by yelling, which could have been handled more calmly. However, the decision to leave might be understandable if they didn't want to be late to a significant event. The key here is the yelling. Even if the author was stressed, yelling is a poor way to handle it. So, the author is partially at fault for the way the situation was handled, but maybe not entirely for leaving. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong for leaving. If the author left without causing harm (like a car accident) but in a stressful way, perhaps he's not entirely in the wrong. But some might argue that leaving a partner in such a situation is unkind, especially if she was already in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they had this conversation \"a lot,\" implying this isn't the first time. Maybe he should have addressed the time management issue more effectively before the event. However, in this specific instance, the main question is about the action of leaving and the yelling. The yelling is a definite issue. Leaving might be excusable if the event was a priority, but the combination of the two actions might tilt the blame towards the author. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the act of leaving is considered wrong. If the author left in a respectful manner, maybe not. But since he raised his voice and left, some might think he's in the wrong. But others might sympathize with not wanting to be late. The community's take often considers the intent and the actions. The yelling is a red flag, so the author is at least partially responsible. But is leaving the main issue? The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, so maybe the community might split, but the yelling is a significant factor. \n\nIn AITA, the \"A\" is for the person who did something questionable. The author's actions were leaving and yelling. Since they left in frustration and yelled, that's two points. But maybe the leaving is seen as a last resort. However, the fact that the fianc\u00e9e was left alone in an awkward situation might make the author the asshole. Alternatively, if she was responsible for her own time management, he's not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the note that he should have handled the situation more calmly. The main issue is the time management, and the author made a firm decision to leave rather than be late. The yelling is a mistake, but the act of leaving isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that he's at fault because he left her in a difficult spot. But given the context of prior conversations and the importance of punctuality, the author's perspective might be valid. So, I lean towards B.\n"
