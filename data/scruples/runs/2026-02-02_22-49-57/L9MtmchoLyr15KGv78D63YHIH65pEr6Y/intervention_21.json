Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues from Jill's side and the author's frustration leading to raising his voice and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author set a clear deadline (3:45) to leave, given the 30-minute travel time. Jill didn't meet that, so he left. He mentions they have this conversation often, indicating a recurring issue. The author's action was to leave to avoid being late, which he sees as disrespectful. On the other hand, Jill is upset because he raised his voice and left her, feeling he was impatient and not supportive.\n\nNow, analyzing who's in the wrong. The author did set a time and warned Jill, but she didn't manage her time. However, raising his voice is a problem. Yelling can be hurtful regardless of the situation. Leaving her might have been an attempt to take responsibility for their punctuality, but the method\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. The key points are communication style and responsibility. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the way he handled it (raising voice, leaving without her) might have been a mistake. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response could have been more constructive. Maybe he could have tried to calmly help her finish up or find a solution together instead of leaving. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners need to manage their responsibilities. While Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response in raising his voice and leaving could be seen as escalating the problem. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. Since he left to be punctual, which he values, but his method was confrontational, it's a mix of both sides. However, the question is about who is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the author left his fianc\u00e9e alone and upset, even if she was late, it might be seen as abandonment. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) format often looks at intentions and actions. The author's intention was to be on time, but the action of leaving her might have been unkind. The yelling adds to the problem. So, the author might share some fault here. However, Jill's consistent time issues also contribute. \n\nBut in the end, when someone is in a situation where they feel their partner isn't meeting expectations, the way they handle the conflict matters. The author's yelling and leaving could be seen as unkind and not supporting Jill, even if she was at fault. So, maybe the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are A or B, and the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, I need to decide based on the scenario. The author left to avoid being late, but the method was poor. So maybe the author is partially at fault, but the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, then B (No) because the main issue is Jill's time management, but the author's response could be better. But some might say A because of the yelling and leaving. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B (No) because the author acted to meet the commitment, but the method was flawed. However, in AITA scenarios, sometimes the person who is frustrated and takes action is seen as not the asshole if the other party is clearly at fault. But here, Jill's repeated issues are part of the problem. So, maybe the answer is B (No).\n"
