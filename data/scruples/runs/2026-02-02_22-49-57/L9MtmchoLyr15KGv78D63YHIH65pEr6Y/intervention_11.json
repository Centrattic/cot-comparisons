Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e (Jill) who isn't good with time management, and the author leaves her at home because they're about to be late for a wedding. The key points are the communication between them and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the author gave a clear warning at 1:30 PM that they need to leave by 3:45 PM. Jill said she'd be fine, but then wasn't ready by the time 3:45 hit. The author waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes past the deadline, and then left. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to plan ahead, set a time, and gave a heads-up. Jill didn't manage her time properly despite the warning. The author was stressed about being late, which they consider rude. On the other hand, the author raised their voice in frustration, which could be seen as yelling. Then they left Jill alone, which might be considered abandoning her, even if she was at fault for not being ready.\n\nJill is upset that the author didn't let her clothes dry, but the author said they were unsure if they'd dry in time. So maybe the author isn't entirely to blame there. However, the author did raise their voice, which is a negative action regardless of the situation. Leaving someone, even if they're at fault, might be seen as harsh. But the author's intention was to arrive on time for the wedding, which is understandable.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. The author waited until 4:00 and then left, which shows some patience, but the yelling adds to the problem. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like waiting a bit longer or helping Jill get ready instead of leaving. However, Jill's repeated issues with time management suggest it's a recurring problem, and the author might have felt it was the only way to avoid being late again.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a mix. The author isn't entirely wrong because they set clear expectations, but their reaction (yelling and leaving) might have been too harsh. Jill is also at fault for not managing her time. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being a shared responsibility, but the question is specifically about the author's fault. If the community thinks the author went too far despite Jill's mistake, then the answer would be A. If they think the author had a valid reason and Jill is being defensive, then B. Given that the author did leave Jill alone, which could be seen as a serious action, maybe A. But considering the context of repeated issues, maybe B. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because leaving someone behind, even if they're late, is a harsh response and the yelling contributes to the problem. However, some might argue B because the author had valid reasons. But in a relationship, communication and support are key, so leaving might not be the best approach. So, probably A.\n"
