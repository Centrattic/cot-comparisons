Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves a recurring issue with time management.\n\nFirst, the author and Jill have a history of being late. The author is concerned about punctuality, which they see as respectful, while Jill isn't good at budgeting time. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. However, Jill wasn't ready until 4:00, with clothes only slightly dry, and the author left her at home.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author isn't, but wants others' opinions.\n\nKey points to consider: The author gave a clear time to leave, Jill didn't prepare on time. The author raised their voice but left before the event started. The main conflict is between punctuality and Jill's time management. The author's action was to leave, not to abandon, and they were trying to be on time. However, leaving the fianc\u00e9e behind might be seen as harsh, even if justified by the author's perspective. There's a pattern here, so the author might be reacting to repeated issues.\n\nPossible arguments for A (author in the wrong): Leaving someone behind could be considered inconsiderate. Even if Jill was at fault, the author could have waited a bit longer or made a different arrangement. The yelling is another point against the author.\n\nPossible arguments for B (author not in the wrong): The author communicated the deadline, Jill was aware. The author's frustration is understandable given the recurring problem. The action was to avoid being late, which the author values as respectful.\n\nI think it's a bit of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author took action to ensure punctuality and has a history with this issue, maybe B is the answer. But the yelling and leaving could be seen as harsh. However, the user's own opinion is B, so I need to decide based on the details. The author did follow through on their word to leave at 3:45 when Jill wasn't ready. The main issue is Jill's time management, so the author isn't entirely at fault. Answer B.\n"
