Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The situation is a wedding starting at 4:30, and the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready by 3:45 when they needed to leave. The author waited until 4:00 and then left her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had warned Jill that they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels the author was impolite, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and yelled.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: They emphasized punctuality as a matter of respect, had given prior warnings, and tried to manage the time. They left because they didn't want to be late to the wedding, which is a significant event. Their frustration led to yelling, which is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have overestimated her time and preparation. She agreed to the 3:45 deadline but didn't meet it. The fact that her clothes were slightly damp suggests the laundry might not have dried, which the author had mentioned could happen. However, the author had told her to start the laundry earlier if needed. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's reaction. While being late is disrespectful, the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. Leaving a partner alone at home, especially on a significant day like a wedding, might cause emotional distress. The author's impatience and loss of temper could make them seem dismissive of Jill's efforts, even if she was at fault for not being ready.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's anger is partly justified because being yelled at is never acceptable. The author should have found a better way to handle the frustration without raising their voice. Also, leaving Jill alone might have been a poor decision, as it could be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to maintain punctuality, which is a common social expectation. The problem is the method used to achieve that. The author is partly right in wanting to be on time, but their approach was flawed. The fianc\u00e9e's defensiveness might stem from feeling attacked, which is valid when someone raises their voice in frustration. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have communicated the urgency better without becoming hostile. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe giving a few more minutes and checking in again. The fact that this is a repeated issue (they have this conversation often) suggests that maybe they need to find a solution together, like adjusting the time buffer or Jill improving her time management. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author is in the wrong for raising their voice and leaving, but the fianc\u00e9e also has responsibility in not meeting the deadline. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author's actions caused emotional harm and could have been handled more kindly, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
