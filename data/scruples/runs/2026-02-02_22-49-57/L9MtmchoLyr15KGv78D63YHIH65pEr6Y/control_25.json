Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left their fianc\u00e9e at home is in the wrong. The situation is about being late to a wedding due to time management issues.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, has a history of not budgeting time well, which causes delays. The author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) for leaving, but Jill wasn't ready by then. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her at home to meet there.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's frustration is understandable because they value punctuality and don't want to be late, especially for a wedding. However, leaving Jill at home when she was still getting ready seems harsh. Even if she was late, the author had the option to wait a bit longer or handle the situation differently without abandoning her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author tried to set a time, but maybe didn't check in with Jill again after 3:45. Raising their voice was a mistake, showing a lack of patience. However, Jill's repeated time management issues might have contributed to the problem. \n\nBut leaving her alone when she was still getting ready could be seen as inconsiderate. The author could have waited a little longer or offered help. The fact that Jill was upset because she felt the author was impatient and mean suggests that the approach was too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be on time, which is respectful to the wedding guests. However, the method of leaving Jill behind, especially when she was still in the process, might be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made a mistake by yelling and leaving Jill, even if Jill's behavior contributed to the situation. The author should have found a more compassionate way to handle the delay, perhaps by waiting a bit more or working together to get ready. Therefore, the author is partially at fault.\n"
