Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready for a wedding they were supposed to attend. The key points are the fianc\u00e9e's repeated issues with time management and the author's frustration leading to raising their voice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They gave a heads-up about the departure time, which the fianc\u00e9e dismissed. Then, when the time came, she wasn't ready, and the author left. The author admits to raising their voice in frustration, which might be a point against them. However, the main issue is about being late to an event they were both supposed to attend together.\n\nOn the fianc\u00e9e's side, she's not budgeting her time well, leading to recurring problems. The author has tried to communicate this before, but she's confident she can manage. The author leaves as a last resort to not be late, which might be seen as a necessary action given their values about punctuality.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, physically leaving might be a consequence of her not being ready, but the raised voice could be seen as harsh. However, the author's intention was to respect the event's timing. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about being left and the yelling. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe both have some responsibility. The author tried to set a time, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't prepare on time. However, the author's solution was to leave alone, which might not be ideal. But considering the context of recurring issues, the author might feel that this was a necessary decision to avoid being late. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a better angle. Maybe the author should have waited a bit longer or communicated differently. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since leaving was a result of the fianc\u00e9e's repeated time management issues, it's more on her. So I think the answer is B.\n"
