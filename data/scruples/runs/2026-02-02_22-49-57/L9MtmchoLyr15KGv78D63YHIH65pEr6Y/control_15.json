Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a prior conversation about leaving by 3:45 PM. The author gave a heads-up and warned her to start early. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came around, she wasn't ready. The author waited until 4:00 and then left, leading to some frustration and raised voices.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author tried to communicate the time constraints in advance. They gave a specific deadline and reminded her. Jill didn't adhere to that timeline. The author felt it was important to be punctual and not miss the ceremony, so they left to make it on time. However, they did raise their voice, which Jill found mean. \n\nNow, considering the situation from both sides. The author's intention was to be respectful to the event by not being late, which is understandable. But leaving Jill behind could be seen as abandoning her, and the raised voice might have been unkind. On the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time as agreed and might be responsible for the delay. However, the author's actions led to conflict, which could affect their relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to set clear expectations. But leaving without ensuring Jill could get there or offering another solution could be seen as a mistake. Also, raising their voice was a lapse in handling the situation calmly. However, Jill's behavior (not ready on time) might be the root cause. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be entirely at fault because they communicated the time, but their reaction could have been better. But since they left Jill behind, maybe they should have considered alternatives. The answer might be a mix, but the question is binary. Given that, the author's actions were a response to Jill's time management issues, but their method could have been more considerate. However, the main issue was Jill not being ready. The author might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. So, maybe answer B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
