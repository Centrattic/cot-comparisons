Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. The key points are that Jill isn't good with time management, and they had a prior conversation about needing to leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were still damp and she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to meet there, causing Jill to be angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning: they wanted to be on time, have had this issue before, and felt frustrated. Leaving to avoid being late for the wedding, which is a significant event, might make sense to them. But raising their voice and leaving Jill alone could be seen as harsh.\n\nJill's perspective: She might feel betrayed or hurt that her fianc\u00e9e left her, especially if she was trying but maybe didn't plan correctly. She could see the author's actions as impatience and a lack of support. Also, the author promised the clothes would be dry, but maybe that wasn't the case, leading to her being unprepared.\n\nNow, looking at the author's actions. They did warn her ahead of time, gave a strict deadline, and when the deadline passed, they made a decision. However, yelling is definitely a negative point. Leaving someone alone when they're not ready might be seen as abandoning them, even if it's to meet a time constraint. But the author's intention was to not be late, which is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they acted out of frustration and a desire to be punctual, which is a valid concern. On the other, yelling and leaving could have been handled more compassionately. Maybe they could have tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving. However, the situation might have escalated quickly, and the author was stressed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, Jill might be at fault for not managing her time as agreed, but the author's response (yelling and leaving) could also be seen as overreacting. The author's solution of leaving left Jill in an awkward position, possibly making her feel unsupported. However, it's also possible that the author felt they had no other choice to avoid being late. \n\nConsidering the overall context, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is understandable, but their method of handling it could be questioned. The key factors are the prior conversations about time management, the specific deadline, and the emotional response. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they tried to plan ahead, but their reaction (especially the yelling) and the decision to leave without ensuring Jill's safety or comfort could tip the balance. Alternatively, if they prioritized the event over their partner's feelings, that's a problem. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for the yelling and the abrupt leave, but also Jill is responsible for not managing her time. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since they left Jill to go to the event alone, maybe that's inconsiderate, but they had a valid reason. It's hard to say. Maybe the answer is that the author is somewhat in the wrong for the way they handled it, but not entirely. However, the user's original thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation, maybe the answer is A (yes) because of the yelling and leaving, but the user thinks it's B. Hmm. I need to decide based on the information. The author's main mistake was yelling and leaving, which could be seen as impatience and unkindness, but the context of prior issues and the event's importance complicates it. I think the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since both parties have some responsibility, maybe it's a shared fault. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If the author left Jill alone, that's a problem. So, perhaps the answer is A.\n"
