Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. But when 3:45 came, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were still slightly damp from the dryer, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, and then left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be late and think it's disrespectful to others to arrive late. They've had this issue before with Jill's time management. On the other hand, Jill is upset because the author yelled, made a promise about the clothes drying, and left her in an awkward situation.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author had warned Jill earlier that they needed to leave by 3:45 and suggested starting the laundry. Jill said she'd be fine, but that didn't happen. However, when the author got frustrated and raised their voice, that's a problem. Yelling is unkind and can escalate tensions, even if the person feels wronged. Then, leaving Jill behind might have been done to prioritize punctuality, but it's also leaving a partner in a vulnerable state (naked with damp clothes) which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author might argue that they were trying to respect the event's schedule, but the method of doing so\u2014raising their voice and abandoning their fianc\u00e9e\u2014could be seen as harsh. Jill's time management issues are valid, but the author's response might have been more about their own frustration than a fair solution. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe instead of yelling and leaving, the author could have discussed alternatives, like calling the hosts to explain the delay or offering to help Jill get ready faster. Leaving her alone in that state might have been the wrong action, even if the intention was to be on time. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author did act in a way that could be seen as disrespectful\u2014yelling and abandoning their partner. While Jill is at fault for not managing her time, the author's response is also problematic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole), meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
