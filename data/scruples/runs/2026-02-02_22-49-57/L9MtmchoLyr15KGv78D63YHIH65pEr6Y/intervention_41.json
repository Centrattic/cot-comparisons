Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home when they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They've had this issue before. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author gave a clear deadline of 3:45 PM to leave. Jill didn't meet that, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still in the house. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized for being impatient, not ensuring the clothes would dry, and yelling. But the user thinks the author is not in the wrong because Jill didn't meet the agreed time. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author tried to set a clear expectation and gave a heads-up. Jill didn't adhere to that, leading to the delay. The author's frustration is understandable, especially regarding punctuality for a social event. However, raising their voice and leaving might have been an overreaction. \n\nBut the key point is the author's intent: they wanted to be on time and couldn't wait anymore. The decision to leave was to respect the wedding schedule, not to abandon Jill. The author might be in the right for prioritizing punctuality, but the method of handling it (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. However, given the context of repeated issues, the author's actions might be justified as a last resort. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation. The main issue is the recurring problem with time management, and the author acted to prevent being late again.\n"
