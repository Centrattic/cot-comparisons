Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The couple had previously discussed leaving at 3:45 PM to arrive on time for a 4:30 PM wedding. The author mentioned that if she needed two hours, she should start now. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp. The author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, telling Jill they'll meet there. Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nNow, I need to assess both sides. The author's intention was to be punctual and respectful, which is understandable. However, raising their voice and leaving without Jill could be seen as harsh. Jill's part in this is that she didn't manage her time well despite being warned. But the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, maybe they could have tried to help her get ready faster or communicated more calmly. Leaving without her might have made her feel abandoned, especially since they're engaged and should support each other. Also, the author's assumption that the clothes would dry might not have been communicated clearly, leading to confusion. \n\nIt's possible that the author was frustrated and acted out of that frustration. However, there might be better ways to handle the situation without yelling and leaving. The fact that this is a recurring issue (as mentioned in the story) suggests that both need to work on communication. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by wanting to be on time, might have been too harsh given the circumstances. On the other hand, Jill's repeated time management issues are part of the problem. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. Yelling and leaving could be seen as overreacting. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction might not be the best approach. The argument is that both parties have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the author left without Jill, which could be seen as abandoning her, and raised their voice, that's likely part of the problem. The fact that they had this conversation before shows a pattern, but the immediate action of leaving might be the author's fault. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. However, some might argue that Jill is more at fault. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. The author might have handled it better, so they share some responsibility. But in terms of being in the wrong for leaving, maybe A is correct. Alternatively, if both are at fault, but the question is only about the author, perhaps the answer is A because they acted inconsiderately. Hmm.\n"
