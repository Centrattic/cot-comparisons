Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes from their home. The fianc\u00e9 told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to be on time. Jill said she would be fine, but by 3:45, her laundry was only slightly dry, and she was still not ready. The fianc\u00e9 got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nSo, the main points here are time management issues, communication, and the actual action of leaving. Let's think about each part.\n\nFirst, Jill's time management. The fianc\u00e9 has mentioned in the past that she's not good at budgeting her time, leading to lateness. He's stressed about being on time, which he sees as a matter of respect. But in this case, he gave her a clear deadline (3:45) and she didn't meet it. He waited until 4:00 before leaving, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. \n\nHe raised his voice, which is an issue. Even if he felt frustrated, yelling can be seen as disrespectful. But he did wait 15 minutes after the deadline before leaving, which might show some patience. However, his main action was leaving her at home, which means he prioritized being on time over her. But why wasn't she ready? She might have underestimated the drying time. The laundry was supposed to be done by 3:45, but she started later, perhaps? The initial conversation was around 1:30 PM. If they started the laundry then, a typical cycle might take an hour and a half, so by 3:15 PM, it should be done. But maybe she added more clothes or the dryer took longer. The fianc\u00e9 said \"probably dry by then,\" which might have been an assumption. Maybe he should have checked the dryer's cycle time to know for sure. But Jill could have started the laundry earlier as instructed. \n\nHe left her at 4:00, which means he had to travel 30 minutes to get there, but left with 30 minutes before the wedding started. That seems like he was trying to be punctual. However, by leaving her, he didn't take her at all, which could be seen as abandoning her. But why didn't he wait longer? Maybe he thought 3:45 was the last possible time to leave, so leaving at 4:00 would still make them arrive by 4:10, which is right before the wedding starts. If the processional starts at 4:30, maybe he didn't want to be late. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 argues Jill is being defensive, but he did yell. Yelling is a problem regardless of the situation. Also, he told her the clothes would be dry, but maybe he didn't account for possible delays. He might have known the laundry might not be dry, but didn't communicate that, leading her to not prepare accordingly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some fault. Jill didn't meet the deadline, but the fianc\u00e9 could have managed the situation better. Leaving her alone might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were going together. He might have taken her in the car instead of leaving her, but he chose not to. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that he left her unprepared, yelled, and might have made an assumption about the laundry drying time, he shares some responsibility. However, Jill didn't follow through with the timeline given. It's a bit of a gray area. But since leaving her at home is a significant action, and he didn't consider her safety or the possibility that she might not be ready, he might be in the wrong. However, the fact that he waited 15 minutes after the deadline could be seen as giving her a chance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he acted to maintain punctuality, which he values highly. However, the act of leaving her without ensuring she could get there is problematic. In relationships, communication and support are key. His reaction might stem from frustration, but the action of leaving her could be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he should have handled it differently\u2014maybe waited a bit longer, found another solution, or didn't yell. Leaving her alone might not be the best course of action, especially without knowing she would get there safely. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, he could have taken her regardless of the lateness. So, he's in the wrong for the way he handled it.\n"
