Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend, which started at 4:30 PM. The fianc\u00e9 told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to be on time. Jill didn't start her laundry in time, so when the time came, her clothes were still damp, and she wasn't ready. The fianc\u00e9 got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home, saying he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that Jill's poor time management causes them to be late often. He values punctuality and finds lateness disrespectful. He warns her about the time, but she doesn't follow through. When she's not ready, he leaves to avoid being late to the wedding. He thinks she's being defensive and in denial about her mistake.\n\nJill's side, as presented, is that she's mad because he was impatient, lied about the clothes drying, and was mean by yelling. She's defensive, possibly because she feels she's at fault but doesn't want to admit it.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. **Communication and Planning**: The fianc\u00e9 gave a clear deadline and warned Jill about the time. He also offered to help by asking if she needed her clothes in. Jill, on the other hand, didn't start the laundry in time, leading to the problem. This suggests that she might have misjudged the time required.\n\n2. **Reaction to the Situation**: The fianc\u00e9 got upset, raised his voice, and left. His reaction is a response to Jill's repeated issues with time management. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction, even if he's frustrated.\n\n3. **Consequences of Leaving**: By leaving Jill alone, he prioritized his own timeline and punctuality over addressing the problem together. This might be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation, especially since she wasn't fully dressed. It could cause her embarrassment and distress.\n\n4. **Responsibility Sharing**: While Jill's time management is a recurring issue, the fianc\u00e9 could have handled the situation differently. Instead of leaving abruptly, he could have tried to find a solution together, like calling to check if she could be ready faster or offering to wait a bit longer while she finishes, even if it means arriving late.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: Yelling and leaving might have caused emotional harm, even if the intention was to be on time. Relationships require empathy and support, so reacting with frustration without considering the emotional toll might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\n6. **Alternative Solutions**: The fianc\u00e9 could have considered other options, such as driving separately if he wanted to be on time, or using the time she was getting ready to prepare something else. However, he chose to leave, which might not be the most constructive approach.\n\nIn terms of fault, Jill's poor time management is a contributing factor, but the fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as the immediate wrong. While he had a reason to be frustrated, his method of handling it may have been inconsiderate. The key here is whether his reaction was proportionate and respectful. Yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill was okay might be the issue, even if she was at fault for not managing her time.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he chose a harsh reaction (yelling and leaving) that could be seen as abandonment, even though Jill's time management was problematic. The right approach would be to address the issue without such a stressful reaction, perhaps finding a middle ground that respects both punctuality and mutual support.\n"
