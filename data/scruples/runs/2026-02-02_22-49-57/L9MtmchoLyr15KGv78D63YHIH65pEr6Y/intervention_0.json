Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they usually end up late or stressed. This time, they told Jill to start her laundry early because they had to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, clothes were only slightly dry, and she was naked. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to avoid being late for the wedding.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry getting dry, and yelled. The author thinks Jill is defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nNow, the key points. The author tried to plan ahead, gave a clear deadline, and left a heads-up. Jill didn't follow through, leading to the problem. The author's frustration is understandable, but raising their voice and leaving might be seen as harsh. However, given Jill's history, maybe the author felt it was necessary to leave on time to respect the event's schedule.\n\nBut relationships often require compromise and communication. Did the author consider that maybe Jill needed more time, even if she said she'd be ready? Raising voice adds to the conflict. Maybe the author could have waited a bit longer or communicated differently. However, the author did wait until 4:00 before leaving, which was 15 minutes after the deadline. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, Jill didn't meet the deadline, but the author's reaction might have been too abrupt. However, the author's intention was to be punctual, which is a valid concern. The question is whether leaving was the right move. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't entirely wrong since they tried to plan and left a clear message. But the yelling and leaving could have been handled better. However, since they had a history of this issue, maybe the author felt justified. The answer hinges on whether being punctual justifies the actions taken, and if the author made reasonable efforts to communicate the importance of time without being harsh.\n"
