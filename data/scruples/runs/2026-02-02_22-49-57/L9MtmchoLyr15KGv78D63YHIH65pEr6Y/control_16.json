Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, looking at the timeline: The wedding starts at 4:30, and they need to leave by 3:45. At 1:30, the author mentions doing laundry and gives a heads-up about the time they need to leave. Jill says she'll be fine. By 3:45, she's still not ready. The author gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves after waiting until 4:00.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author had warned Jill multiple times about the time constraints. She assured him she'd be ready, but clearly wasn't. The author then leaves, which Jill sees as impatience and meanness.\n\nNow, the author argues that he's not in the wrong because Jill was responsible for her time management. He tried to set expectations early. On the other hand, Jill feels disrespected because he didn't accommodate her needs, even if she made a mistake.\n\nIs raising his voice part of the issue? Yes, yelling can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the situation. Leaving without her might be a problem because it's a wedding, and both were supposed to attend together. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the history of similar issues.\n\nBut, in a relationship, communication and support are key. Even if Jill is at fault for not managing her time, the author's reaction (raising his voice and leaving) might be seen as harsh. He didn't account for her stress or try to help her get ready. Instead, he took a confrontational approach.\n\nSo, while Jill is responsible for her part, the author could have handled the situation better. Maybe waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of leaving. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Depending on cultural norms, some might say he's in the right to prioritize punctuality. Others might say his reaction was too harsh.\n\nBut in terms of accountability, since he raised his voice and left her, that's a point against him. He didn't consider her feelings or the fact that the clothes were still damp. He also didn't check if there was another solution, like taking the slightly damp clothes or helping her dry them.\n\nTherefore, the author is partially at fault for his reaction and leaving. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
