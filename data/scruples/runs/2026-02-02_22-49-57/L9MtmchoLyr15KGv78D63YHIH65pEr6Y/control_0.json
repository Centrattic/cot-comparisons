Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves a recurring issue where the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, often mismanages her time, leading to delays. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The wedding starts at 4:30 PM, and they have to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to arrive on time. The author (Will) told Jill at 1:30 PM that they should leave by 3:45, and she said she'd be fine. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still in the house. Will got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, promising to meet her there.\n\nThe main points of contention here are: 1) Will raised his voice in frustration, which Jill interprets as being mean. 2) Will left her at home, not wanting to arrive late to the wedding. 3) The recurring issue of time management from Jill's side.\n\nNow, considering the expectations of punctuality. Will values being on time and considers lateness disrespectful. Jill, on the other hand, seems to have a history of poor time management. Will gave her a clear deadline and a heads-up earlier in the day. But Jill didn't meet that deadline, leading to his frustration.\n\nThe key question is whether leaving her at home was justified. Will's intention was to arrive on time, which is understandable. However, the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving her alone\u2014might be problematic. Even though he had a valid reason to be upset, raising his voice could be seen as yelling, which is hurtful. Also, leaving her at home might have been an overreaction, especially if she was still in the process of getting ready and the clothes were only slightly damp, not completely wet. Maybe he could have waited a few more minutes or communicated differently. \n\nBut on the other hand, Jill did agree to the 3:45 PM deadline and failed to meet it, knowing the consequences. The author might feel that her lack of preparedness forced his hand. However, in a relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9e, the approach to conflict matters. Yelling and abruptly leaving could be seen as harsh, even if the underlying issue is her time management. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: Will had a valid concern about punctuality and gave clear instructions. Jill didn't meet her end of the bargain. But Will's response (yelling and leaving) might be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether his actions were justified given the recurring problem. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at both intentions and the impact. Will's intention was to be on time, but his method of handling the situation could be perceived as harsh. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling criticized, which she might perceive as unfair if she's aware of her tendency to be late. However, she also had a chance to prepare and didn't. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether leaving her was a reasonable response. If there was no alternative, like waiting a bit longer or calling someone else to pick her up, then leaving her alone might be seen as inconsiderate. However, given that they were going to be late and he didn't want to walk in late, his actions might be seen as his way of maintaining respect for the event's timing. But the yelling complicates things. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author (Will) might be partially at fault for how he handled the situation, especially the yelling and abrupt departure. But Jill also shares responsibility for not managing her time properly. However, in the context of AITA, the community might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the way he reacted, even if the underlying issue was Jill's fault. So, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) might be appropriate here.\n"
