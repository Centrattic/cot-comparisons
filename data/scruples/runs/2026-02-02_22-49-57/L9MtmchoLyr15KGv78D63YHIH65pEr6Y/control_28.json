Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is described in the AITA post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (let's call him Will here) mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late often. This time, they had a wedding starting at 4:30, and Will told her they needed to leave by 3:45. He warned her at 1:30 about the time, but she didn't start preparing in time. At 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 to make it on time. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would be dry (even though he said \"probably up to you\"), and yelled.\n\nNow, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, communication. Will warned Jill multiple times about the deadline. He told her at 1:30 that they need to leave by 3:45. He reminded her about the laundry and that the clothes would probably be dry if she started then. She said she'd be fine, but didn't start in time. So, he did his part in communicating the time constraints. \n\nHowever, when she didn't meet the deadline, he raised his voice. That's a problem because yelling can be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Then, he left her at home. The reason given is to avoid being late. But leaving her behind might have been a harsh reaction, even if the time issue is her fault. \n\nNow, Jill's response is that Will is impatient and didn't tell her the clothes would dry. Wait, the user says he told her \"probably\" it would be dry, but she asked \"Will they be dry by then?\" and he said \"Probably but up to you.\" So he didn't guarantee it. That part might be a point in his favor. However, he did raise his voice, which is a negative point. \n\nLeaving her at home\u2014was that necessary? Well, the wedding started at 4:30. If they left at 3:45, they had 30 minutes to get there. If he left at 4:00, he had 25 minutes. That's still enough time, assuming traffic wasn't an issue. But the problem is that he left her behind. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, leaving her at home could be seen as abandoning her, which is inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, he wanted to be on time and not walk in during the ceremony. That's a valid concern. However, the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be the issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say he took responsibility for punctuality but handled it poorly. Others might say that he should have waited longer or communicated better. Since he did raise his voice, that's a clear mistake. Also, leaving her behind without ensuring she could get to the event herself might be another issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who acted inconsiderately. Will's actions, while possibly justified in wanting to be on time, involved yelling and leaving her. Jill's inconsiderate for not being ready, but he escalated the situation. \n\nI think the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving her behind, even if the time issue was her fault. The way he handled the situation was disrespectful, and there might have been a better way to handle it without abandoning her. The community usually sides against the person who used harsh words or actions, even if the other party was at fault.\n"
