Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding. The situation revolves around time management and conflict.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call him Will for clarity) mentions that Jill often has trouble budgeting her time, leading to them being late. He values punctuality and finds lateness rude. For the wedding, he set a clear deadline of 3:45 PM to leave by 4:00 PM, but Jill wasn't ready when that time came. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, made promises about the laundry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the main points here are: communication, expectations, and the action of leaving. Will gave a clear deadline. Jill said she'd be fine but wasn't ready. He waited until 4:00 and left. But he also yelled, which is a key point. \n\nThe question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Will tried to communicate the importance of leaving on time. He gave a specific time and waited until the last minute. He left to avoid being late to the wedding, which could be seen as respecting the event's schedule. However, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling and being disrespectful. That's a problem because even if frustrated, yelling is not acceptable. \n\nJill's side is that she's not a punctual person and maybe this is a recurring issue. She might feel that Will isn't being supportive or patient. The fact that he left without her might be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. But Will's intention was to not be late, which he views as rude. \n\nThe key factors here are the communication and the yelling. Even if Will had good intentions, raising his voice was inconsiderate. Leaving someone behind might be a result of his frustration, but it's a severe action. However, he did set a clear time and waited until the limit. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The yelling is definitely a fault. Leaving without her might be a consequence of his frustration, but it's a significant action. The fact that he left her at home might be seen as not being supportive. However, the wedding is an important event, and punctuality is a valid concern. \n\nThe community might split here. Some might say Will is right to avoid being late but wrong for yelling and abandoning Jill. Others might say Jill should manage her time better, but the yelling and leaving her are inexcusable. \n\nI think the main issue is the yelling and the decision to leave her. Even if he had a reason, the way he handled it was poor. So the answer would be that he's in the wrong (A) because of the yelling and the action of leaving her, despite the intention to be punctual.\n"
