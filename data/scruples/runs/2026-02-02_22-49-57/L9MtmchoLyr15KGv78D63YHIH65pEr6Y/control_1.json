Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was going to a wedding 30 minutes away starting at 4:30. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't great at time management, and they often end up late. The author, the fianc\u00e9, told her they needed to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready, clothes were still slightly damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice and left her at 4:00, saying he'd meet her there. She's mad because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled. He thinks she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was trying to be on time, which he values. He gave a clear deadline. Jill didn't meet it, which led to his frustration. He left her behind to not be late. But he raised his voice, which is a point against him. Also, he told her the clothes would be dry, but maybe that's part of the problem? Wait, he said \"probably but up to you,\" so maybe he didn't guarantee it. But she trusted him and got naked assuming they'd be dry. Now, she's upset about that. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he was stressed about being late, which is understandable, especially for a formal event like a wedding where punctuality is important. He gave a clear time to leave, and Jill didn't meet it. He left to not be late, which could be seen as taking responsibility. On the other hand, he raised his voice, which is unkind, and he left her, which might be considered abandoning her. Also, maybe he should have checked in more or helped her get ready instead of just leaving. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? The AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit often looks at intentions and actions. The author had good intentions of being on time, but his actions were harsh (yelling and leaving). The fianc\u00e9e's issue is that she felt disrespected and the author didn't support her during the situation. However, the author might feel he's not in the wrong since he tried to communicate the need for punctuality. \n\nIn similar situations, people often say that communication is key. The author did communicate the time, but maybe not effectively. The fact that they have this conversation often suggests a recurring issue. The author's reaction (yelling) was inappropriate. Leaving her could be seen as not standing by her during a stressful time. However, the wedding is important, and arriving late could be considered disrespectful to the hosts. \n\nBalancing both sides: The author made a mistake by yelling, but leaving to not be late might be excusable if they could meet later. However, leaving her behind could cause her embarrassment if she arrives later. Also, the author should have considered that she might still be getting ready and maybe gone with her to get her something else. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were a bit of both. He's not entirely wrong for wanting to be on time, but his handling of the situation (yelling and leaving) was flawed. However, the fianc\u00e9e's repeated time management issues are part of the problem. The answer might be that both have some faults, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards Yes (A) because he left her and raised his voice, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
