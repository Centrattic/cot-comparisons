Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, which leads to them often being late. He values punctuality and thinks it's rude to be late. The specific incident was a wedding starting at 4:30 PM. They had discussed leaving by 3:45 PM, but when that time came, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nJill is upset because he called her impatient, said the clothes would dry, and yelled at her. The author believes she's being defensive because she's in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and how each party handled the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and gave a heads-up. Jill didn't meet that deadline, leading to the conflict. The author left to avoid being late and to respect the event's timing. He also took steps to prepare the laundry, which might have been part of the problem since the clothes were only slightly dry.\n\nOn the other hand, the author raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, which is unkind. Even if frustrated, raising his voice could be seen as disrespectful. Additionally, he might have been more understanding of Jill's situation instead of leaving abruptly. However, he did wait until 4:00 PM before leaving, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. The fact that the clothes were damp suggests that maybe the author's initial estimate about the laundry was incorrect, which Jill might have pointed out, leading to her feeling he was inconsiderate.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for each side. The author's reasoning is that Jill was at fault for not managing her time, leading to the lateness. He left to avoid being late, which he views as important. However, his response (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. Jill's response might stem from feeling that he didn't support her, was impatient, and didn't account for the fact that his laundry estimate was wrong, making her clothes not dry as he assured.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have been more patient and communicated better instead of yelling. Jill, on the other hand, didn't meet the agreed time, contributing to the problem. The author left to be punctual, but his method might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. While he had a valid concern about lateness, his response of raising his voice and leaving alone could be seen as crossing a line. Relationships require mutual respect and support, and this incident might have lacked that. However, Jill's own time management issues are a problem too. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on his actions, then yelling and leaving might be seen as his fault. If the focus is on Jill's failure to meet the deadline, then maybe he's not wrong. But since the question asks if he's in the wrong, I think the consensus would lean towards A (Yes), because his response was harsh, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
