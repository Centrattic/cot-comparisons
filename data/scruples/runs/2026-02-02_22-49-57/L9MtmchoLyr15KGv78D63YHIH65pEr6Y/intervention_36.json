Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home so he could attend a wedding on time. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at managing time, they often get stressed over being late, and he values punctuality. He gave her a heads-up to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready until 4:00, with clothes still slightly damp. He waited until 4:00, got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. \n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled. The author believes she's deflecting because she knows she's at fault.\n\nNow, considering the key points: Did he handle the situation well? He did give a clear timeline and reminder, but he also raised his voice, which is a problem. Leaving without her might have been necessary to avoid being late, but the way he handled it\u2014getting angry\u2014might have contributed to the conflict. However, the core issue is time management. He prioritized punctuality, which he sees as respectful, while she might feel he's being overly strict. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did leave her behind intentionally, which could be seen as abandonment. But given the context, maybe he felt it was the only option. The fact that he left her to avoid being late might be justified from his perspective, but the way he handled the frustration (yelling) complicates things. The question is whether his actions were reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he could have compromised, like leaving without her but ensuring she had a way to get there later, or giving her more time but delaying his arrival. But he chose to leave, which he thought was necessary. The community might split on this. Some may see his impatience and raising his voice as problematic, while others might empathize with his need to be on time. \n\nIn the end, since he left to avoid being late and gave her prior notice, but the yelling and the stress might make him partially at fault. However, the main action of leaving might not be wrong if punctuality was a priority. Given the options, I think the answer leans towards B (No), because he tried to communicate, left as a last resort, but maybe the yelling was an issue. But since the question is about being in the wrong for leaving, not the yelling, maybe the answer is B.\n"
