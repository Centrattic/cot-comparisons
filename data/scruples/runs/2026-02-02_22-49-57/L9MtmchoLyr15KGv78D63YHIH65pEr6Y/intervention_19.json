Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about being late, which he finds disrespectful. He warned Jill about the time they needed to leave, and she assured him she'd be ready. But when the time came, she wasn't, and he left. He raised his voice, which he acknowledges was wrong, but then left her to go to the wedding without her.\n\nJill's side is that she's not good at budgeting time, which is a recurring issue. She might feel that he's being impatient and that he didn't handle the situation well, like maybe not helping her get ready instead of just leaving. She's also upset about the yelling and the clothes not being dry as he said.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author did give a clear warning about the departure time. Jill had a history of similar issues. He waited until 4:00 before leaving, which is 15 minutes past the initial deadline. He raised his voice, which is a point against him. However, the main question is whether leaving her at home was wrong.\n\nLeaving someone behind might be seen as abandoning them in a stressful situation. Even if she was responsible for her own punctuality, perhaps he should have handled it differently. Maybe he could have tried to help her get ready instead of leaving. But he was frustrated, and he felt it was important to be on time. There's a balance between respecting commitments and supporting a partner.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as harsh, but maybe not entirely in the wrong since he tried to warn her. However, the way he handled it (yelling and leaving) could be problematic. The community might have mixed opinions. Some might side with him because he had a valid reason to be on time, while others might say he should have been more supportive. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether his actions were unreasonable. If he prioritized punctuality over his partner's well-being, that's a red flag. But if he made a judgment call based on past experiences, maybe not. The fact that he left her alone could be seen as inconsiderate. However, he did wait an extra 15 minutes. Maybe the answer hinges on the yelling and leaving versus the circumstances. Since he left her, some might say he's in the wrong. Others might consider the recurring issue and his frustration. \n\nI think the community often looks at communication and effort. If he had tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving, that would be better. But he did wait, and maybe he had a valid reason. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he tried to warn her and left to avoid being late, but others might see it as selfish. However, the act of leaving her might be the asshole part. So maybe A (Yes, he's in the wrong). \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. If he left her alone, even if she was responsible for her time, it's still unkind. Maybe he should have taken her to the wedding or waited longer. Alternatively, maybe he had a right to be on time. It's a tough call. But given that he left her alone, not considering her feelings or helping, maybe he's in the wrong. So A.\n"
