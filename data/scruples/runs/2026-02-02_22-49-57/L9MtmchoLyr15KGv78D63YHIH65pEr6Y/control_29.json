Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding started at 4:30 PM, and they were supposed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. The author set a clear deadline, but Jill wasn't ready on time. The author got upset, raised their voice, and then left at 4:00 PM, saying they'd meet there. Now, Jill is upset, thinking the author is impatient, didn't account for the clothes not drying, and was mean by yelling.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. They gave Jill a heads-up at 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. That's a generous amount of time for a 30-minute drive. The author even asked if she needed to do laundry and mentioned the time constraint. Jill said she'd be fine. The author's intention was to be on time and not disrupt the wedding, which is understandable. However, when Jill wasn't ready, the author waited until 4:00 PM (15 minutes past the deadline) and then left. \n\nThe key points here are communication and the handling of the situation. The author did set a clear expectation. But when Jill didn't meet it, their response was to raise their voice and then leave. Yelling in frustration is a problem because it's a form of yelling, which can escalate tensions. However, the author also tried to be considerate by waiting until 4:00 PM instead of immediately leaving at 3:45 PM. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill is responsible for her own actions. She was supposed to start preparing in time to finish by 3:45 PM. If her clothes were slightly damp, maybe she didn't start the laundry on time or didn't account for the drying time. The author's job is to hold her accountable for that, but the way they did it\u2014raising their voice\u2014might have been inappropriate. \n\nBut the author also made a choice to leave. That could be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't check in with Jill again after the initial 3:45 PM time. Maybe they could have given her another 5 minutes or tried to communicate better. However, they did wait until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes after the deadline. The wedding was in 30 minutes, so maybe the author thought that leaving at 4:00 PM was necessary to avoid being late. \n\nThe author might argue that they were respecting the commitment to the wedding by leaving on time, but leaving their partner behind is a tough call. It could be seen as a failure to support each other in the relationship. However, Jill also has a responsibility to meet the agreed-upon time. \n\nThe fact that the author raised their voice is a significant factor. Even if frustrated, yelling is not a good approach. That's a common issue in relationships where one person feels responsible for the other's actions and expresses frustration poorly. \n\nSo, considering both sides, is the author in the wrong? They did set clear expectations, but their response to the situation was to yell and then leave. Leaving someone behind, even if they're responsible for the lateness, can be hurtful. However, Jill's own behavior in not meeting the deadline is also a problem. \n\nI think the author is partly in the wrong because of the yelling and the decision to leave. While they had the right intention to be on time, their method of handling the situation wasn't ideal. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, and the author's response might have been too harsh. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because Jill also was at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and their actions (yelling and leaving) likely make them so.\n"
