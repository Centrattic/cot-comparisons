Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to the wedding.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't managing her time well. The author told her they needed to leave by 3:45 latest to be on time. Jill said she could be ready, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to make sure they didn't arrive as the ceremony started. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and yelled at her. The author thinks Jill is in the wrong for being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility, communication, and actions taken under stress. The author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45) based on the distance and event time. Jill didn't meet that deadline, leading the author to make a split-second decision to leave. The author's frustration led to yelling, which is a problem. But was the decision to leave justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author wanted to be punctual and avoid being late, which is respectful to others. They had given a clear time frame and warned Jill. If Jill didn't start on time, she was responsible for her own preparation. However, by leaving, the author didn't account for Jill's possible delays and might have expected her to meet the time without considering her ability to manage it. Also, yelling adds emotional harm beyond the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid concern about being on time. Leaving alone to avoid being late could also be seen as a reasonable decision to honor commitments. But the way it was handled\u2014raising their voice and not ensuring Jill was ready\u2014complicates things.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of leaving might be seen as a consequence of Jill's failure to meet the deadline, but the author could have handled it differently, like staying and helping Jill get ready instead of leaving. Also, the yelling is a red flag. Even if the author's intention was to be punctual, the method involved being mean and possibly abandoning their partner in a stressful situation.\n\nIn relationships, communication and support are key. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response was harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to stay and help or at least wait longer with empathy. The author's action of leaving could be seen as selfish in the moment, prioritizing punctuality over their partner's needs, especially since they were both going together.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author gave a clear deadline, Jill didn't meet it, but the author's response included yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill's readiness. The author might share some responsibility for not following up or helping, rather than taking the harsh action. Therefore, the answer is likely AITA for the author, meaning answer A.\n"
