Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a similar conversation before about getting ready on time. The event was a wedding, which starts at 4:30. The author told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 latest. She said she'd be okay. At 3:45, she's still not ready, her clothes are slightly damp (so laundry wasn't dry), and the author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves at 4:00, telling her to meet there.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're the AITA (Ask the Internet if you're the Asshole). The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, said the clothes would be dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's being defensive.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to evaluate the actions and intentions. The key points here are the frustration leading to raising their voice, the decision to leave without her, and the communication around the laundry.\n\nFirst, the author had warned Jill about the time, and she agreed she'd be ready. When she wasn't, the author got frustrated. Raising their voice is a red flag because yelling, even in frustration, can be disrespectful. However, the intention was to avoid being late, which is understandable in a formal event like a wedding.\n\nLeaving Jill at home might be seen as abandoning her, but the author's reasoning was to not miss part of the ceremony. However, perhaps there was a better way to handle it, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready. But the author left at 4:00, 30 minutes before the event started, so maybe time was a factor.\n\nThe author also mentioned that the laundry was supposed to be dry. If they told Jill the clothes would be dry and it wasn't, that's a point where the author might be at fault for perhaps overestimating the drying time, leading to her being unprepared.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the author's reaction\u2014raising their voice and leaving. Even if Jill is at fault for not managing her time, yelling and leaving without her could be seen as harsh. The author should have handled the stress better, maybe without yelling, and perhaps found another solution instead of leaving her alone.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The author's actions were reactive, but the way they handled it might have been too extreme. The fianc\u00e9e's poor time management is a problem, but the author's response could also be considered impulsive and not considering the consequences for Jill.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions, especially the yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill was okay, might make them at least partially at fault. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. It's a judgment call, but I think the author's actions, while understandable in frustration, were not the best way to handle the situation, making them at least partially responsible. But since the question is binary, A or B, I need to decide if they're in the wrong.\n\nGiven that the author left the fianc\u00e9e alone, which could be seen as abandoning her, and the yelling, even if in frustration, it's likely that the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
