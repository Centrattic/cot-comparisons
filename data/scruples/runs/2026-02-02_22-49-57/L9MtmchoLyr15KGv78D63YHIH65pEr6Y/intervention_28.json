Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late often. He wanted to avoid being late, so he set a strict 3:45 PM departure time. However, when the time came, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were just drying, and she was still in the house. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author tried to set a time and warned her ahead of time. Jill didn't take it seriously, leading to the conflict. But did the author overreact? He did raise his voice, which is unkind, but the main issue is that he left her. However, he didn't physically abandon her; he met her at the wedding later. But leaving a partner at home because they're not ready on time might be seen as harsh, especially if she was relying on him to meet her there.\n\nAnother angle: Was he prepared to wait longer? He waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes past the set time. That's reasonable? Maybe not. If the wedding starts at 4:30, a 30-minute drive, leaving at 3:45 gives a 15-minute buffer. But maybe 3:45 is tight. If traffic or other delays happen, maybe they should have left earlier. But the author tried to set the time in advance. Jill didn't manage her time properly. \n\nBut the author's response was to leave her behind. That could be seen as abandoning her, even if just temporarily. However, he did meet her there, so it wasn't a complete abandonment. The fianc\u00e9e's anger comes from feeling that he was impatience and unkind. The author argues she's defensive because she knows she's wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author is partly at fault for raising his voice, but leaving her because they were going to be late is a judgment call. If the wedding was important, maybe he should have waited longer or communicated better. But given that they have this issue often, he might feel justified in setting strict times. \n\nHowever, in relationships, communication and understanding are key. The author could have handled the stress better, maybe by discussing the problem earlier or finding a compromise. But the act of leaving her might be seen as the wrong choice because it's not supportive. Alternatively, if being on time is a core value, he might be right to enforce it. \n\nI think the community would split. Some might say the author is right to hold his fianc\u00e9e accountable, others might say he overstepped by leaving her. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on the perspective. But since the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, I need to decide if B is correct.\n\nIn AITA threads, the consensus often considers intention and actions. The author tried to set expectations, but the outcome was harsh. Maybe the author is partially at fault for yelling, but not for leaving. However, leaving a person behind could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is B (No) because the main issue is Jill's time management, but the author's reaction (yelling) is a problem. However, the act of leaving her might be seen as wrong. Hmm. It's a tough call, but I think the answer is B because the main fault lies with Jill, but the author's response was unkind. Wait, but the question is about being in the wrong. If the author did something wrong by leaving, then A. But if he's not, B. Since he did raise his voice, which he admits is a wrongdoing, but the main issue is leaving. If leaving is acceptable, then B. Otherwise A. The key is whether leaving her at home was wrong. If he met her there later, maybe not. But if the wedding was in 30 minutes and she was still in the house, maybe it's understandable. The community often sides with the person who has the valid reason. Here, the author's reason is avoiding being late. So maybe B (No).\n"
