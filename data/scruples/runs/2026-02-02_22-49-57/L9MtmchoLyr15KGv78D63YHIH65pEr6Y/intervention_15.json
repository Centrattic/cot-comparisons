Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and expectations.\n\nFirst, the background: They have a history of being late because Jill isn't good at budgeting her time. The author mentions they often have this kind of discussion, which suggests this isn't an isolated incident. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to be on time. He also reminded her to start getting ready two hours before. However, at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were still drying, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, looking at both sides. The author was concerned about punctuality, which he sees as respectful. He set a clear deadline and gave a heads-up. Jill, on the other hand, didn't meet the deadline and is upset about being left. She's arguing that he was impatient and mean for yelling. The author feels she's being defensive because he believes she's the one who messed up the timeline.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, raising his voice in frustration could be seen as losing his temper, which might have been unnecessary. However, the context is that they have this recurring issue, and he's trying to manage their time to meet the commitment. Leaving her to go to the wedding on time could be seen as upholding the promise to others, but it also left her in an awkward situation. There's a communication issue here; maybe he should have discussed the problem with her first before leaving. But given the repeated nature of the problem, maybe his actions were a reaction to her consistent inability to meet deadlines. The question is whether his response was proportionate. Yelling might have been uncalled for, but the decision to leave might be his way of enforcing punctuality. However, leaving her alone in that state could be considered inconsiderate. So there's a mix of right and wrong here. The author's actions were driven by his commitment to punctuality, but the method could have been better. The answer might be that he's partially at fault for yelling but not entirely wrong for wanting to keep the appointment. The final answer would need to balance these factors.\n"
