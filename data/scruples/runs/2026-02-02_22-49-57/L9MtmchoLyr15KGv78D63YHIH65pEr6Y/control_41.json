Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, didn't manage her time well, and the author, let's call him Will, got frustrated and left her.\n\nFirst, the wedding starts at 4:30, and they need to leave by 3:45 to make it on time. Will warned Jill at 1:30 to start getting ready because they needed to leave by 3:45. But Jill wasn't ready by 4:00, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. Will got upset, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00. \n\nNow, the key points here: Will had given a clear deadline and warning. Jill had been told multiple times that being on time is important to him. However, she didn't manage her time properly. Will, frustrated by the recurring issue, left her. But he did raise his voice, which might be a point against him. \n\nOn one hand, Will was trying to be responsible and respectful to the wedding by not being late. He set a clear time, which is reasonable. On the other hand, leaving her alone when she's still getting ready might be harsh, especially if she's not done. Also, raising his voice could be seen as losing his temper. \n\nBut considering that they're engaged, this is a close relationship. Leaving her might not be the solution. Maybe he could have handled it differently, like helping her get ready or explaining the consequences of being late. However, Jill's consistent time management issues are part of the problem here. \n\nThe question is whether Will is at fault. The fact that he left her could be seen as abandonment, especially if she was in a vulnerable state (naked). But he might feel that he was doing the right thing to respect the event's timing. \n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up. The author might be in the wrong for raising his voice and leaving her, but Jill is also at fault for not managing her time. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he did raise his voice and left her, even if justified by the time constraints, it's possible he's partially at fault. But maybe not entirely. The community might split, but generally, in these situations, people might lean towards the author being in the wrong for his actions, even if Jill contributed to the problem. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation by yelling and leaving her, even if the root issue was her time management. However, there's nuance here. But according to typical AITA standards, he might be considered at fault for his reaction.\n"
