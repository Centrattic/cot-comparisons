Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they were supposed to attend. \n\nFirst, the wedding starts at 4:30 PM, and they live 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hits, she's still not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, saying they'll meet there. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nNow, considering the timeline: leaving by 3:45 would give them exactly 30 minutes to get there, which is tight but possible. Jill's clothes were supposed to be in the dryer, but they came out slightly damp. The author had warned her about the time, but she didn't take it seriously. He got frustrated and left. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to be punctual and respects other people's time. He gave multiple warnings, and Jill didn't heed them. His frustration led to yelling, which is a problem, but the situation might have been unavoidable given their repeated issues with time management. However, leaving her alone when she's not ready could be seen as abandoning her, even if she's at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill is responsible for her own preparation. She assured him she'd be ready, but didn't take the time seriously. The author's reaction of yelling and leaving might have been too harsh, but given the history of this issue, he might feel justified. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. While Jill's actions contributed to the problem, the author's response of yelling and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the situation is stressful, taking off without ensuring her safety or well-being could be problematic. However, if the author made it clear multiple times and she ignored the warnings, he might have a point. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, communication is key. He could have handled the frustration differently, maybe by staying and helping her get ready instead of leaving. Also, making a public appearance by himself might cause embarrassment for both. However, if they're both adults and she's responsible for her own actions, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his actions were reasonable given the circumstances. He did warn her, she didn't listen, and he had a valid reason to be upset. But leaving her alone when she's in a vulnerable state might still be seen as inconsiderate. The yelling is a red flag either way. So, while Jill is partly at fault, the author's actions might still make him the wronged party. But maybe he's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
