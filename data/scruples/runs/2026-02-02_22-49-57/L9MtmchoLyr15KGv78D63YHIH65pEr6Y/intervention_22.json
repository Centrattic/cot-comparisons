Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding they were supposed to attend.\n\nFirst, the background: They had a history of Jill being late, and the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about punctuality. He set a clear deadline (3:45) for leaving. Jill didn't meet that, and he left without her, getting upset and raising his voice.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The fianc\u00e9 gave a heads up about the deadline. Jill agreed she would be ready. When she wasn't, he left. But he did raise his voice, which could be seen as yelling. The question is whether he was wrong to leave her or to raise his voice.\n\nFrom his perspective, he was trying to be on time, which is respectful to the event. He communicated the time clearly. But Jill might feel he was impatient and maybe didn't support her enough. The fact that he left her at home could be seen as abandoning her, but maybe he thought she'd just get there later. However, weddings are social events, and arriving late can be awkward, especially if you're a couple. Leaving her alone might cause her embarrassment or stress.\n\nThe author's main actions are leaving and raising his voice. Yelling is a red flag in relationships; even if frustrated, that's not a good approach. But the leaving part\u2014maybe he thought it was the only option to not be late. But was he wrong to leave her behind? It's a tough call. If he left her at home, maybe he should have waited a bit more or offered help instead of just leaving. However, given their history, maybe he felt it was the only solution.\n\nIn terms of budgeting time, Jill's responsibility is to be ready on time. But the fianc\u00e9 could have handled the frustration better. The yelling is definitely his fault, but the leaving\u2014maybe not entirely his fault since he followed the agreed time. However, leaving her alone could be considered inconsiderate, as she might have been stressed already. \n\nSo, the author might be partially in the wrong for yelling, but the main question is about leaving her. If the answer is whether he's in the wrong overall, maybe it's a mix. But the user's question is specifically about leaving her. If he left and she was still getting ready, maybe he didn't have a choice, but perhaps he could have handled it differently. The answer might be a bit of both, but the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given the setup, maybe the answer is B (no), because he followed the time he set, but he did raise his voice. But the main issue is leaving her. If the act of leaving her is the focus, maybe he's not wrong, but the yelling is. Since the user's question is about leaving her, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit conflicted because leaving someone behind could be seen as wrong, especially if it's a partner. However, given the circumstances, perhaps he's not wrong.\n"
