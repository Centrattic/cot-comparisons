Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's engaged to Jill, left her at home before going to a wedding because they were going to be late. The key points are the timeline, communication, and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the wedding started at 4:30 and they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. The author mentioned this to Jill earlier, but she thought she could manage. At 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are damp, and he gets frustrated. He raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves alone.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to be respectful by not being late and is frustrated because this is a recurring issue. He took the initiative to leave to avoid being late to the wedding. Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and left her. She feels he's impatient.\n\nNow, who's at fault? The author gave a heads-up about the time, but maybe he didn't check in more often to see if Jill was on track. However, Jill didn't meet the deadline she was given. The author's frustration is understandable, but raising his voice might have been unnecessary. Leaving her alone might have been a harsh reaction, but he did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. \n\nThe author could have handled the situation better without yelling, but Jill is also responsible for not managing her time. The question is whether leaving was wrong. Since he prioritized punctuality, which is a valid concern, especially for an important event like a wedding. He might not be in the wrong, but his reaction (yelling) and leaving could have been handled more considerately. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong for leaving, maybe not. Jill's time management is her responsibility. However, the way he left might have been harsh. Still, the main issue is that he left to be on time. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. The community might split, but the author isn't entirely at fault here.\n"
