Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple was supposed to attend a wedding starting at 4:30 PM, located 30 minutes away. The fianc\u00e9, let's call him Will, gave a heads up at 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be fine. However, at 3:45 PM, she wasn't ready, her clothes were just slightly dry, and she was naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset because he got angry, said the clothes would be dry (which they weren't), and called him mean. Will thinks she's in the wrong for not being ready on time.\n\nTo determine if Will is in the wrong, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, Will had previously warned her about the time constraints, and she didn't take it seriously. Being late could be seen as disrespectful to the event, so he wanted to make sure they arrived on time. He tried to plan ahead, gave her a heads up, and even offered to help with the laundry. His frustration might be justified if this is a recurring issue where Jill consistently underestimates the time she needs.\n\nOn the other hand, when things didn't go as planned, Will's response was to raise his voice and leave his fianc\u00e9e. Even if she was at fault, his reaction could be seen as harsh. Leaving her alone, especially in that state (naked, not ready), might be emotionally hurtful. Also, he mentioned the clothes would be dry earlier, but they weren't, which could have contributed to the situation. His impatience and yelling might have been unnecessary, even if the stress of the situation was high.\n\nAnother point is communication. Will waited until 4:00 PM, but maybe he could have handled it differently. Instead of yelling and leaving, he could have tried to help her get ready faster, or at least communicated more calmly. Leaving her alone might have been a knee-jerk reaction, which isn't the best approach in a relationship. Trust and support are important, and his actions might have hurt Jill's feelings, even if she made a mistake in time management.\n\nHowever, the wedding scenario does require punctuality, and Will's intention was to respect the event's timing. If this is a pattern where Jill often isn't ready, Will might be trying to prevent repeated lateness. But his method of dealing with the current situation might not be healthy. Relationships require compromise and understanding, and both parties need to work on their roles in the conflict.\n\nSo, considering both sides, Will might share some responsibility. He could have handled the frustration better without raising his voice or leaving her. At the same time, Jill's poor time management led to the problem. It's a mutual issue, but since the question is about whether the author (Will) is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because his reaction was inappropriate, even if the situation was caused by Jill's actions. However, others might argue it's not entirely his fault because he tried to plan ahead. But the act of leaving her alone and yelling are his direct actions that harmed the situation, so he's at least partially at fault.\n"
