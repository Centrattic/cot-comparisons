Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario, so the community's opinion is usually mixed, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They wanted to be punctual because they find lateness disrespectful. They gave a heads-up about the 3:45 deadline. Jill, the fianc\u00e9e, assured them she would be ready. When she wasn't, the author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, before the 4:30 start time. The author argues that Jill was at fault for not being ready on time and for being defensive, so they aren't the one in the wrong.\n\nJill's side: She's upset because the author called her impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (which they weren't), and was mean by yelling. She might feel that the author didn't support her or help her get ready instead of leaving her, which could be seen as abandonment or not being a team player in a relationship.\n\nNow, considering the details. The author did set a clear time to leave (3:45) and gave a warning. Jill said she'd be ready, but was still not ready even at 4:00. The author waited 15 minutes past the deadline. However, the author's action of leaving without her might be harsh, especially since they are engaged. The yelling adds to the conflict. While the author has valid concerns about punctuality, the way they handled it (leaving Jill alone) could be seen as inconsiderate. Relationships often require compromise and support, even during stressful situations. The author's frustration is understandable, but the solution of leaving might have caused more harm than good. Jill's defensiveness could be due to feeling abandoned or that her needs weren't considered. The author might be in the wrong for not finding another solution, like staying and helping her finish getting ready, even if she was late. But the user's own analysis thinks the author isn't in the wrong. However, from a relationship perspective, leaving a partner alone in that situation might not be the best approach. So the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the harsh action of leaving despite the conflict, or B (No) if the author's intention was to prevent being late and they set clear expectations.\n"
