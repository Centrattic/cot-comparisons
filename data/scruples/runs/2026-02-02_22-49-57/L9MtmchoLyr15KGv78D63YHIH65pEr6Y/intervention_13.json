Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. The author explains that they've had this issue before, where Jill underestimates the time needed to get ready. They gave her a heads-up to start early, but she didn't, and when they got frustrated and left, Jill is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests, which is important. They had warned Jill about the time, so there's some communication there. But they also raised their voice in frustration. Then, when they left, Jill felt disrespected because the author told her clothes would be dry (but they weren't), and they were mean by yelling. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid reason to be on time and tried to manage the situation. On the other hand, raising their voice and leaving Jill alone could be seen as harsh. However, the core issue might be Jill's repeated time management problems, which the author has addressed before. The author might be trying to set boundaries given their past experiences. \n\nBut is leaving someone at home the right action? The author did give a warning and waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the deadline. They couldn't wait any longer, but instead of staying and being late, they decided to leave. That shows they prioritized being on time, which is understandable, but maybe the way they handled it was too abrupt. The yelling is a problem, as it's unkind and adds to the conflict. \n\nHowever, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that they were trying to avoid being late and had warned Jill. Jill is upset because she felt disrespected. But the author's action was a consequence of previous issues. Maybe the author is too strict, but given the context, they might not be entirely in the wrong. The key points are the prior warnings, the frustration leading to yelling, and the decision to leave. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to find a better way to handle the situation without yelling. But the act of leaving, while harsh, might be seen as a consequence of Jill's repeated behavior. So, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the note that their approach could be improved.\n"
