Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. So the user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9, let's call him Will) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: They were supposed to attend a wedding starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes away. Will warned Jill multiple times to start getting ready in time, and by 3:45 PM, she wasn't ready. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM to get there on time. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the main points here. Will tried to communicate the time they needed to leave (3:45 latest) and gave a heads-up. Jill, according to him, is not good at time management. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline, and then left. He raised his voice, which he admits was a wrongdoing. The question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving her.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, Will was trying to be punctual, which he values. He gave multiple warnings and tried to help by offering to do the laundry if needed. He waited longer than the deadline he set and then left, which shows he tried to be patient. On the other hand, raising his voice was inappropriate, and leaving her alone might have been harsh, especially if she was still in the process of getting ready. However, he left because he didn't want to be late to the event. \n\nJill's perspective is that she was still getting ready and expected him to stay. She might feel that he didn't support her enough, like ensuring her clothes were dry. But Will mentioned that he told her the clothes might be dry by the wedding time, so he did set that expectation. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual understanding. Will communicated the time constraints, but Jill might not have taken them seriously. However, leaving her alone could be seen as abandoning her, even if he was worried about being late. But considering that they were both going to the same event, he might have expected her to eventually get ready and meet him there. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. Raising his voice was a mistake, and that could have been handled better. But the act of leaving\u2014was that a reasonable action? If he left to avoid being late, but she was going to arrive later, perhaps he should have waited a bit longer or helped her instead of leaving. However, he waited 15 minutes past the deadline, which is a significant amount of time. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether leaving was a reasonable action given the circumstances. Since he left to maintain punctuality and had communicated his concerns, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he should have stayed to help her finish and then they both leave together. However, given that he was already stressed and waited until 4:00, maybe his actions are understandable, and the yelling was the main issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the note that his yelling was a mistake. The leaving itself was a consequence of his frustration and trying to adhere to punctuality, which he had communicated in advance. Jill's time management issues led to the situation, so the primary responsibility lies there. However, the way he handled the frustration (raising his voice) was inappropriate, but the act of leaving might not make him the wrongdoer.\n"
