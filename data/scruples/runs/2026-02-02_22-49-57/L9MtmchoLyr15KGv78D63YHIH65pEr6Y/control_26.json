Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: They were supposed to attend a wedding starting at 4:30. The fianc\u00e9e (Jill) isn't good with time management. They discussed leaving by 3:45 to arrive on time. At 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated. He yells, waits until 4:00, leaves without her, and she's upset.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the final action. The author had warned her to start early, but she didn't. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. He might be right in wanting to be on time, but yelling and leaving could be seen as harsh. However, he did wait until 4:00, which was 15 minutes past the agreed departure time. But leaving her at home without a ride might be the real issue. If he left and she couldn't get there, that's a problem. Also, the argument is whether he should have been more patient or handled it differently. He might think she's defensive because she knows she's late, but his action of leaving could be seen as abandoning her, which isn't ideal. On the other hand, she didn't take the initial warning seriously. It's a mix of both being at fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The act of leaving her stranded might make him at fault. So maybe A (he's in the wrong) because he left her without ensuring she could still get there, even if she was late.\n"
