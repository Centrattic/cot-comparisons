Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The fianc\u00e9, let's call him Will, mentions that Jill isn't good with time management. He's concerned about being late, which he sees as rude. He gave her a clear deadline (3:45 to leave by 4:00) but she wasn't ready. He raised his voice in frustration and left her at home. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. Will set a specific time for them to leave, which Jill didn't meet. However, he also admitted to raising his voice, which can be seen as yelling. That's a problem because it adds to the tension. But was it wrong to leave her? Well, he wanted to make the event on time, which is understandable. However, leaving her there alone might have been a harsh reaction, especially if she wasn't ready yet. \n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and was mean. She might feel abandoned or that he didn't support her through the situation. On the other hand, Will is frustrated because he's trying to be punctual and is used to this pattern. \n\nI think both sides have some responsibility. Jill didn't manage her time as agreed, but Will's reaction of yelling and leaving could be seen as harsh. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left her there so they wouldn't be late, but maybe he should have handled it differently, like trying to help her get ready instead of leaving. \n\nBut in the end, the key is whether he's at fault. He did follow up with a deadline and warned her. However, leaving her there might be seen as abandoning her. However, the user's own analysis says he's not in the wrong, so maybe the answer is B. But I need to consider if his actions were justified. The fact that he yelled is definitely a negative point. But was leaving her the wrong part? Maybe. It's a tough call, but since he's the one who left her, maybe he's more at fault. Wait, but he wanted to make the event on time. Alternatively, he could have waited a bit longer or communicated better. However, given the time constraints, maybe he did what he thought was necessary. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there are elements on both sides. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and according to the situation, since he followed through on the deadline and tried to manage the situation, the answer is B.\n"
