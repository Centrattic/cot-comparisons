Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. \n\nFirst, the context: They were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM, and the author told Jill to start the laundry at 1:30 PM so it would dry by 3:45. They agreed she had to leave by 3:45. But at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM to avoid being late to the wedding.\n\nThe author is defending themselves by saying Jill is at fault for poor time management and being defensive. Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and yelled.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and expectations. In many cultures, punctuality is valued, especially for events like weddings. However, the author's method of handling the situation\u2014leaving without Jill\u2014might be seen as harsh. Raising their voice adds to the conflict. While Jill might have been unprepared, the author's decision to leave could have been handled more compassionately. There's a balance between being responsible and maintaining respect in a relationship. The author might be in the wrong for not finding a middle ground, like giving Jill a few more minutes or helping her get ready instead of just leaving. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to confirm.\n\nAlso, consider if there's any precedent in similar situations. People often argue that being late is disrespectful, but so is abandoning someone in a relationship crisis. The emotional impact on Jill is significant; she was left alone, and the author's actions could be seen as prioritizing the event over her feelings. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of resolution might not be. So, the answer is A.\n"
