Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who left their fianc\u00e9e at home so they wouldn't be late) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were going to a wedding 30 minutes away starting at 4:30. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a prior conversation where the author told her they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine. But at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, yells a bit, waits until 4:00, then leaves alone. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and yelled.\n\nThe author's defense is that they don't want to be late, which they see as rude. They think Jill is being defensive and knows she's wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know the community's take.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The author gave a clear deadline and warned her. Jill didn't manage her time well, leading to the delay. The author, to avoid being late, left her. The key points are: communication beforehand, the deadline, the frustration leading to yelling, and the act of leaving.\n\nPossible angles: The author might be in the wrong for yelling, which is a form of raising their voice in frustration. Even if the deadline is important, yelling can be seen as harsh. Also, leaving her might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). But the author's intention was to avoid being late, which they consider respectful to others.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's behavior is a recurring issue (as the author mentions they have this conversation a lot). The author tried to communicate the time constraints clearly. If Jill consistently isn't managing her time, maybe the author is justified in taking action. However, the method (yelling and leaving) could be problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions cross a line. If the main issue is that they left because Jill was late, but they had warned her, it's a bit of a gray area. But the yelling is a point against the author. However, some might argue that being late at a wedding is more important to avoid, and the author tried to be patient until the last minute.\n\nSo, considering all factors, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and the harsh action of leaving her, but others might see it as B (not in the wrong) due to the prior communication and the importance of punctuality. The community often splits on these, but in AITA scenarios, they often emphasize how the actions made the other person feel. Since Jill felt humiliated (naked, left alone), that might weigh more. Also, yelling is a clear negative. So leaning towards A.\n"
