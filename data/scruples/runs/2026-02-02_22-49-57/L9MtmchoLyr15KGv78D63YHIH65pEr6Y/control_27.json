Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the setup: The wedding starts at 4:30, 30 minutes away. They agreed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's still not ready. The author gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 to arrive on time.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author thinks Jill is in the wrong because she knew they had a time, and she didn't manage her time well. Jill is upset because he was impatient, lied about the clothes drying, and yelled at her. \n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's trying to be respectful to others by not being late, which he values. He set a clear deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he left. But he did raise his voice, which is a point against him. Also, he might have assumed the clothes would dry in time, but Jill's response was \"Will they be dry by then?\" and he said \"Probably but up to you.\" So maybe he wasn't certain, but Jill might have thought they would. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's perspective is that she trusted he'd make sure the laundry was done, and he left her in an unready state. The fact that he left her at home could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable moment (naked, not ready), which is not supportive. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he did set a clear time, and she didn't meet it. However, raising his voice is a form of yelling, which is unkind. Also, leaving her at home might have been a harsh response. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready, even if it meant being late. However, the event is important, and showing up late could be seen as disrespectful to the hosts and guests. \n\nThe key points are: Did he have a right to be frustrated? Possibly. Did he handle it appropriately? Raising his voice and leaving might not be the best approach. Also, the fact that he left her at home when she was in a state of undress and not ready could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made a mistake in yelling and leaving her, even if his intention was to be on time. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the harsh reaction and abandoning her, but there's a valid point about time management. However, the way he handled the situation, especially the yelling and leaving, is problematic.\n"
