Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They were supposed to attend a wedding starting at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. The author reminded Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. He mentioned the laundry situation earlier, and she said she'd be fine. But at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were still damp, and she was naked. He got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nNow, the key points here. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: He wanted to avoid being late, which he finds rude. He tried to set a time, but Jill didn't meet it. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. He left because he didn't want to be late for the wedding, which is understandable. But he raised his voice, which Jill took as being mean. She's upset because he was \"impatient,\" didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's perspective is that she wasn't ready, and the author left her. She might feel that he didn't support her, especially in a stressful situation. Maybe she was unprepared due to the laundry not drying, and he didn't help her, just got frustrated and left. The fact that he left her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry) might have made her feel embarrassed or abandoned.\n\nThe author argues that Jill was in the wrong for not managing her time better, but perhaps he could have handled the situation differently. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have tried to assist her in getting ready, offered to adjust their time, or communicated more calmly. Leaving her alone when she wasn't ready might be seen as cruel, regardless of her responsibility in the time management. \n\nAlso, the fact that they are engaged adds another layer. The author's action of leaving her alone in the house, especially when she was in a difficult situation, might be considered inconsiderate. He might have prioritized punctuality over her comfort and their relationship dynamics. \n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable. He values punctuality and had warned her multiple times. But the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014could have been more empathetic. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's response might be seen as harsh. \n\nSo considering all these points, the author might be partially at fault for the way he reacted, even if Jill was the one who wasn't ready. The key is whether the author's actions were disproportionate. Yelling and leaving her in that state could be seen as inconsiderate, hence him being in the wrong. But some might argue that he had a reason to prioritize the event's timing. \n\nBut in relationship advice, often communication and support are key. The author could have handled the situation better. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his response was not supportive and he left her in a vulnerable situation, despite her time management issues.\n"
