Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a prior conversation where he warned her to start early because they needed to leave by 3:45. She assured him she would be ready, but then at 3:45, she's still not dressed, clothes are only slightly dry. He gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves.\n\nThe author's main points are that he values punctuality, tried to set clear expectations, and when she didn't meet them, he left to avoid being late to the wedding. He feels she's being defensive because she knows she's at fault.\n\nJill's side is that he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry in time, and was mean by yelling. So she's upset about the raised voice and being left behind.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is a classic conflict between punctuality and time management. The author did set a clear deadline, but maybe he should have checked in more or helped her meet the time. However, he did warn her. When she didn't comply, leaving might have been his way to honor the commitment to the wedding. But raising his voice might have been unnecessary. \n\nBut the key question is whether leaving her was wrong. Since he left her at home to not be late, but she was the one who didn't meet the time she agreed to. He might be in the right because he held her to her word. However, he could have handled it differently without yelling. But the central issue is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. \n\nConsidering that he gave her a clear deadline, she didn't meet it, and he left to not be late, it seems he's not in the wrong. Jill's frustration comes from the yelling and the clothes not drying, but the main decision to leave was based on her not following through. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
