Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were supposed to attend a wedding 30 minutes from home, starting at 4:30. The author warned their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, that they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready yet\u2014still naked, clothes slightly damp. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, then left her at home to go to the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author tried to give a heads-up about the time. They mentioned the latest departure time as 3:45, which gives a 15-minute buffer. That seems reasonable. Jill, on the other hand, might have a history of poor time management, as the author says they have this conversation a lot. So maybe Jill knew she needed to start earlier but didn't, leading to her being unprepared.\n\nThe author got upset because they don't like being late and don't want to disrupt the wedding by arriving as the couple is walking down the aisle. They raised their voice in frustration, which is a problem. Yelling is never great, especially in a relationship. But the author also waited until 4:00 before leaving, which is 15 minutes past the 3:45 cutoff they set. However, the wedding starts at 4:30, so by leaving at 4:00, they might still be late? Wait, but the wedding is 30 minutes away. If they left at 3:45, they'd arrive at 4:15. If they left at 4:00, they'd arrive at 4:30, which is exactly on time. Maybe the author wanted to arrive before the start time to avoid being in the middle of the aisle walk. But the exact timing here is a bit unclear. \n\nThe author's main points are that Jill is at fault for not managing her time and being unprepared, while Jill argues that the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. The author did tell Jill the clothes would be dry by 3:45, but Jill's clothes were slightly damp at 3:45. The author's initial message was \"Probably but up to you,\" which might mean they thought the laundry would be dry, but Jill had to rely on that and maybe didn't account for the buffer. However, if the clothes were not dry by 3:45, maybe the author's assumption was wrong, but they had already given a heads-up. \n\nNow, the key issues are: 1) Did the author have a responsibility to wait past the agreed time despite the delay? 2) Was raising their voice an inconsiderate act? 3) Is it reasonable to leave to be on time when the other person isn't ready?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author set a clear time, but Jill insisted she'd be ready. The author left because they couldn't wait, which might be seen as prioritizing their own needs, but also respecting the event's schedule. However, yelling in the process is a clear mistake. Arguing that they were in the wrong for leaving might depend on how committed they are to being with their partner despite her time issues. But since the author tried to give a warning and then left after waiting 15 minutes, maybe they weren't unreasonable. The problem is the yelling and the fact that they left her to go alone, which might make Jill feel abandoned. \n\nSo, there's a mix here. The author tried to be considerate by setting a time, but the yelling is a red flag. However, the core issue is Jill's repeated poor time management. The author might not be in the wrong for leaving, but they should address the yelling. The answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that the author's behavior in raising their voice was inappropriate. The main question is whether leaving is a valid response when the partner isn't ready despite warnings. Since the author left as a result of Jill's failure to meet the agreed time, even though they were in a rush, it's a bit of a judgment call. But given that they waited 15 minutes after the cutoff, maybe they weren't too harsh. So leaning towards B.\n"
