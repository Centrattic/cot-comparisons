Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (let's call him Will) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding. From the description, Will and Jill were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM. They had a conversation earlier where Will warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill thought she could be ready, but she wasn't, so Will left at 4:00 to get there on time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will seems to be concerned about being on time, which he sees as respectful. He's probably stressed because they're often late. Jill, on the other hand, might feel that Will didn't trust her or was too strict. She's upset about being left alone, maybe feeling embarrassed or humiliated. \n\nNow, the key points: Did Will give her enough warnings? He told her to start at 2:30, and she said she'd be okay. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the planned departure. He raised his voice, which might have been unkind. Leaving her might have caused her to miss the wedding or feel abandoned. \n\nBut also, Will was trying to be punctual. However, leaving her alone when she wasn't ready could be seen as abandoning her in a situation where she needed help. Maybe he should have tried to help her get ready instead of leaving. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Like helping her get dressed or giving her a buffer time? He waited 15 minutes past the deadline, but maybe that wasn't enough. Also, raising his voice isn't helpful. So, while Jill's time management is an issue, Will's reaction could be seen as harsh. \n\nConsidering the social norms, sometimes people understand delays, but Will's approach might have been too abrupt. Leaving her might not be the best solution. So maybe Will is partially in the wrong. But he did try to communicate the plan. It's a bit of a gray area. I'm leaning towards AITA being more on Will's side because he left her in a vulnerable state, even if she was at fault for not being ready. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B is correct because he was trying to respect the schedule. Hmm.\n"
