Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a guy named Will, left his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill wasn't ready by 4:00, so he left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says Jill isn't good with time management and they often get into these situations. He tried to set a time (3:45) and reminded her that if she needed two hours, she should start earlier. She said she'd be fine, but obviously wasn't ready in time. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. Now Jill is upset because she thinks he was impatient, didn't ensure the laundry was dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, he did leave her behind to get to the wedding on time. But he had given her a deadline and she didn't meet it. He also mentions that this is a recurring issue. However, he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, which is a negative reaction. But maybe he felt justified because he was stressed about being late. On the other hand, leaving her naked and not ready might have been inconsiderate, but his intention was to be on time for the event.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author set a time, but maybe Jill didn't take it seriously. The author tried to warn her, but when she didn't meet the deadline, he acted. However, yelling might be a red flag. But given that it's a recurring problem, maybe his frustration is understandable. The question is whether leaving her was the wrong choice. Some might say he should have stayed to help her get ready instead of leaving, but others might agree that he had a responsibility to get to the wedding on time. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the author isn't entirely wrong because he communicated his expectations and tried to manage the time, but he could have handled the situation better without yelling. Since the main question is whether he's in the wrong, and there are valid points on both sides, but the author's actions were based on prior communication and a recurring issue, the answer might lean towards B (No). However, yelling does add a layer of wrongdoing. But the core issue is leaving her behind, which could be seen as necessary to meet the commitment. So, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
