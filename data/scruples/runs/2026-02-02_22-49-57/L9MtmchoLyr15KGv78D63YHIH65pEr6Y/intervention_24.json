Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the setup: The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author gave a heads-up that they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill was supposed to handle her laundry. The author warned her multiple times, and she said she'd be fine. However, at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he leaves, upset and frustrated. He raised his voice, which Jill points out as being mean. Now, Jill is mad because he was impatient, said clothes would dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's defensive and in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are time management, communication, and the immediate actions taken. The author tried to set clear expectations (leave by 3:45) and gave a heads-up about the timing. Jill didn't adhere to that, leading to the conflict. The author's frustration is understandable given the repeated issues with time. However, raising his voice and leaving without her could be seen as harsh, even if he's stressed. \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate the necessary time frame and warned her. Jill didn't follow through, possibly underestimating the time needed. On the other hand, leaving her behind, especially in a vulnerable state (naked, slightly damp clothes), might be seen as abandonment. Also, yelling adds emotional harm. \n\nBut the author's intention was to make it to the wedding on time, which is a valid concern. The problem might stem from differing priorities: he values punctuality and respect for others' time, while Jill might feel disrespected by his reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did follow through on his earlier warning by leaving at 3:45 when she wasn't ready. However, the yelling and the way he left could be problematic. The question is whether his actions were justified given the situation. Some might argue that he took responsibility for their punctuality and had to act on his own. Others might say that he should have handled the situation more calmly and with more support for Jill, especially given the emotional state she was in. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in raising his voice, which escalated the situation. However, leaving to be on time wasn't entirely his fault because he had given clear instructions and she didn't follow through. But the way he handled it (yelling and leaving her in that state) could be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe there's a mix here. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal values around punctuality vs. empathy. \n\nAlternatively, since he left her to be on time, but in a way that caused emotional distress, perhaps he's partially in the wrong. But the user thinks he's not, so I need to consider that. If the main issue is that he followed through on his responsibility despite her failure, then he's not in the wrong. But if the method of handling it (yelling and leaving) is the issue, then he's partially at fault. \n\nGiven that the user is asking for a binary choice (A or B), and the options are whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not. So I need to decide if the answer is B (No) or A (Yes). \n\nConsidering the facts again: He set the time, warned her. She didn't prepare. He left to be on time. But he yelled. The yelling is a problem. However, the core action of leaving might be seen as necessary. If the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the main issue is the yelling and not leaving her. But the user is the one who left, not Jill. \n\nI think the main fault lies with Jill for not managing her time, but the author's reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the question is whether he's in the wrong, then it's a mix. However, since he left to be on time as per their agreement, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
