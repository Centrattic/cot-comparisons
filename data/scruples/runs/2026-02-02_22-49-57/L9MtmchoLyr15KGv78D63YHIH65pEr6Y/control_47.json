Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home when they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that they often have issues with Jill's time management. He tried to set a time to leave (3:45 PM) but she wasn't ready until the clothes were only slightly dry. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. Now she's upset, saying he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are time management issues, communication, and the reaction. The author wanted to be punctual, which is reasonable. But he admitted he raised his voice, which could be seen as losing his temper. Leaving her alone might have been a harsh reaction, especially since she was still in the process of getting ready. However, the wedding is important, and showing up late could be seen as disrespectful to the hosts and guests.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of their recurring issues. The author mentions they have these conversations often, implying that Jill's time management isn't a one-time thing. The author tried to set a time in advance, but maybe didn't check in enough to see if she could meet that deadline. He said the clothes would be dry by 3:45, but that's an estimate and maybe he should have been more proactive in ensuring that happened, rather than just assuming she would handle it.\n\nLeaving her there might have been impulsive. A better approach might have been to stay and help her finish getting ready, or communicate more clearly about the urgency. Yelling also complicates things, as it adds emotional harm. Even if Jill is responsible for her time management, the author's reaction could be seen as part of the problem.\n\nHowever, the wedding start time is fixed, and arriving late disrupts the event. The author's intention was to respect the event's schedule, which is understandable. But the method he chose\u2014leaving her alone\u2014might not have been the best solution. It's possible that both parties have some responsibility here. Jill for not managing time better, and the author for not handling the situation with more patience and support.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks for who acted unreasonably. The author's frustration is valid given the recurring issues, but his reaction of yelling and leaving might cross the line. Jill, on the other hand, is defensive, which could indicate she sees her actions as reasonable. But she also contributed to the problem by not managing time effectively. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with enough support and patience. His yelling and leaving without a plan to help her finish could be seen as harsh. But Jill's time management is a factor too. However, given the question's structure, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because his actions directly caused the conflict, even if there's context.\n"
