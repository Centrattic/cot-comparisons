Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. They had a planned time to leave by 3:45 PM to arrive on time for a 4:30 PM wedding. The author had already warned Jill about leaving on time and reminded her to start her preparations early. Despite this, Jill wasn't ready by 4:00 PM, so the author left without her. He raised his voice in frustration, which he acknowledges as a mistake.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author's perspective is that he's trying to be punctual and respectful to others, which is important. He's tried communicating the importance of leaving on time multiple times. His action of leaving might come from a place of frustration with recurring issues where Jill isn't time-efficient. But he did raise his voice, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might feel that the author didn't support her or help her get ready, and instead of staying and helping, he left, making her handle everything alone. She's upset about the yelling and the fact that her clothes were still damp, even though he had mentioned the drying time. She might feel that the author was impatient and didn't consider her stress or the situation she was in.\n\nThe key points here are communication, repeated issues with time management, and the immediate action of leaving. The author had set clear expectations before, but Jill didn't meet them. However, the author's response was to raise his voice and leave, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. Leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her in a stressful moment, even if the intention was to be on time.\n\nBut the author did give her a clear deadline and had warned her multiple times. He also waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. So, from his perspective, he tried to be patient. The yelling is a fault, but the decision to leave might be a consequence of her not meeting the agreed time. However, leaving alone could have caused her more stress, and he didn't check if she was almost ready or offer to stay and help her finish.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some faults. Jill didn't manage her time well despite warnings, and the author didn't handle the situation calmly. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. Since the decision to leave was a direct result of her not meeting the time, which he had communicated clearly, perhaps he isn't entirely at fault. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might be seen as harsh. So, it's a bit of a gray area. Some might say he's in the wrong for not staying to help, others might see it as holding her accountable. But from a general perspective, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because he tried to communicate the importance of punctuality. However, there's a case for both sides.\n"
