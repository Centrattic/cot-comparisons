Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style story where he's the one who left her, and she's upset about it. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. She said she'd be fine. By 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated. He raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves her to go alone.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry, and yelled. The author argues she's being defensive because he's not in the wrong. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nTo evaluate this, I should consider both sides. The author's perspective: he wanted to be on time, had communicated the time they needed to leave, and felt she wasn't respecting their commitment. He raised his voice in frustration but left after waiting 15 minutes past the deadline. His reasoning is that punctuality is important and he didn't want to be late to a significant event.\n\nJill's perspective: She might feel that the author didn't support her, maybe didn't help with getting ready, and his reaction was harsh. She might also be upset because the clothes weren't dry, implying he might have been wrong about the drying time, leading to the delay. She could feel he's being overly strict with timeliness, not considering her needs.\n\nKey points to consider: Communication. The author mentioned the time they needed to leave, but did he check in with her as time approached? Did he offer help or support while she was getting ready? The fact that he raised his voice suggests emotional conflict, which can be a problem even if the underlying issue (lateness) is a concern. Also, leaving her alone when she's not ready could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, not dressed), which is probably unkind regardless of the reason.\n\nAnother angle: The author's actions led to him attending the wedding alone, which might have caused Jill to feel embarrassed or hurt. The argument over who's right might be more about communication styles and conflict resolution rather than just the act of leaving. The author might have a valid point about punctuality, but the way he handled the situation (yelling, leaving her alone) could be problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because he handled the situation poorly, maybe without considering Jill's feelings, and his reaction was disproportionate. If B (no), it's because he was trying to uphold a commitment and had valid reasons for his actions.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. Even if the author had a valid reason to be on time, the way he handled the frustration (raising his voice, leaving her in that state) is likely to be seen as harsh. The fact that this is a recurring issue (they \"have this convo a lot\") suggests that there might be a pattern of miscommunication. The author might think he's not in the wrong because he's focusing on the lateness, but others might see his actions as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is at least partially in the wrong. He could have handled the situation better by being more supportive, maybe helping Jill get ready instead of just waiting and then leaving. Yelling and leaving her alone when she's not ready seems unkind, even if the intention was to be on time. So the answer might be A (yes). However, some might argue that the author wasn't in the wrong because he was trying to be punctual, so it's a bit of a judgment call. But in terms of relationship dynamics and empathy, the author's actions probably contributed to the problem."
