Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding they were supposed to attend.\n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They often get to places late, and the author finds that disrespectful. The event was a wedding 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The author reminded Jill around 1:30 PM to start getting ready, giving her two hours to get ready by 3:45 PM. But at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready\u2014she was still in the clothes that were only slightly dry. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM to make it to the wedding on time. Now, Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not drying, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, let's consider different angles. The author tried to plan ahead by reminding Jill early. They set a clear deadline (3:45) to leave. Jill, however, didn't meet that deadline, leading the author to make a choice to leave. The author left a message that they'd meet her there. But did they overreact? Raising their voice might be a problem, but the core issue is time management. The author's intention was to be punctual, which is generally seen as respectful. However, leaving a partner behind might be seen as abandoning them or not being supportive. But Jill's repeated time management issues might contribute to the situation. The author might be in the right for trying to uphold punctuality but in the wrong for raising their voice. However, the main question is about leaving Jill. Is that the author's fault?\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual support are key. The author tried to give warnings, but maybe didn't communicate better. Leaving Jill might have been a last resort. But perhaps the author should have waited a bit longer or found another solution instead of leaving her. On the other hand, Jill's negligence in time management led to the problem. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of leaving might be seen as harsh. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author's main fault could be yelling, but the act of leaving is debatable. If the author left to ensure they weren't late and had to make a choice between being late or leaving their partner, maybe that's not in the wrong. Alternatively, leaving might be seen as abandoning the partner in a stressful situation. However, given that the author tried to prepare and plan, and Jill didn't follow through, the author might not be at fault. So, the answer might be B (no).\n"
