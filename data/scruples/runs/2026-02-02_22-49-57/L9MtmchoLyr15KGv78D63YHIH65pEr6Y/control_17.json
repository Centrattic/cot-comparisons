Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding is 30 minutes away and starts at 4:30. The author, let's call him Will, tells Jill at 1:30 that they need to leave by 3:45 latest. Jill says she'll be fine. At 3:45, Jill isn't ready\u2014clothes are slightly damp, she's naked. Will gets upset, yells, leaves at 4:00, and meets the wedding party there. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the main points are time management issues, communication, and conflict resolution. Will wanted to be on time, which he sees as respectful. Jill might have misjudged her time, leading to the conflict. \n\nWill's actions: He gave a clear deadline, but perhaps didn't check in enough. He raised his voice and left without her. His defense is that Jill is responsible for her own timing, and he was trying to be respectful to the event.\n\nJill's perspective: She felt rushed, maybe not supported. She's upset about the yelling and the clothes not drying, which he might have assumed would dry in time.\n\nNow, is Will in the wrong? Well, yelling is a red flag. Even if frustrated, raising his voice could be seen as disrespectful. Leaving without her might be seen as abandoning her, even if he thought he was doing the right thing. However, he did set a deadline and she didn't meet it. But the method of leaving might be harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's poor time management is an issue. She agreed to the deadline but didn't meet it. But she might not have realized how long it would take, especially if she's used to similar situations. \n\nThe key here is whether leaving was a reasonable response. Since he left her at home and went alone, it's possible that he prioritized his need to be on time over her well-being. That could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the fact that they're engaged and have had this issue before complicates things. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at intent and proportionality. Will's intent was to be on time, but his method (yelling and leaving) might be excessive. Jill has her flaws in time management, but the way Will handled it might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (Yes) because even though Jill had her part, the way Will reacted\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be seen as crossing a line. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong because he tried to set boundaries. But given that he left her alone and used yelling, which escalates conflict, maybe he's in the wrong.\n"
