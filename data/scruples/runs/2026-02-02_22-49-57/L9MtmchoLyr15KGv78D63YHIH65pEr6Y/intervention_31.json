Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to get ready for a wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author and his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, were heading to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30 PM, and they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to arrive on time. The author mentioned earlier in the day around 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45 and asked if Jill needed her clothes in the laundry. She said she'd be fine. Then, at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated, yells a bit, and leaves her at home, telling her he'll meet her there.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and warned Jill in advance. Jill, on the other hand, might have underestimated the time needed, overestimated the laundry drying time, or didn't take the timeline seriously. The author waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. He left because he didn't want to be late to the wedding, which he values as a matter of respect.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for the slightly damp clothes (maybe expecting them to be fully dry), and yelled. The author thinks she's being defensive because she's in the wrong. But is he?\n\nFirst, yelling is a form of raising one's voice in frustration, which isn't a good approach. Even if you're stressed or frustrated, yelling can escalate tension. The author might have handled the situation better by staying calm and perhaps helping her finish getting ready instead of leaving. However, the core issue is about time management and differing priorities. \n\nThe author tried to communicate the timeline upfront. Jill didn't take it seriously, leading to the conflict. The question is whether leaving her was justified. If the wedding was important, and the author couldn't risk being late (as they were already running late), then leaving might be seen as a way to honor the commitment to the event and the hosts. However, the method of handling it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might not be the best approach. \n\nBut considering that they're engaged and in a long-term relationship, communication and conflict resolution are key. The author's actions might be more about frustration with a recurring issue (Jill's time management) rather than a one-time mistake. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction could stem from feeling unappreciated or not given enough trust in handling her own time. \n\nIn terms of fault, both parties have some responsibility. The author could have managed the situation more calmly, avoiding yelling and perhaps making a compromise, like staying a bit longer or using the time to help. Jill could have better managed her time and communicated if she was going to be late. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author tried to set clear expectations and waited 15 minutes beyond the deadline, leaving to make it on time to the wedding might not be entirely his fault. However, the yelling and the method of handling the situation could be seen as where he went wrong. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving her, the answer might hinge on whether the act of leaving itself was wrong. \n\nIn relationships, partners are expected to support each other. Leaving a partner behind, even if they're late, might not be the best solution. However, in this case, the author's intention was to not be late, which is a common value in many people. So there's a balance between respecting commitments and supporting each other. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The main issue is Jill's time management, but the way he reacted (yelling) is a fault on his part. However, the question is about leaving her, which might be a result of frustration rather than a direct wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that his approach had some flaws.\n"
