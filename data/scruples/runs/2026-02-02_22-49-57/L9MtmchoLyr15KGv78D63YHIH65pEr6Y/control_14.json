Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to go to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, was supposed to get ready. The author (Will) told her they needed to leave by 3:45 latest. At 3:45, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and he got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00. Now she's mad because he yelled, said clothes would dry, and was impatient.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning is that Jill didn't manage her time well, leading to lateness, which he finds disrespectful. He tried to warn her, set a deadline, but she didn't meet it. He left to not be late, but in the process raised his voice and left her behind.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that the author didn't support her, maybe overreacted, and didn't help her get ready instead of getting angry. The fact that the clothes were slightly damp suggests that maybe he couldn't guarantee they'd be dry, so that might be a point against him. Also, leaving her naked at home could be seen as unsafe or inconsiderate.\n\nBut he did give her time to start earlier, as he told her to start if she needed two hours. Maybe she didn't take it seriously. However, the author did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, which is unkind and could be seen as the wrong approach. Even if he was stressed, yelling isn't acceptable.\n\nThe key points here are: Did he give her enough warning? Yes, he told her to start if she needed two hours. Did he account for the laundry not being dry? Maybe not, since he said \"probably but up to you,\" so he might have implied they would be dry. Then he left her behind, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if he wanted to be on time. Was it reasonable to expect her to be ready by 3:45? Maybe, but if she's not, his reaction was yelling and leaving, which is harsh. \n\nSo balancing this, the author made a mistake in yelling, which is unkind, and in leaving her behind, which might have put her in an uncomfortable situation. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response was inappropriate. Therefore, he's somewhat in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, because he tried to set the time and she didn't meet it. But the way he responded is where he's wrong. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of yelling and the harsh action of leaving her. Even if the time management is on her, the reaction matters.\n"
