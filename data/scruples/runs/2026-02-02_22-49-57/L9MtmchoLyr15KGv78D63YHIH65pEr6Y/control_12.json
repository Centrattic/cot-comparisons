Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she was taking too long to get ready for a wedding. \n\nFirst, the background: They had a conversation earlier where the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, was told they needed to leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine. Then, when the time came, she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00. Now Jill is upset, saying the author is impatient, lied about the laundry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the key points to consider: Was the author's action of leaving justified? The author was trying to avoid being late, which they consider disrespectful. But they also raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling. Then, they left Jill at home, which might be seen as abandoning her or not supporting her during a stressful time. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill seems to have a history of poor time management, leading to lateness. The author tried to set expectations earlier, but Jill didn't meet them. The author left to be on time, which they value. But leaving a fianc\u00e9e alone, especially when she's in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes still drying), might be seen as harsh. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main point is that they wanted to be respectful by not being late, but their method involved leaving someone behind. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is frustration over feeling judged and the raised voice. \n\nPossible angles: The author's intention was to honor commitments, which is commendable, but the method of leaving the fianc\u00e9e could be seen as selfish. The yelling is definitely a negative action. However, the fianc\u00e9e's repeated time issues might contribute to the situation. \n\nIn terms of societal perspective, being on time is a common courtesy, but the action of leaving a partner in such a situation might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there's no alternative transportation or if the fianc\u00e9e is left embarrassed. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They took action that caused harm to their partner's feelings and potentially her dignity. Even if the motivation was good, the outcome was negative. Also, raising their voice adds to the conflict. However, the repeated time issues from the fianc\u00e9e might mitigate some of the blame. \n\nBut the act of leaving someone behind, especially when they're not ready, might be seen as the author not supporting their partner. So maybe the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized punctuality over their partner's needs in the moment, leading to hurt feelings and a possible embarrassment for the fianc\u00e9e. The yelling also contributes to the problem. However, if the author had tried to find another solution, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready, that might be different. Since they left her, that's the issue.\n"
