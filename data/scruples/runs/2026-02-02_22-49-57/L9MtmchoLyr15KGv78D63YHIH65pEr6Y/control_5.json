Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late often. He wanted to be on time because he finds lateness disrespectful. They had agreed she should start her laundry early, but she didn't, and her clothes were only slightly dry by 3:45 PM. He waited until 4:00 PM, then left alone, which upset her.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to be responsible, planning ahead, and avoiding being late. He even gave her a heads-up about the time. However, he raised his voice and left her, which caused conflict. Jill might feel disrespected or abandoned, thinking he didn't support her or consider her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's behavior is problematic. She didn't follow through with the plan, leading to the situation. But the author's reaction of yelling and leaving might be seen as harsh, even if he had a valid reason. Communication is key here. Maybe he should have talked to her calmly instead of raising his voice and leaving. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, leaving her wasn't the best solution, but he was trying to adhere to their agreed time. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. People in relationships often need to prioritize each other's feelings, even when there's frustration. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made a mistake in his approach. He had a reason but could have handled it better. So, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction was inappropriate, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
