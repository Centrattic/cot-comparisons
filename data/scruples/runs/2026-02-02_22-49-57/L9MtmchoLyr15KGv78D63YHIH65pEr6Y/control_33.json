Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're at a wedding 30 minutes away starting at 4:30. They agreed to leave by 3:45. The author told Jill to start getting ready at 1:30 because they needed two hours. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are damp. The author gets frustrated, yells, and leaves at 4:00 to get there on time. Now, Jill is upset, saying he was mean and impatient.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is concerned about being on time, which they consider respectful. Jill, on the other hand, underestimated her time and didn't get ready on time. The author left, but did they do the right thing?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to be on time, which is important. They communicated the need to leave early, but Jill didn't follow through. The author raised their voice in frustration, which is a problem. Yelling is not great, but the main action here is leaving. Is that acceptable?\n\nOn the other hand, leaving a partner at home, even if they're late, could be seen as abandoning them. Weddings are important events, and leaving someone in an unflattering state (naked, clothes not dry) might be inconsiderate. The author might have handled it better by staying and helping or finding another solution, like arriving late together. But they prioritized punctuality over their partner's situation.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration led to yelling, which is a red flag in relationships. Even if Jill was to blame for not being ready, raising their voice is unkind. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their actions have valid criticisms. The question is whether their choice to leave was wrong. \n\nSome might argue that the author had a right to be on time and chose a practical solution. Others might say that instead of leaving, they should have addressed the situation together, like calling the wedding to let them know they'd be late. The author's decision to leave could be seen as selfish if it caused distress to Jill. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at communication and actions. The author did communicate the need to leave, but when things went wrong, their response was to leave and yell. That's where the conflict arises. So maybe the answer is that the author is somewhat in the wrong for the yelling and leaving, but there's nuance. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the author did leave and yelled, which are both problematic, the answer might be A (Yes). But the situation is a bit of a shared responsibility. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given the options, AITA often sides on the person being in the wrong if they made a harsh choice, even if the other person had faults. So maybe the answer is A, yes.\n"
