Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (let's call him Will) left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They agreed they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. But Jill wasn't ready by then, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will's perspective is that Jill often mismanages her time, leading them to be late. He values punctuality and finds it rude to be late. He gave her a heads-up to start getting ready two hours in advance. When she didn't meet the deadline, he decided to leave, not wanting to arrive during the ceremony. He feels she's defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nJill's side, as presented, is that she's upset because Will was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (even though they weren't), and yelled at her. She might feel that he was harsh and didn't consider her needs or the situation. The fact that the clothes were only slightly damp suggests maybe there was a misunderstanding about the drying time. Also, leaving her at home after yelling could be seen as abandoning her when she's already stressed and not ready.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points. Was Will justified in leaving? He wanted to be on time, which is reasonable. But leaving Jill alone when she's not presentable might be considerate. Also, raising his voice is a valid point\u2014yelling can be hurtful regardless of the situation. Did he handle it poorly? Maybe. Perhaps he could have tried to calm her down or communicated better instead of escalating the situation by yelling and leaving.\n\nAnother angle: Weddings are formal events where being late is indeed frowned upon. But so is being disrespectful to your fianc\u00e9e. The problem might stem from ongoing issues with time management and communication. Will's frustration with Jill's recurring lateness could be valid, but his reaction might have been too harsh. Leaving her at home when she's in that state could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he wanted to be punctual.\n\nAlso, the fact that he told her the clothes would be dry, but they weren't, might be a point of contention. Even if he thought they would be dry, if they weren't, that's a miscommunication. Jill might feel he set up expectations that he didn't meet, adding to her stress.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If Will has repeatedly expressed his issues with lateness, Jill might need to adjust, but Will's approach to handling it (yelling, leaving) isn't the most constructive. There's a balance between holding each other accountable and being supportive. Leaving her alone in a stressful situation might have been the wrong choice, even if the intention was to be on time.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his reaction, while possibly stemming from frustration, was harsh and could have been handled more compassionately. He could have tried to help her get ready instead of leaving her in an embarrassing situation.\n"
