Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because she wasn't ready on time. The situation is about a wedding they were supposed to attend. The author planned to leave by 3:45 to make it on time, but Jill wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management and they often end up late. He values punctuality and finds it disrespectful. On the other hand, Jill ended up not being ready, leading to the argument. The author left her, and now she's upset, feeling he was impatient, made a false promise about the laundry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45, and she said she'd be fine. But when she wasn't ready, he got frustrated. Raising his voice is a problem because it's about how he expressed his frustration. Leaving her might be a consequence of his impatience, but maybe there was a better way to handle it without yelling and leaving her alone.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did leave her, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was at fault. However, she had prior issues with time management, so maybe he had a reason to be strict. But the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014could be the issue. Maybe he should have found a compromise, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of just leaving. \n\nAlso, he mentioned that he told the clothes might not dry in time, implying he didn't guarantee they would. But Jill might have thought they would, leading to confusion. So, perhaps his communication wasn't perfect either. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. Jill didn't meet the deadline, but the author's reaction was harsh. The real question is whether he's in the wrong for his actions. Since he left her and used a harsh tone, even if she was at fault, his actions (yelling and leaving) could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of how he handled the situation, not necessarily the fact that he left her. Alternatively, if the situation was a recurring problem, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nBut in terms of immediate actions, yelling and leaving might be more his fault. So the answer is A.\n"
