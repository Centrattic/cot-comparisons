Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, there's a history of time management issues with Jill. The author mentions that she's not good at budgeting her time, leading to frequent lateness. The wedding is 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author told her they need to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author tried to communicate the need to leave on time. Jill didn't manage her time properly, leading to the delay. The author was stressed about being late, which is understandable. They raised their voice, which is a problem, but the main action was leaving her. \n\nIs it wrong to leave someone behind if they're not ready? Well, the author might argue they were trying to respect the event's schedule. But leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home might be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the author admitted to yelling, which adds to the issue. However, there's a pattern here\u2014Jill's repeated lateness, and the author's attempt to set a clear deadline. \n\nOn one hand, the author acted out of frustration from past experiences. On the other, leaving her might not be the best solution. Maybe there were alternatives, like giving her an extra few minutes beyond 3:45 but before 4:00. But since they left at 4:00, maybe that's the best they could do given the time constraint.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels the author was mean and made assumptions about the laundry. The author might have implied the clothes would dry, but Jill's clothes were only slightly damp, so maybe the author was wrong in thinking they'd dry. That's a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action of leaving could be seen as impulsive. Even with frustration, leaving someone might not be the right approach. The yelling also contributed to the conflict. However, the root cause is Jill's repeated lateness. The author tried to set clear expectations but didn't follow through effectively. Maybe they could have handled the frustration differently without resorting to leaving her behind.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author is at least partially at fault for their reaction and the decision to leave. But Jill's time management is also an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they left her and raised their voice, even if understandable, it's likely they are at fault here. So the answer might be A (yes).\n"
