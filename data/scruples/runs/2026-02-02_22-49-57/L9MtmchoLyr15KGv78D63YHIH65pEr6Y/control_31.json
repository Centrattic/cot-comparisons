Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the guy left his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. He wanted to make sure they're on time because he thinks being late is rude. She wasn't ready, her clothes were still wet, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, then left alone. She's upset because he was mean, didn't consider that the clothes might not dry in time even if he said they would, and now he's asking if he's the one in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's intention was to be on time and not disrupt the wedding. He warned her they needed to leave by 3:45, and she said she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he left. But he did raise his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is never good, especially in a relationship. It can be hurtful even if the situation is frustrating. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's trying to be responsible. He's trying to hold her accountable for her time management. But he left her behind. Is that fair? Leaving someone alone might be inconsiderate. She might have felt embarrassed or worried if she was not ready. Also, he said the clothes \"would be dry\" but they were slightly damp, so maybe he was wrong about that, adding to her stress.\n\nBut then again, she was the one who didn't manage her time properly despite the warnings. The problem might be that he didn't communicate better instead of just leaving. Maybe he could have given her a chance to finish, even if it meant they'd be a few minutes late. However, walking in while they're down the aisle is a common concern at weddings, so his timing might be tight.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He yelled, which is a red flag. Leaving her alone could be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, his reaction might be worse. Also, he told her the clothes would be dry, which they weren't, so maybe he's not entirely blameless there. She's defensive because she knows she was supposed to be ready on time. But he could have handled it differently without yelling and leaving. So maybe he's partially at fault. But is he the main one in the wrong? The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he raised his voice and left her, which could be seen as harsh, even if she was late, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But others might argue he was just trying to be responsible. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the yelling and leaving her alone are significant issues. So the answer is A.\n"
