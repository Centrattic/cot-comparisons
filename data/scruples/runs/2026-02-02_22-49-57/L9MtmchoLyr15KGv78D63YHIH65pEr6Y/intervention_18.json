Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding. The story says that they were supposed to leave by 3:45, but Jill wasn't ready by then. The author waited until 4:00 and left, which made Jill upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The wedding starts at 4:30, and the author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her. \n\nJill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not drying, and yelled. The author argues that Jill knew the time constraint and that they were trying to be punctual. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but wants opinions.\n\nI should think about both sides. On one hand, the author tried to communicate the time constraint early (at 1:30), gave warnings, and waited until 4:00. On the other hand, raising their voice might have been a mistake, and maybe there's a communication breakdown. But the author left to avoid being late, which could be seen as responsible. However, leaving a fianc\u00e9e might seem harsh. \n\nBut considering the context, the author tried to manage the time, Jill didn't follow the plan, and the author acted to meet the commitment. The key points are communication and whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author might not be in the wrong, but maybe there's room for understanding both perspectives. However, since the user is asking for A or B, and the initial thought is B, maybe stick with B. But some might argue A if the yelling and leaving without trying to help more is the issue. Hmm. But the main point is being late vs. being considerate. The author's action to avoid being late could be seen as justifiable. So perhaps B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
