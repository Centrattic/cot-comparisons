Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The story goes that the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management, and they often get into these situations. The author tried to set a time to leave, but Jill wasn't ready by the deadline. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was trying to be on time, which is respectful to the wedding guests. They gave a clear deadline and warned her beforehand. But they did raise their voice, which can be seen as losing their temper. Then they left her when she wasn't ready. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time well despite being warned. She might have known this was a problem before. However, the author left her in an awkward situation, which could be hurtful. Leaving a partner alone, even if they're late, might not be the best approach. It could come off as abandoning her or not supporting her.\n\nNow, thinking about communication. The author's frustration led to yelling, which isn't ideal. But in a situation where they both value punctuality, maybe the author felt they had no choice. However, leaving her might not have been necessary. Maybe they could have stayed and helped her get ready or waited a bit more. \n\nAlso, the author's main point is that they don't want to be late, which is understandable. But their reaction escalated the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels yelled at and left, which can damage trust and support in a relationship. \n\nSo, the author probably isn't entirely wrong because they were trying to respect the event's timing. But their method of handling it was flawed. They could have handled the frustration differently, maybe by staying and supporting Jill instead of leaving. The yelling and abrupt departure might make them at least partially responsible. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the situation is frustrating, the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh and not supportive. There might have been better solutions than abandoning her, even if they were late. The author's actions caused hurt feelings, which is a problem in a relationship. So, even if Jill was at fault for being late, the author's response wasn't the best, making them partially responsible.\n"
