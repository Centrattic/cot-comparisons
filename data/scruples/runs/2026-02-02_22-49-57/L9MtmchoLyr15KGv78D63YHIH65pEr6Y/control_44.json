Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the background: Jill isn't good at time management, leading to frequent lateness. They had a conversation early in the day about the laundry and the need to leave by 3:45. The author warned her to start early. When 3:45 comes, Jill is still not ready, clothes are damp, and he gets frustrated. He raises his voice and leaves at 4:00, causing her to be upset.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he was trying to avoid being late to the wedding, which he considers a matter of respect. He communicated the deadline and gave a heads up. His frustration led to yelling and leaving. He thinks Jill is being defensive.\n\nJill's perspective is that she was treated impatiently, the clothes weren't dry as he said, and he was mean. She might feel that he didn't support her or help her get ready. Also, he left her alone, which could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready), which is problematic.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author did set a clear deadline and gave a heads up. However, he raised his voice, which is a loss of temper. Leaving her when she's not ready\u2014especially in a state of being naked\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly unsafe. Even if Jill is responsible for time management, the author's reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh. He could have helped her get ready instead of abandoning her, even if she was at fault for not being prepared. The fact that he left her alone might cause emotional distress, even if it was to avoid being late.\n\nBut, it's also true that punctuality is important, and the author was trying to uphold that. However, the method he used was problematic. So, while Jill might share some responsibility for not managing her time, the author's actions (yelling and leaving her in that state) are likely the main issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
