Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves recurring issues with time management and communication.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, leading to frequent lateness. They had a discussion earlier about leaving by 3:45 PM, but Jill wasn't ready by then. The author waited until 4:00 PM and then left, which made Jill angry. She's upset about the yelling and not being ready on time.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author probably felt frustrated due to past instances of being late and wanted to be respectful to the wedding guests. On the other hand, Jill might feel disrespected for being left alone, especially after being told the clothes would be dry. \n\nThe key points are communication, past behavior, and the immediate action. The author gave a heads-up about the deadline, but Jill didn't follow through. The author's frustration led to raising their voice, which could be seen as harsh. However, the primary issue is whether leaving was justified. Since they were going to be late regardless, maybe the author made a call to honor their punctuality. But leaving Jill behind might be seen as abandoning her, even if she was at fault. \n\nUltimately, while Jill's time management is a problem, the author's method of handling it could be improved. However, the core question is about being wrong. If the author's actions were a one-time reaction to a recurring issue, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they overreacted, that's another angle. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations of responsibility in such situations.\n"
