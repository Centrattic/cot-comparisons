Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author explains that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management, and they often end up late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author warned her they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill said she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she wasn't, her clothes were still damp, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're at fault. The key points to consider are: communication, expectations, and the actions taken.\n\nThe author set a clear deadline (3:45) and reminded Jill to start early if she needed two hours. Jill assured them she'd be ready. However, she didn't follow through. The author left when it was clear she wasn't ready, which might be seen as leaving her in the lurch. But the author also raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling, adding to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, showing up late to a wedding is considered rude, and the author wanted to be punctual. They tried to manage time but failed due to Jill's inconsistency. However, leaving without her might not be the best solution. They could have tried to wait a bit longer, communicated better, or handled the frustration without raising their voice.\n\nJill's responsibility to manage her time is her issue, but the author's reaction (yelling and leaving) might have been excessive. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of handling it could be questioned.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be partially responsible for how they handled the situation, especially the yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill's safety. However, the root cause is Jill's repeated tardiness. The author tried to communicate, but when the situation escalated, their response might have been too harsh. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often criticize the person who leaves someone behind without considering the other's perspective. But here, the author's frustration is due to a recurring problem. However, the act of leaving could be seen as abandoning someone in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready), which is inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's main mistake might be in the yelling and leaving rather than the initial decision to leave. But since they left before the wedding started, maybe they were trying to be considerate of the event's timing. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be partly at fault for their reaction, but Jill's repeated behavior is the core issue. However, the act of leaving could be seen as the author's choice, so they might share responsibility. The answer could be A (Yes) because the author's actions (yelling and leaving) were unkind, even if Jill was at fault.\n"
