Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. They agreed to leave by 3:45 PM. The author reminded Jill at 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45, but Jill insisted she'd be ready. Then, when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still getting dressed. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding alone. Now Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe author argues that Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had a valid concern about being late, which is disrespectful. They set a clear deadline and warned Jill. However, leaving her at home when she wasn't ready might have been harsh. The key points are the communication, the frustration leading to yelling, and the decision to leave.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a responsibility to be on time and tried to plan accordingly. On the other hand, leaving without her even when she wasn't ready could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not fully dry). Also, raising their voice adds to the conflict.\n\nBut the author's intention was to make it to the wedding on time, which is understandable. Jill's poor time management is a recurring issue, as mentioned. The author might feel that they can't always wait for her to be ready. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might be where the fault lies. It's about balancing respect and responsibility.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if Jill was at fault for not managing her time, the author's response might have been too harsh. Leaving her alone when she wasn't prepared could be seen as neglecting her needs in that moment. The author should have tried to find a solution, like asking if there's anything they could do to speed up her process instead of just leaving.\n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the method of handling the situation may have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the approach was not considerate of Jill's state and the relationship dynamics. However, some might argue B because the author was trying to maintain punctuality. It's a tough call, but considering the emotional impact, A might be more accurate.\n"
