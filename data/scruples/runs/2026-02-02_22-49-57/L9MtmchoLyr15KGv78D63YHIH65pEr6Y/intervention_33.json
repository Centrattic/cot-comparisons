Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, let's call him Will, is asking if he was in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home when they were about to be late for a wedding. The situation is that they had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to get to the 4:30 PM wedding on time. Jill, however, wasn't ready until 4:00 PM, and Will left her to get there on time. He raised his voice in frustration, which is part of the conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Both partners should be on time for events they've committed to. Will mentioned that Jill often has issues with time management, which they've discussed before. He tried to set a clear deadline and gave her a heads-up to start early. But Jill didn't meet that deadline. \n\nWill's actions: He waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. He left to avoid being late. He did raise his voice, which is a point against him. However, his intention was to be punctual, which is a reasonable expectation. \n\nJill's perspective: She's upset because Will told her the clothes would be dry. Wait, earlier he said, \"Probably but up to you.\" So he wasn't 100% sure, but she assumed they would be. She might be holding him responsible for her being late because the clothes weren't dry. That's a bit of a problem because he already warned her to start early. If she didn't listen, she can't blame him entirely for the dryers not being done. \n\nBut the fact that he left her might be seen as abandonment, even if he was concerned about being late. However, considering they were going to a wedding, arriving on time is a social expectation. Will prioritized that, which is understandable. \n\nThe yelling is a negative point. Even if he was stressed, raising his voice is not ideal. But the main issue is whether he was wrong to leave her. If they were going together, leaving her might seem harsh, but if she was the one not meeting the agreed time, maybe it's her fault. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. Will tried to communicate clearly. Jill didn't follow through. Will's frustration led to yelling, but leaving her wasn't necessarily wrong if he wanted to be on time. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since Will did make an effort to set a time and gave her a heads-up, and she didn't meet it, he might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the yelling is a negative action. The key is whether leaving her was justified. If he left because he couldn't wait any longer and to be on time, it's understandable. But if he left without ensuring her safety or considering her feelings, maybe not. However, given the context, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
