Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down what happened.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management, which leads to them often being late. They value punctuality and find it rude to arrive late. For the wedding, they set a strict departure time of 3:45 to make it by 4:30. Jill agreed but wasn't ready by the deadline. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her at 4:00, telling her to meet them there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, didn't account for the clothes not being dry, and was mean for yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and the communication between them. The author set a clear deadline and gave Jill a heads-up two hours in advance. However, they didn't follow up again to check if she needed help or if the timeline was realistic. They might have assumed she could manage, but maybe they should have been more proactive in helping her meet the deadline. \n\nWhen the deadline came and Jill wasn't ready, the author's frustration led to yelling and leaving. Yelling in frustration is a negative reaction, even if it's out of stress. Leaving someone alone when they're not ready, especially in a stressful situation, could be seen as abandonment. However, the author's intention was to ensure they weren't late to the event, which they find important.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have misjudged the time required, perhaps underestimating how long things would take, especially with the laundry not drying as expected. But she did agree to the deadline. The author could have been more supportive rather than just getting angry. Maybe they could have adjusted the timeline or offered assistance earlier instead of waiting until 3:45.\n\nThere's a balance between holding to commitments and being understanding. The author's approach was strict but might not have been the kindest. Leaving someone in a state of being unready could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author's intention was to maintain punctuality.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might have failed to check in again closer to the deadline, assuming Jill had everything under control. Instead of raising their voice and leaving, they could have tried to help Jill finish getting ready or adjust their plan if necessary. The yelling adds emotional harm, making the situation worse.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to handle stress without blame. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it (yelling and leaving) might have been unhelpful. Jill's defensiveness could stem from feeling criticized, which is a common reaction in such scenarios.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions\u2014while motivated by a desire to be on time\u2014were reactive and perhaps lacked empathy. Leaving Jill when she wasn't ready, combined with yelling, might be seen as inconsiderate and a breach of support expected in a relationship. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for the conflict.\n"
