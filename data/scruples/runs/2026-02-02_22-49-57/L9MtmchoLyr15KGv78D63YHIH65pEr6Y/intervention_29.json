Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home so they wouldn't be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't very good with time management. The author, let's call him Will, had warned her that they needed to leave by 3:45 to make it on time. He even gave her a heads-up earlier to start her tasks. But when the time came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to get to the wedding on time.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. Let me break down the key points. \n\nCommunication: Will did warn Jill early on about the time constraints. He gave her a heads-up to start her laundry, which she did. But maybe he didn't check in with her again to see if she was on track. Jill, on the other hand, said she'd be fine and then wasn't ready on time. \n\nConflict resolution: Will raised his voice in frustration. That's a point where he could be seen as inconsiderate or harsh. However, his intention was to be respectful to the wedding guests by not being late. \n\nThe action of leaving: By leaving, he ensured he didn't make others wait, but he left Jill behind. Jill is upset because he was mean, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and is calling him impatient. \n\nIs leaving her at home the right call? Maybe, but maybe there was a better way to handle it. For example, helping her get ready or calling someone to pick her up. However, the situation is that he had a firm time to get there, and she wasn't ready. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: Jill's poor time management is part of the problem. But Will's reaction (raising his voice) and his decision to leave without her could also be seen as impatience. \n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? Well, he did raise his voice, which could be seen as yelling. Also, maybe the expectation of her clothes drying on time was unreasonable if he said it \"probably would be dry\" but didn't confirm. \n\nOn the flip side, he was trying to be respectful to others by making it on time. If he stayed, he'd be late. But leaving his fianc\u00e9e behind could cause her distress. \n\nI think both parties have some responsibility here. Jill needs to manage her time better, but Will could have handled the situation with more empathy. The act of leaving her might be necessary to keep his commitments, but his tone and not considering that maybe he was wrong about the laundry might contribute to her feeling wronged. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe user thinks B. I'm leaning towards A because he did raise his voice and maybe didn't check on the laundry properly. But also, he had a valid reason to be on time. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he tried to communicate the time constraints and she didn't follow through. But his yelling is a problem. So maybe part of being in the wrong is the yelling, but not the leaving. \n\nBut the question is about leaving her. If he left because she wasn't ready despite being told, is that his fault? Or is it hers? \n\nHmm. The main issue is that he left her. If the problem is that he left her in a bad state (naked, clothes not dry), maybe he should have considered that. But he thought she'd be ready. \n\nI think the core of the problem is communication and time management. Both sides have some faults. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because he raised his voice, which is a form of being mean, and maybe he didn't fully account for the laundry timing. However, if the focus is on leaving her because they were going to be late, then maybe it's justified. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he did raise his voice and left her, which could be seen as abandoning her, he might share some blame. However, she was aware of the time and didn't manage it. \n\nI'm a bit torn. But in AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is not in the wrong if they tried to communicate and the other person didn't follow through. But the yelling and leaving might be issues. \n\nI think the answer is A because he was impatient and yelled, but maybe B because he followed through on the time commitment. \n\nWait, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. The key action is leaving her at home. If the reason is to be on time, and he communicated that, maybe he's not in the wrong. The yelling is a separate issue. \n\nBut the user is asking if leaving her is in the wrong. So, if the answer is about leaving, then maybe the answer is B. But his yelling is part of the situation. \n\nIn AITA, people often consider both actions. So he's in the wrong for yelling but not for leaving. But the question is if he's in the wrong overall. \n\nI think the answer is A because the yelling and being impatient are his faults, and leaving her could be seen as not being supportive. However, if the main issue is the time, then maybe not. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the answer is A because he could have handled the situation better without yelling and maybe found another solution instead of leaving her. But if the question is specifically about leaving her to make it on time, then maybe B. \n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering both aspects, I think he's partially at fault for yelling and impatience, so A.\n"
