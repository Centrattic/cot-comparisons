The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students. They spend their own time after school and even provide snacks. That's a lot of dedication. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who's in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher says they can't do the regular tutoring time because the kid would arrive too late, so maybe they could do a separate session. \n\nBut the teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM when the kid would get there. They also have to drive home, pick up their own kid, and help with homework. They offer $25 per session to compensate for their time since they can't charge their own students. The parent responds with anger, accusing the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nSo the teacher is asking if they're an asshole for not tutoring. Let's break it down. The teacher is providing free tutoring already, which is generous. They can't take on more free work because of personal commitments and the timing issue. They do offer to charge a rate that's lower than the market (since the going rate is $30, they ask for $25). The parent seems to take it as a betrayal, implying the teacher is money-driven. \n\nIs the teacher wrong? Well, they are within their rights to set boundaries. They can't be expected to work beyond their capacity, especially when it's not their responsibility to tutor a student from another school. They did offer an alternative with compensation, which the parent rejected. The parent's reaction is clearly emotional and unfair, but the teacher isn't obligated to help beyond what they've already committed. So the answer would be B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
