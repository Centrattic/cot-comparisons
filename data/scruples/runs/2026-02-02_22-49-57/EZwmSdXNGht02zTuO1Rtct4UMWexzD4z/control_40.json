The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the teacher offers free tutoring after school for her own students, providing snacks and spending her own time. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who is in a different county and school. The teacher says she can't do the regular sessions because the timing doesn't work, but offers to do it separately for $25 per session. The parent gets really angry and calls her names, saying she's only in it for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already giving her time for free to her own students. She's in a low-economic area, so maybe the kids really need help. But the new request is for a student from another school, which adds more time and effort. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM, and driving home would take 40 minutes. She also has her own son to take care of. So she's asking for compensation because she's not getting paid for this extra work. \n\nIs it wrong to ask for money? The teacher's district probably doesn't allow charging students, but this is a different student from another school. So maybe there's no conflict of interest here. The parent is upset because they expected free help, but the teacher isn't obligated to help outside her job. The parent's reaction seems harsh, especially since the teacher is already volunteering her time for others. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher could have found another way to help without charging, but she's justified in wanting compensation for her time, especially since she's not being paid for it. The parent's accusations that she doesn't care about kids are baseless. So the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for payment for additional work outside her current commitments.\n"
