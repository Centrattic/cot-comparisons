The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is a first-grade teacher in a low-income area who offers free after-school tutoring. They were contacted by a parent from another school whose son is in a different county and school. The parent's friend's daughter is being tutored, so the parent approached the teacher for her son. The teacher offered to tutor but only if the child could make it by 2:50 PM. Since the other school dismisses 30 minutes later, the parent asked if the teacher could wait until 4:15 PM. The teacher, who has a long drive home and needs to help her own son with homework, offered to tutor for $25 per session. The parent reacted angrily, calling the teacher names and accusing her of being selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not agreeing to tutor the child for free. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students. She's making a personal sacrifice by funding snacks and spending her time after school. That's commendable. The parent from another school is asking for a similar service but the logistical issues are significant. The child is in a different county, school ends later, and the teacher's schedule is already tight. \n\nThe teacher proposed a fee because she can't do it for free anymore. The parent got upset, which is understandable if they can't afford it, but the teacher isn't obligated to provide free services beyond her own students. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when her own time and resources are already stretched thin. Plus, the parent's reaction is harsh and unfair, especially given the teacher's existing commitment. \n\nI think the key points here are the teacher's existing commitment, the logistical impossibility of the request, and the parent's unrealistic expectation of free services. The teacher isn't being selfish; she's being realistic about her capacity and time. So the answer should be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
