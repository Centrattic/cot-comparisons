The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring sessions after school for their own students. They even provide snacks and do this without payment. That seems really generous. Now, a parent from another school contacts the teacher, asking if they can tutor her son. The teacher is initially willing but finds out the child is from a different county and school that ends later, making it impossible to fit into the existing schedule. The teacher offers to tutor separately, but by the time the child could arrive (4:15 PM), the teacher is too tired after working from 6:30 AM and has other commitments like helping their own son with homework and a 40-minute drive home. So, the teacher sets a fee of $25 per session, which is lower than the local rate. The parent reacts negatively, accusing the teacher of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nNow, the teacher is questioning if they're an asshole for not helping. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the teacher's boundaries and the parent's expectations. The teacher is already giving their time and resources for free to their own students. The parent is asking for a favor beyond that, but the teacher has valid reasons for not being able to commit further without compensation. The teacher isn't obligated to offer free tutoring to non-students, especially when it affects their personal time and energy. The parent's reaction seems unreasonable because the teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries. The teacher's main job is to their own students, and they can't be expected to cover all external requests without some form of compensation, especially when it's outside their usual working hours. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
