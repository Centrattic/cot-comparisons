The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring after school for her own students. She's taking her own time and money to provide snacks. Then, a parent from another school contacts her because her friend's child is being tutored and they want the same for their son. The student is in a different county, so there's a timing issue. The parent asks if she can tutor the child separately later in the evening. The teacher says she's too tired by then and has her own child's homework to help with. She offers to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nThe teacher is in a rural, low-income area, which probably means resources are tight. She's already giving her time and resources without getting paid. The parent seems to expect the same free help even though the student isn't hers and has logistical issues. The teacher is within her rights to set boundaries and ask for compensation, especially since she's already overextending herself. The parent's reaction seems unfair because they accused her of not caring and being selfish, which doesn't make sense given the teacher's existing efforts. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for not helping and charging for her time. Answer B.\n"
