The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher offers free tutoring for her own students, which she organizes after school. She provides snacks and does this on her own time. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son, who is at a different school and can't make the scheduled times. The teacher is willing to adjust but asks for $25 per session, which is below the local going rate of $30. The parent gets angry and accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing unpaid tutoring for her own students, which is generous. She's not required to tutor others outside of her school. The parent is asking for a significant time commitment\u2014after the teacher's usual sessions, which end at 2:50 PM. The teacher would have to stay until 4:15 PM for this new student, but by then she's exhausted and has her own son to take care of. She sets a reasonable rate, lower than market, to cover her time. The parent's reaction is hostile and unfair, attacking her character and motives.\n\nThe key points here are that the teacher isn't obligated to help outside her job. She's already providing free services for her own students. The parent's request is outside the scope of her existing commitments, and she's within her rights to ask for compensation for her time. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding or not appreciating the teacher's existing workload and personal time. The teacher didn't do anything wrong; she set boundaries and communicated them clearly. The parent's reaction is the issue here. So, the answer is B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
