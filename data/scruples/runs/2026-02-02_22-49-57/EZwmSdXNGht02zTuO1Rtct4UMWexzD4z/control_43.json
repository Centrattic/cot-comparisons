The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school by tutoring them, especially after the parent reacted negatively when the teacher asked for payment.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for her own students, which is generous considering her school's policy against charging students. She provides snacks and spends her own time after school. That shows she's willing to help those in need without expecting anything in return.\n\nThen, the parent from another school asks for tutoring. The teacher agrees on the condition that the child can attend the existing sessions. However, the child's school schedule doesn't align, so the parent wants a separate session. The teacher offers to do that but asks for $25 per session, which is below the local market rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about kids.\n\nThe key points here are: the teacher was already giving her time for free, the parent is asking for a special arrangement that the teacher can't manage without compensation due to her own schedule and responsibilities. The teacher isn't obligated to help students from another school, especially when it adds significant personal burden. Asking for payment in this case is reasonable because she's using her own time beyond her job. The parent's reaction seems excessive and disrespectful, especially since the teacher was offering to help out of goodwill but couldn't meet the parent's expectations without compensation.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong because she set boundaries and asked for fair payment for her time, which is understandable. The parent's outburst is inappropriate, and the teacher wasn't obligated to help in the first place. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
