The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a first-grade teacher who volunteers to tutor students after school for free. The tutoring is in the afternoon, right after school ends at 2:40. They start at 2:50 and the teacher provides snacks, which they pay for themselves. Then a parent from another school contacts them about tutoring her son, but he's in a different county and school ends later. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but sets a fee of $25 per session because they can't stay after school due to their own son's homework and being too tired. The parent gets really upset, calls the teacher names, accuses them of being selfish and only in it for money.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down. First, the teacher is already giving their time and resources for free to their own students. They can't tutor another student from a different school after 2:50 because they have to go home and help their son. The teacher isn't at fault for not having the time or energy beyond their own commitments. Then they set a fee, which is lower than the market rate ($30 vs. $25), and the parent is mad about the cost. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher is trying to help but can't adjust their schedule beyond their own limits. Charging a fee is reasonable since the teacher is not getting paid by the district for this extra time. The parent might not realize the personal cost involved. Also, the teacher's own students are in their school, so they have a responsibility to them and their own family. The parent from another school is asking for something that's not feasible. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their job scope, especially when it's a different school district. They're already volunteering time and money for their own students. The parent's accusations of being selfish and uncaring don't hold because the teacher is helping others for free but can't extend that to someone else's child who isn't under their direct responsibility. The teacher's decision to charge a fee is a way to cover their own time and energy, which is fair. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
