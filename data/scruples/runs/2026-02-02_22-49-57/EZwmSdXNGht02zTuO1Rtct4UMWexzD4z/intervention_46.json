The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school to her own students, and she's doing this in a rural, low-income area. She pays for snacks herself and dedicates her time. That shows she's already going above and beyond. \n\nThen, a parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son. The child is in a different county with a later dismissal time. The teacher offers to tutor him but only if he can come on time. The parent's son can't make it because of the school schedule, so she suggests tutoring him separately. The teacher is willing to do that but asks for $25 per session because she's already spending her time and energy on her own students and has her own responsibilities. \n\nThe parent gets angry and attacks the teacher's character. The teacher is upset and questioning if she did the right thing.\n\nLegally, the teacher's district probably doesn't allow her to charge students for tutoring, especially those from another school. It's a conflict of interest, as mentioned. But since the parent is from another school, maybe the policies are different. However, the teacher is already doing free tutoring for her own students, and she's exhausted. She can't take on more without compensation because her time is limited. \n\nThe parent's reaction is clearly unfair. The teacher is in a tough spot, trying to help but also needing to manage her own resources. She isn't obligated to help someone outside her school, especially when it would take a toll on her personal time and energy. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She tried to accommodate but had valid reasons for needing compensation. The parent's anger was misplaced. Answer B.\n"
