The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for her own students. She's doing this for kids in need, providing snacks herself, and it's part of her job but within the limits of her district's policies. Now, a parent from another school contacts her about tutoring their child. The problem is that this child is in a different county and school, which dismisses later. The parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule to accommodate this kid.\n\nThe teacher says she can't do that because by the time the other school lets out, she's already exhausted and needs to get home. She offers to tutor for pay, $25 per session, but the parent reacts negatively, calling her names and accusing her of not caring. The teacher is now doubting herself.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is it reasonable for the teacher to ask for compensation when she's already providing free tutoring? Is she within her rights to say no because of the logistical issues? The parent's child is in a different district, so maybe the teacher isn't obligated to help. Also, the teacher is already taking on extra work without pay, which might be why she's stretched thin. The parent's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make the teacher right or wrong.\n\nThe teacher's job is to her own students. She's already doing extra by offering free tutoring. Helping another district's student would add more time and effort, which she's not required to do. Charging for that time is understandable since she's giving up her personal time. The parent's anger seems misplaced, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So, the answer is probably B (No, she's not the asshole). The teacher isn't obligated to help beyond her own responsibilities, and asking for compensation for her time is reasonable.\n"
