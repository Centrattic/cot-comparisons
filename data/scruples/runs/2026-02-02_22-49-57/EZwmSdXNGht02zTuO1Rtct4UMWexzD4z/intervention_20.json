The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The teacher is asking if they're the asshole for not helping another student from a different school. So, the situation is that they already tutor their own students for free after school, providing snacks and doing it all themselves. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son too, but he's in a different county and school. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets really angry and calls them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's circumstances. They're already doing free tutoring for their own students, which is commendable. They're in a low-economic area, so the parent might be struggling financially, but the teacher is also giving up their own time. The teacher works until 2:40, starts tutoring at 2:50, which is right after school. If they tutor another student later, the timing is an issue because they have their own son's homework to help with and the drive home. So the teacher's energy and time are limited.\n\nThe parent's request is for a student in a different school, which might not even be under the teacher's school district. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor that student. They tried to accommodate by offering a later session but needed compensation because it's outside their normal schedule and personal time. The parent then accuses the teacher of not caring about kids and being greedy. \n\nThe key points here are the teacher's right to set boundaries, the fact that they already do a lot for free, the logistical challenges, and the parent's inappropriate reaction. The teacher isn't required to tutor another student's child, especially outside their school. Charging a fair rate for personal time is reasonable. The parent's hostile response seems unwarranted. So the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They did offer help but had valid reasons for not proceeding. The parent's accusation of selfishness doesn't hold up considering the teacher's existing commitments and the parent's own circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
