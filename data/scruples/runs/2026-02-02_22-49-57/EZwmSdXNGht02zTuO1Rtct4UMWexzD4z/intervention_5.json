The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring to their own students after school, providing snacks and using their own time. Then a parent from another school asked if they could tutor their son, who's in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher said they'd tutor separately but wanted $25 per session. The parent got angry.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for their own students, doing free sessions and covering snacks. They're in a low-economic area, so maybe the parents can't afford $25. But the teacher can't charge their own students, and this is a different student. The parent might have expected the same free service because the teacher does it for their own kids. The teacher is overworked, has their own son to take care of, and driving home takes time. \n\nBut the parent's reaction seems harsh. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor students outside their school or district. They even offered to adjust the schedule if possible, but the timing just doesn't work. The parent's anger about money and accusing the teacher of not caring might be valid if the teacher had prior commitments, but in this case, the teacher is trying to help and is willing to provide a service for a fee. \n\nThe key points are the teacher's existing workload, the policy against charging their own students, and the parent's unrealistic expectations. The teacher isn't being selfish; they're setting boundaries. The parent's response is more about their own frustration with the cost or the situation. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided the service for their own students for free and set reasonable terms for helping another student. The parent's reaction is over the top, and the teacher is within their rights to say no or charge for their time.\n"
