The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the teacher is the asshole (AITA) for not helping another student from a different school.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring sessions to their own students. They work in a low-economic area, so they're doing this without charging and even providing snacks. That's pretty generous. The parent of another student, whose child is in a different school, approached them. The teacher agreed to help but then realized the logistical issues: the other school ends later, so the kid can't make it in time. Plus, the teacher is already exhausted after a long day, has to help their own son, and the drive home takes 40 minutes. \n\nThe parent wanted the teacher to adjust their schedule, which would require the teacher to stay way later. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, which is actually below the local rate of $30. The parent got angry and accused the teacher of not caring about kids and being selfish. The teacher feels wronged because they were just trying to help but couldn't adjust their schedule and wanted some compensation for their time.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher is already volunteering their time, the request is for a student outside their school, the logistical challenges make it hard, and the teacher is offering fair pay. The parent's reaction seems harsh and unfair given the circumstances. The teacher isn't obligated to help a student from another school, especially with the added time and effort. The teacher did offer an alternative with compensation, which is reasonable, especially since they\u2019re not getting paid for this extra work. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The parent's accusations don't hold up because the teacher tried to accommodate but had valid reasons for not being able to. The answer should be B.\n"
