The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is tutoring students after school for free because they can't charge due to conflict of interest. They're already doing this for their own students, providing snacks, and spending their time. Then a parent from another school asks for tutoring for her son, but he's in a different county and can't make the existing session time. The teacher offers to do it for $25 instead, and the parent gets angry, calling them names.\n\nSo the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Well, first, the teacher is already overextending themselves by offering free tutoring. They can't charge their own students, which is a district rule, so when someone else comes in asking for a different arrangement, the teacher is trying to balance their own time and energy. The parent's son is in another school, so it's not part of the teacher's current responsibility. The teacher is within their rights to set boundaries, especially since they can't take time off after the existing session because they're already exhausted and need to help their own kid.\n\nThe parent's reaction is pretty harsh. She accused the teacher of not caring and being selfish, which is unfair because the teacher is already giving their time for free. The teacher is asking for compensation here because it's an extra, separate session. Since the district doesn't allow charging their own students, but this is a different student, maybe the teacher is allowed to charge. But even if not, the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school or job duties. The parent's demands are unreasonable, expecting the teacher to adjust their schedule and time without compensation after they've already made personal sacrifices.\n\nSo the teacher isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries, which is necessary for their own well-being. The parent was ungrateful and abusive. Answer B.\n"
