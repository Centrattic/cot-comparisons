The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring after school for her students. A parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son, but he's in a different county and arrives too late. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but sets a fee of $25 per session, which the parent gets upset about, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to check the facts. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students, which she can't charge for because it's a conflict of interest in her district. She's doing this out of her own pocket, providing snacks, etc. So she's already going above and beyond for her students. \n\nNow, the parent in question is asking for tutoring for a student she's not even the teacher of\u2014another school, another county. The teacher's school ends at 2:40, her tutoring starts at 2:50. The other student's school ends later, so he can't come to the existing sessions. The teacher offers to make a separate session, but that would mean the kid arrives at 4:15 PM. The teacher gets to work at 6:30 AM, so by 4:15 PM, she's probably exhausted after a full day of teaching. Also, she has to drive home, take her own son for homework, which is a hassle. \n\nWhen she asks for $25 per session (which is under the local going rate of $30/hour), the parent reacts negatively. The parent accuses her of not caring about kids and being in it for money. The teacher is questioning if she's in the wrong for not helping for free.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? Well, she's already giving her time for free to her own students. She's not obligated to help another student from a different school. Charging for that time outside her current commitments isn't unethical, especially since she can't do it for free in her own district. The parent is upset because they expected free help, maybe without considering the teacher's time and energy. The teacher isn't being selfish if she's already working for free. She's setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The parent's reaction is unfair because they're attacking her character without justification. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher could have tried to find another solution, but she did offer to tutor the student if he could come on time, which he couldn't. The separate session timing is an issue because of her own family commitments. Charging for her time is justifiable here. So the teacher isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
