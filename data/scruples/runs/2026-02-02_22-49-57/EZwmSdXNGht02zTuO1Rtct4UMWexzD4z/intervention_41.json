The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher offers free tutoring to their own students after school, providing snacks and spending their own time. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son, who is in a different district and doesn't fit the existing schedule. The teacher offers to tutor the child at a later time but wants to be paid because they can't manage the extra time without compensation. The parent gets angry and accuses the teacher of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for free. They're in a low-income area, so they're giving up their time and money for snacks. The parent is asking for something that's not feasible logistically\u2014since the kid is in another district and doesn't arrive until later. The teacher is tired by 4:15 PM after a long day and has their own family responsibilities. \n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong because they were already providing a service for free. When the parent's request causes a conflict with their schedule and energy, it's reasonable to ask for compensation. The parent's reaction is harsh and inappropriate, especially since the teacher is trying to help but can't do it without adjusting their own time, which they value. Public service doesn't mean you have to give up all your personal time for nothing. The teacher's decision to charge is fair, and the parent's accusations are unfounded. So, the answer should be B.\n"
