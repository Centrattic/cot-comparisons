The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring after school for her students. One parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who is in a different county and school. The teacher agrees to do it for a fee because it's outside her normal tutoring schedule and she's already exhausted by 4:15 PM. The parent gets angry and accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the teacher's actions. She provides free tutoring for her own students, which is commendable. She uses her own time and money for snacks. When asked to tutor a student from another school, she's faced with logistical challenges: the student can't arrive on time, and she can't stay later because she's tired and needs to help her own son. She offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local market rate. The parent reacts negatively, leading the teacher to question if she did the right thing.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, she's already giving her time for free for her students. The parent's son isn't her student, so there's no obligation. The teacher is within her rights to set boundaries. The parent's accusations are harsh, but the teacher isn't obligated to help someone outside her school. Plus, she's considering her own time and energy, which is reasonable. Charging a fee for external tutoring isn't unethical here since her school prohibits charging students, but this is a different case. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but the teacher isn't the asshole for saying no. She's managing her own resources and time, which is understandable. So, the answer should be B, No.\n"
