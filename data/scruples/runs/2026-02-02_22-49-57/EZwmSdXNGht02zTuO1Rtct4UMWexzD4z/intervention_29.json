The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is offering free tutoring after school for her own students because they're from a low-income area. She provides snacks and does this for free. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who is in a different county and school. The teacher agrees to do it if they can get there on time, but the kid can't because their school ends later. The parent then asks if she can tutor the kid separately. The teacher is already tired by 4:15 PM, has to help her own kid with homework, and would have to drive home. She offers to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring.\n\nHmm. The teacher is already going above and beyond by offering free tutoring. She's not obligated to help other students outside her own school. Plus, she's taking time after work hours, which she's already using for her own students. When the parent from another school asks for help, it's a different school district and county. The teacher is probably not required to help them. She's also being honest about her availability and time constraints. She even offers to do it for $25, which is less than the market rate, showing she's willing to help but also needs compensation for her time. The parent's reaction is hostile and unfair. The teacher isn't in the wrong here because she's not obligated to help and she's being reasonable. So answer B.\n"
