The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for her own students, which she does at her own expense, including snacks and time. That's pretty generous. She's in a rural, low-income area, so resources might be tight.\n\nThen a parent from another school contacts her because her friend's daughter is being tutored. The parent wants her son, from a different county and school, to get help too. The teacher agrees to help if the kid can make it. But the kid's school ends later, so he can't come at the usual time. The parent then asks if she can tutor him separately, arriving at 4:15. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, has her own family responsibilities, and driving home takes time. So she offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local rate. \n\nThe parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of not caring. The teacher is upset, thinking she's not an asshole for asking for compensation. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not tutoring the other student.\n\nSo, the key points: The teacher is already giving her time for free to her own students. She's not obligated to help another school's student, especially when it's outside her schedule and would require her to stay late. She's offering compensation for her time, which seems fair because she's not getting paid for this. The parent expected free help, maybe assuming the teacher should do it as a favor. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Probably not. She's within her rights to set boundaries, charge for her time, and prioritize her own capacity. The parent was unreasonable in their expectations and reactions. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her responsibilities. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
