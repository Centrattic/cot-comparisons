The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to their own students, which is already a big commitment. They go out of their way to help, even providing snacks and doing this after a long day. Then a parent from another school asks for tutoring for her son, who's in a different county and school. The timing is an issue because the other school lets out later, so the kid would arrive too late for the existing sessions.\n\nThe teacher offers to adjust, but then realizes that would mean staying until 4:15 PM, which is after they've already been working since 6:30 AM. They also need to drive home, pick up their own son, and help with his homework. The parent then asks if the teacher would charge $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The key points here are the teacher's existing workload, their offer to tutor despite the challenges, and the parent's unreasonable expectations. The teacher is already providing a service for free for their own students. The parent's son is in a different school district, which complicates the arrangement. The teacher is setting boundaries regarding their time and energy, especially since they're already overextending themselves. Charging a lower rate is a reasonable request for compensation, given the time and effort required. The parent's reaction is hostile and dismissive of the teacher's situation. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They're maintaining professional boundaries and prioritizing their own needs, which is necessary for sustainability. The answer should be B.\n"
