The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. She offers free tutoring to her students after school as part of her job, but when a parent from another school asks her to tutor their child, she sets boundaries. The child is in a different county, so getting there would be a problem. The parent wanted her to wait for the child until 4:15, but the teacher says she's too tired by then and can't do it. She offers to tutor for $25 per session, and the parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the teacher did anything wrong. She's already providing free tutoring for her own students. The parent is asking for an additional service for a student not in her school. The teacher can't just leave her job to accommodate a student from another school. Also, the timing doesn't work because the other school ends later, making it impossible for the child to join on time. The teacher is being realistic about her time and energy, especially after a long day. She's also a parent herself, needing to pick up her son and help with his homework. \n\nThe parent's request is outside the scope of her current responsibilities. The teacher isn't required to tutor students from another school, even if it's a personal connection. Offering to do it for a fee is reasonable since it's outside her job. The parent's reaction seems harsh. They might not understand the teacher's limitations or the district's policies. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for her time. The parent's outburst is unprofessional and unfair. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
