The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is tutoring her own students for free, right? She already has a schedule set up after school, and she's paying for snacks. Then a parent from another school asks her to tutor her son, who's in a different county and can't make the existing time.\n\nSo the parent wants a separate session. The teacher says she'd have to charge $25 because she can't do it for free. The parent gets really upset, calls her names, accuses her of not caring. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for free. Charging for extra time seems reasonable. She's working late, has her own kid to deal with, and driving home takes time. She's not obligated to help outside her job. The parent's reaction is pretty harsh, especially considering the teacher isn't required to tutor another student from a different district. The teacher's offer was conditional on the parent getting the child there on time. Since the parent couldn't meet that, it's not her fault the schedule doesn't work. Also, the parent's son isn't her student, so she's under no obligation. Charging a fair rate is just asking to be compensated for her time. The parent's anger seems unwarranted. So the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
