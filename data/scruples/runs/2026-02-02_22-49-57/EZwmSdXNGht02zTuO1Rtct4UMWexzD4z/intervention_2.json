The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to their own students after school. They can't charge because of conflict of interest policies. A parent from another school asks for help, but the child is from a different county and school. The teacher suggests charging $25 per session since they can't fit the kid into their existing free schedule. The parent gets angry, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being in it for money.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher is already providing free tutoring to their own students, which is commendable. The parent's request is for a student they don't even teach, from another school district. The teacher can't just take that student into their current schedule because of time conflicts. They tried to offer an alternative by charging, which is understandable because their time is valuable, especially when it's after their own work hours and before getting home to help their own son. \n\nBut the parent got upset about the cost, even though the teacher is offering their time and not the usual rate. The teacher's asking price is lower than the market rate. It seems like the parent is being unreasonable, expecting free help outside of the teacher's school obligations. The teacher isn't obligated to help students from another district, especially when it's a personal arrangement. \n\nThe key points are: the teacher is doing a good thing by tutoring their own students for free. The parent's request is beyond the teacher's responsibility. The teacher is appropriately setting boundaries by asking for compensation for their time when possible. The parent's reaction is aggressive and unwarranted. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
