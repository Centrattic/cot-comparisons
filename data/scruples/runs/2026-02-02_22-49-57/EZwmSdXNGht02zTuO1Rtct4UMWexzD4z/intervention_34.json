The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to her own students, which is already a generous gesture, especially in a low-income area. She's even providing snacks out of her own pocket. Then a parent from another school approaches her asking for tutoring for her son, who is in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school ends later, so the child can't make it to the existing sessions. The teacher suggests charging $25 per session for the extra time, which the parent takes very badly, calling her names and accusing her of not caring.\n\nSo the main points here: the teacher is not obligated to tutor students outside her own school or district. She's already going above and beyond for her own students without any compensation. The parent's request is a bit of a stretch since the child isn't even in her school, and the logistical issues (timing, distance) make it hard. The teacher is also dealing with her own son's homework and commute. When she does offer to help, but asks for fair pay (which is lower than the market rate), the parent reacts aggressively. \n\nThe key here is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Since she's not required to tutor anyone, and the parent is making an unreasonable request beyond her current commitments, it seems like she's justified in saying no or asking for compensation. The parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate, but the question is about the teacher's actions. She's not an asshole for setting boundaries or asking for payment for her time, especially when she's already volunteering for her own students. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
