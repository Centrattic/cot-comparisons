The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring to her own students, providing snacks and taking time after school. That's a lot of personal investment. Then, a parent from another school asks for tutoring for her son. The problem is the timing: the student's school ends 30 minutes later, so he can't make the original 2:50 session. The mom wants a separate session.\n\nThe teacher says she's exhausted by 4:15 PM, needs to drive home, and has her own kid's homework to help with. She offers to charge $25 per session instead of doing it for free. The mom gets angry, calling her names and implying she's selfish.\n\nSo, the key points are: the teacher is already giving her time and resources for her own students without pay. The new request would require her to work much later, which is unreasonable. Charging $25 is a way to set boundaries. The mom's reaction seems harsh and unfair, especially since the teacher isn't obligated to help outside her school or for free. The teacher isn't in the wrong because she's maintaining her limits and considering her own well-being. The mom, on the other hand, is expecting free services beyond what's feasible. So the answer should be B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
