The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is tutoring students for free after school, providing snacks themselves. The parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son, but he's in a different county and school with a later dismissal. The teacher says if the kid can come on time, they'll help. The parent then asks to adjust the tutoring time to accommodate the kid's schedule, but that would mean the teacher has to stay later, which they're not up for. So they offer to pay $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calling them names and accusing them of caring only about money.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's situation. They're already doing this for free, which is a big commitment. The request from the parent is for a student outside their school and district, adding extra work and time. The teacher sets a boundary by asking for compensation, which is reasonable given their time and effort. The parent's reaction is over the top and disrespectful. \n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to help a student from another school, especially with logistical issues. They made it clear about the timing initially. The parent's son can't make it under the original schedule, so the teacher isn't at fault for not adjusting their schedule. Charging for that extra time is fair since it's outside their regular commitments. The parent's attack is unwarranted. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here.\n"
