The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The author is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They tutor their own students for free, providing snacks and taking time after school. Then a parent from another school contacted them, asking to tutor her son as well, who is in a different county and leaves school later. The author offered to tutor him separately but at $25 per session because they can't do it for free due to time and energy constraints. The parent got angry and made hurtful comments.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is already giving their time and resources to help their own students without pay. They have a policy of offering free tutoring, but when someone outside their school asks for the same, they set a boundary and asked for compensation. The parent is upset because the author is charging, implying they don't care about the kid. But the author is in a position where they can't extend their free help beyond their own students due to personal and professional limitations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the original offer was for their own students. The parent is asking for help with a different school's student, which the author isn't obligated to provide. Also, the author is in a low-income area and can't charge their own students, but for someone else, they can set a reasonable rate. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the author is setting boundaries and the situation is logistically impossible without compensation. The author isn't refusing to help the child out of malice; they're prioritizing their own students and personal time. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a reasonable request for compensation when their existing free service wasn't feasible for another student. The parent's anger is misplaced given the circumstances.\n"
