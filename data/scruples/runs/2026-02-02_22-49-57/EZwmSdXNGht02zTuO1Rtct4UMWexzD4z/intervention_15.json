The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details properly.\n\nThe teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students. They provide snacks and do this without pay because their district doesn't allow charging for tutoring. A parent from another school contacts the teacher, asking if they can tutor her son, even though he goes to a different school in another county. The teacher agrees to consider it but then realizes the timing is impossible because the other school ends later. The parent then asks if the teacher can wait for the child to arrive at 4:15 PM. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, needs to drive home, and has to help their own son with homework. The teacher offers to tutor for $25 per session, which is less than the market rate. The parent gets angry, accuses the teacher of not caring and being selfish. The teacher is questioning if they're an asshole for not tutoring.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, the other student is from a different school, the timing is logistically difficult, the teacher offers a lower rate than market, and the parent reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, the teacher isn't obligated to tutor students outside their own school. They have their own responsibilities and limits on their time and energy. The parent approached without considering the teacher's existing commitments. The teacher tried to be accommodating but found it impossible due to time constraints. Offering a lower rate than market price shows they still wanted to help but couldn't do it for free. The parent's reaction is aggressive and unfair, attacking the teacher's character.\n\nThe teacher is in a low-economic area, so maybe the parent is also in a tough spot, but the teacher isn't responsible for every child in the county. They've already given their time and resources to their own students. The parent's demand is unreasonable, expecting free or discounted service without considering the teacher's personal time and the logistical issues. The teacher is not in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for their time, which is reasonable when providing a service beyond their job responsibilities.\n"
