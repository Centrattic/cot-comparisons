The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher who started tutoring a student for free and then refused to do the same for another student from a different school is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for their own students. They provide snacks and spend their own time. When a parent from another school asks for the same service, the teacher explains the logistical issues: the other school's dismissal time is too late, and they can't accommodate that. The parent then suggests tutoring separately, but the teacher is exhausted by 4:15 PM and has other responsibilities.\n\nThe teacher asks for $25 per session, which is below the local rate of $30. The parent reacts negatively, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being selfish. The teacher is left wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the context: the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students. They can't take on more time without compensation. The other child isn't even their student, so there's no obligation. The parent's expectation to get free help from someone who already does so for their own students might be unreasonable. The teacher is within their rights to set boundaries and ask for payment if they choose to help. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but the teacher isn't wrong for not helping without payment. The answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
