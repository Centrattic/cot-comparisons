The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, which they fund themselves, including snacks. That shows they're already giving a lot of their time and resources. \n\nThe parent from another school asked if the teacher could tutor her son, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher initially agreed but realized the logistical issues: the child would arrive too late, and the teacher is already exhausted by 4:15. Plus, the teacher has her own son to take care of after work. \n\nShe offered to tutor but at a rate of $25, which is under the local going rate. The parent reacted angrily, calling her names and accusing her of not caring. The teacher is now questioning if she was wrong for not providing free tutoring.\n\nSo, the key points: Is the teacher obligated to tutor outside her school? She's already giving free tutoring, which is commendable. The parent's son is in another school district, so the teacher isn't responsible for him. The teacher's time and energy are limited, especially after a long day. Charging for the extra time seems reasonable, especially since the district doesn't allow charging students. The parent's reaction seems unfair, given the teacher's existing commitments and the fact that she's offering to help despite the inconvenience. \n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong because she's not required to help outside her responsibilities. She's being fair by offering to tutor for a fee, which is reasonable. The parent's anger is misplaced, as the teacher is already giving a lot without compensation. So the answer should be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
