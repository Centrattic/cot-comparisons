The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring to her own students, which she already does after school. A parent from another school asks if she can also tutor their son, who goes to a different school in another county. The teacher agrees to do it but only if the kid can come to her session, which starts at 2:50 PM. However, the other school lets out 30 minutes later, so the kid can't make it. The parent then asks if the teacher can tutor the boy separately. The teacher says she can, but since she has to stay later, she wants to charge $25 per session because the going rate is $30. The parent gets really upset, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring to her own students. She's not required to do that, and she's even paying for snacks. So offering free help is on her part. The parent's son is from another school, which complicates things because the teacher isn't responsible for him. The parent's request is outside the teacher's normal duties. The teacher is willing to accommodate the time issue by offering a separate session, but that would require her to stay later, which is tiring for her. She's also a parent herself with her own child to take care of after work. \n\nThe teacher decides to charge for this extra time, which is reasonable given the local market rate. The parent's reaction is extreme and unprofessional. The teacher didn't have to do this at all. She's already giving her time for free to her own students. The parent is upset about money, but the teacher isn't in a position where she's obligated to provide this service for free. The accusations that the teacher is selfish or doesn't care are baseless because she's willing to help, but at a fair cost for her time. \n\nSo, based on this, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's making a reasonable request for compensation for her time beyond her regular free tutoring. The parent's behavior is inappropriate and unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
