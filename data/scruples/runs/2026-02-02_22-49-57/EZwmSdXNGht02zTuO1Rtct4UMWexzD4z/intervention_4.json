The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the teacher is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, right after dismissal, and include a snack they pay for themselves. That's pretty generous. The parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, but he's in a different county and school, which ends 30 minutes later. So the kid can't make it to the existing tutoring sessions.\n\nThe teacher agrees to see the child separately if the parent can get him there by 4:15 PM. But the teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 after teaching all day and has her own son to take care of at home. She offers to do it for $25 per session, which is under the local rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points.\n\n1. **Time and Energy**: The teacher is already giving her time after school for free, which is demanding. She's in a low-income area, so the snacks are a personal expense. She's already stretched thin. Adding another student would require her to stay much later, which she's physically and mentally unable to do after a long day. That's a valid concern.\n\n2. **Compensation Request**: She's asking for $25 per hour, which is less than the market rate. The parent is upset because she expected free help. But the teacher is asking for compensation for her time, which is reasonable, especially if she's giving up her own time and energy. It's not a conflict of interest to charge for tutoring outside her school's policy, since the student isn't hers to begin with.\n\n3. **Parent's Reaction**: The parent's response is aggressive and unprofessional. They made personal attacks, which is inappropriate regardless of the situation. The teacher is in a difficult position, trying to help but also needing to set boundaries.\n\n4. **Alternatives**: Maybe the parent could have found another tutor, or the other school could have offered support. But the teacher isn't obligated to help students outside her school or district. She already does a lot for her own students. Asking for compensation for extra time isn't unreasonable.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: While the teacher wants to help, she's human and has her own responsibilities. Expecting her to work late without pay after a long day is a lot. Charging market rate might be fair, especially since she's not being reimbursed by the school for this.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's set clear boundaries, offered a solution with compensation, and the parent overreacted. The teacher's main issue is being overburdened and needing to prioritize her own well-being, which is valid.\n"
