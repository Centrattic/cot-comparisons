The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher who wrote the post is in the wrong for not helping another student by tutoring outside of the regular schedule.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, which is generous. They have a set schedule, and the other parent's child is from a different school and county. The parent asked the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate the other child, which would mean the child arrives later, and the teacher is already tired by then. The teacher offers to tutor for $25 per session instead of doing it for free, which the parent took badly.\n\nThe teacher's situation is that they're already giving up their time and resources (snacks, time after school) for free. They can't just extend their time without compensation because they have their own family responsibilities. The parent, however, is upset about the cost, especially since the teacher is a public school teacher in a low-income area. \n\nThe key points here are the teacher's existing commitment, the logistical challenges of the other child (different school hours, distance), and the parent's reaction. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside of their own students, especially when it's not feasible. Charging a fee in this case is reasonable since they're offering their own time and expertise beyond their current free service. The parent's anger seems misplaced, as the teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for extra work. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They provided a service beyond their required duties and made a reasonable request for compensation when the situation wasn't feasible for free. The parent's reaction is more about the cost and misunderstanding the teacher's position.\n"
