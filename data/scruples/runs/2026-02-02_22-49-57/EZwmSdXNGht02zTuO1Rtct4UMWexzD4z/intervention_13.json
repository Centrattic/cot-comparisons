The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The teacher is asking if they're the asshole for not helping a student from another school. Let's look at the facts.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students in the rural area. They even pay for snacks themselves. That's a lot of dedication. Then a parent from another school contacts them, asking for tutoring for her son who's in a different county. The teacher agrees to help if the kid can make it on time, but the school schedule makes that impossible. The parent then wants separate sessions, which would mean the teacher has to stay late until 4:15. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, has to drive home, and help their own son with homework. They ask for $25 per session, which is below the local tutor rate. The parent gets angry and calls them names, saying they're selfish and only in it for money.\n\nSo, the teacher is in a tough spot. They're already giving up their time for free to help their own students. The new request would add more time and effort without the usual compensation. The teacher's own responsibilities and energy are valid concerns. The parent's reaction seems unreasonable because the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school district, especially when it's not feasible. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for their time. The parent's accusations are unfair since the teacher is already doing a lot for free. So I think the answer is B.\n"
