The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The teacher is asking if they're the asshole for not helping a student from another school. They already tutor their own students for free, providing snacks and time after school. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, but he's in a different county and school that lets out later. The teacher offered to do it separately but at a cost of $25 per session. The parent got angry and called them names, saying they were selfish and only in it for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already giving their time and resources for free to their own students. They can't just extend that indefinitely, especially since they have their own family responsibilities. The other parent's child is in a different school district, so the teacher isn't obligated to help them. The teacher tried to accommodate by adjusting the timing but realized it would be too much, both in terms of time and energy. They asked for payment, which is reasonable given the going rate in the area. The parent's reaction seems excessive and unfair because the teacher isn't responsible for that student and is already making sacrifices. The teacher isn't in the wrong here because they set boundaries and tried to be helpful within their limits. The parent's anger is misplaced, attacking the teacher's character instead of addressing the situation rationally. So, the answer should be B, the teacher isn't the asshole.\n"
