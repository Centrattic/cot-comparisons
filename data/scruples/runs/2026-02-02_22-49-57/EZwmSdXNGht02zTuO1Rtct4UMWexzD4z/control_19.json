The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school for their own students. They mention that they tutor those in need without charging, which aligns with their district's policy. Then a parent from another school approaches them, asking for their child who's in a different county and has a later dismissal time.\n\nThe teacher offers to tutor this child but only if the parent can get the child there on time. Since the child can't make it by the regular time, the parent asks if they can come later. The teacher then sets a new time and charges $25 per session. The parent reacts negatively, calling them names and accusing them of caring only about money.\n\nSo the key points here are: the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students. The new request is outside the teacher's school and county, which complicates things. The teacher is willing to adjust their schedule but wants compensation, which is a reasonable request given the time and effort involved. The parent is upset about the charge, but the teacher isn't doing this for their own students for free either, but the district's conflict of interest policy prevents them from charging there. \n\nThe teacher has a valid reason to charge for tutoring a student from another school, especially since it's outside their regular duties and would require extra time after a long day. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the teacher isn't obligated to help without compensation, especially given the logistical challenges. The teacher isn't being selfish; they're setting boundaries for their time and energy. \n\nTherefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They provided an offer, made clear the terms, and the parent didn't agree, but the teacher isn't obligated to help without payment. The parent's accusations are unwarranted.\n"
