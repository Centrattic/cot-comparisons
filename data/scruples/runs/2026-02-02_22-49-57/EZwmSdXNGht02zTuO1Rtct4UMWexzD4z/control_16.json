The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students because they can't charge due to conflict of interest rules. They mention they pay for snacks themselves and that the tutoring starts right after school ends. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who is in a different county and school with a later dismissal time.\n\nThe teacher is already committed to their own students and the timing is an issue. The parent expects the teacher to adjust their schedule, which would mean the student arrives late. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM, after teaching a full day, and has their own son to help with at home. They offer to tutor for $25 per session, which is below the market rate mentioned ($30). The parent reacts negatively, accusing the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher has a policy of free tutoring but only for their own students. The parent's son is in a different school, so it's outside the teacher's responsibility. The teacher isn't obligated to help beyond their own duties. The parent's request is outside the scope of the teacher's role, especially considering the logistical issues. The teacher is within their rights to say no and even charge for their time if they choose to help. The parent's reaction seems unreasonable given the circumstances. The teacher isn't in the wrong for not helping and setting boundaries.\n"
