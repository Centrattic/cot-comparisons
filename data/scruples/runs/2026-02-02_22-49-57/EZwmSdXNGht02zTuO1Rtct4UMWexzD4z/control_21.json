The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already provides free tutoring after school for their own students, which takes a lot of time and effort. They even pay for snacks themselves. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because he leaves school later, so he'd arrive at 4:15. The teacher is already tired by 4:15 after teaching all day and has her own son to help with homework. So she offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nHmm. The teacher is doing a lot already for free. She's in a rural, low-income area, so charging might be an issue for some. But the parent in question is from another school, so maybe the teacher isn't responsible for that student. Also, the timing is impossible with the teacher's schedule. The parent might expect free help because the teacher does it for her own students, but this is a different school. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her own students. She's also being respectful by offering payment since she's not supposed to tutor for free due to conflict of interest policies. The parent's reaction is pretty harsh. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's already giving her time and resources to her own students. She's reasonable in asking for compensation, especially since it's outside her usual commitments. The parent's response is inappropriate. So answer B.\n"
