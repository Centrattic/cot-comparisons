The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school, which they already do for their own students. The snacks are paid for out of pocket, which shows they're already giving a lot of their time and money. \n\nThen, a parent from another school contacts the teacher about their son. The teacher agrees to help if the kid can make it by 2:50 PM. However, the child's school ends an hour later and can't arrive in time. The parent then asks if the teacher can adjust the time to accommodate the child arriving at 4:15 PM. \n\nThe teacher is already drained by 4:15 PM, has a long drive home, and needs to help their own son with homework. They offer to tutor for $25 per session instead. The parent reacts angrily, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nNow, considering the teacher's perspective: they're already giving a lot of their time and personal resources. The new request would require them to stay much later, which isn't feasible for them. They're not in a position to provide unpaid tutoring beyond their current commitments. Charging for their time is a way to set boundaries, especially since they can't do it for free anymore. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems unfair. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their established schedule, especially when it's not their student. The teacher's refusal isn't about money but about sustainability and personal limits. The parent's accusations are baseless because the teacher is already helping others for free. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They set clear terms, communicated the time issue, and offered a paid alternative when the free option wasn't feasible. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding the teacher's limits and personal circumstances.\n"
