The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring another student. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which takes 45 minutes immediately after school. They pay for snacks themselves, which shows dedication. The parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who is in a different county and their school lets out later. So, the timing doesn't work with the existing schedule.\n\nThe teacher offered to tutor separately but asked for $25 per session, which is under the local rate. The parent was upset, called the teacher names, and accused them of not caring. The teacher is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider the teacher's situation. They have their own job, their own son to help with homework, and a long drive home. The existing tutoring is unpaid, and they can't just extend their time for free because they're already exhausted by 4:15 PM. Asking for $25 is fair compensation for their time, especially since they're going beyond their normal duties.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems harsh. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school or the existing free sessions. The parent shouldn't expect free services, especially when the child isn't even in their class or school. The teacher isn't in the wrong here for setting boundaries and seeking fair pay for their time. So the answer should be B.\n"
