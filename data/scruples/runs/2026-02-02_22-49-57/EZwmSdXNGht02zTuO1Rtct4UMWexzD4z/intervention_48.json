The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school district. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for her own students in a low-income area. She's taking time after school, providing snacks, and doing this without pay. Now, a parent from another district asks if the teacher can tutor their son. The problem is that the other school is in a different county and ends later, so the kid can't make the existing tutoring session. The parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule to accommodate this.\n\nThe teacher is already working extra hours, and she has her own son to take care of after work. She mentions she's out of energy by 4:15. She offers to tutor for $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nHmm. The teacher is providing free help for her own students, which is commendable. But when someone outside her responsibility (different school district, different county) asks for help, she's not obligated to do it, especially since it would interfere with her personal time. The parent expects the teacher to adjust her schedule and do it for free, but the teacher sets a boundary by asking for compensation. The parent's reaction is hostile, but the teacher isn't wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's existing workload, her own responsibilities, and the fact that the student isn't even in her school district. She's already giving her time and resources without expecting anything in return. The parent's request is outside the scope of her duty, so the teacher isn't in the wrong for declining, especially after offering a reasonable fee. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but the teacher isn't the asshole here.\n"
