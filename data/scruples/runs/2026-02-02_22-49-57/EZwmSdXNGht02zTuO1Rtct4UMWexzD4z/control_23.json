The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the teacher not helping a student from another school because of time and compensation issues.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students in a low-income area. They provide snacks, which they pay for themselves. That shows they're already giving a lot without expecting anything. Now, a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their son. The child is in another county and can't arrive on time because their school lets out later. The teacher offers to tutor separately but wants $25 per session, which leads to the parent getting angry.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's existing workload, the fact that the student isn't even in their school, and the teacher's right to set boundaries. The teacher isn't obligated to take on extra work, especially when it conflicts with their own schedule and family responsibilities. Charging for tutoring isn't against their district's policy, so the $25 fee is understandable. The parent's reaction seems over the top and accusatory, which might indicate they were unreasonable. The teacher isn't in the wrong here because they\u2019ve already contributed a lot for free and can't be expected to help outside their capacity without compensation. So the answer should be B.\n"
