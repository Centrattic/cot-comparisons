The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school for her own students because she works in a low-income area. She provides snacks and does this without getting paid, which the district prohibits. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their son, who is in a different county. The teacher agrees but only if the kid can come after her regular session. But the kid can't make it until 4:15, which is too late for her because she's already exhausted by then and has to get home to help her own son.\n\nShe offers to tutor him for $25 per session, which is under the local market rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calls her names, accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish. The teacher is now questioning if she's the asshole for not helping without pay.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for free. She\u2019s giving her time, providing snacks, and helping her own students after school. She\u2019s in a rural area with limited resources, so maybe there aren't many other options for tutoring. The parent from another school is asking her to go beyond her current capacity. The teacher has her own responsibilities and can't just extend her day indefinitely. \n\nThe parent might be in a tough spot too, but expecting the teacher to do this for free when she's already stretched thin is unreasonable. The teacher is asking for compensation, which is fair since she's giving up her time and energy. The parent's reaction is harsh and invalidates the teacher's need to set boundaries. \n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to help someone outside her school, especially when it conflicts with her personal time and duties. By asking for payment, she's acknowledging the value of her time, which is reasonable. The parent's anger stems from not wanting to pay, not necessarily from the teacher's refusal to help. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. She's setting clear boundaries and asking for fair compensation for her time. The parent's actions were unkind and dismissive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
