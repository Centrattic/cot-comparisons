The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher in the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a teacher who offers free tutoring after school for her own students in a low-income area. A parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor the parent's son, who is in a different county and school. The teacher initially agrees if the child can make it on time, but the parent's son arrives late. The teacher then offers to tutor separately but charges $25 per session because she's tired by 4:15 PM and has to drive home and help her own son. The parent gets angry and calls her names. The user thinks the teacher is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students, which she does at her own expense (snacks, time, energy). She's in a rural, low-income area where parents might not have resources. When a parent from another school asks for help, the teacher is sympathetic but can't accommodate the timing. The key point is the teacher charging for the service. Since the district doesn't allow charging students, but the parent isn't from her school, maybe it's a different scenario. The teacher is offering her time outside her regular schedule and is asking for compensation for her own time and energy, which is reasonable. The parent's reaction is extreme, but does the teacher have the right to charge?\n\nThe teacher is not obligated to provide free tutoring beyond her own students. She's already doing a lot for her class. The parent's son is in a different school, so it's not part of the teacher's responsibility. The teacher's boundaries here are reasonable. She's setting limits on her time and availability, which is important for her own well-being. Charging $25 is under the market rate, so maybe she's being fair. The parent's anger might stem from not expecting to pay, especially if they come from a low-income background. But the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for her time. She's also human and needs time for her own family. \n\nAnother angle: the teacher is a professional, but she's not a charity. She can choose her clients and set terms. The parent's child is in a different district, so the teacher isn't bound by any school policy to provide free tutoring. The emotional abuse from the parent is unfair, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for refusing or charging. The answer should be B (No), the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's maintained her boundaries and acted reasonably.\n"
