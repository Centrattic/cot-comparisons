The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school. The situation is that the teacher already provides free tutoring for her own students in a low-income area. A parent from another school, who's a friend of a student the teacher already tutors, wants the teacher to tutor her son as well. The problem is the son goes to a different school that ends later, so he can't make the existing sessions. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but charges $25 per session because she's already giving her time for free to others. The parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is in a rural, low-economic area where charging for tutoring is against the district's policy. She's already providing free tutoring with her own time and money (for snacks). She's not required to tutor outside her school, especially for another district's student. The parent's son is in a different county with a later dismissal time, making it hard to fit into her schedule. She's already exhausted by 4:15 PM and has her own responsibilities. Charging $25 is her way to compensate for her time since she can't offer it for free here.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher isn't obligated to help beyond her existing commitments, especially when it's not her students or school. The key points here are the teacher's boundaries and the parent's unreasonable expectations. The teacher is not in the wrong because she's already going above and beyond for her own students and has the right to set limits on her time and energy. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding or unrealistic expectations, not the teacher's decision to charge for her time in this specific case.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in not providing free tutoring for another district's student and charging when she can't offer it for free. The parent's outburst is unwarranted given the circumstances.\n"
