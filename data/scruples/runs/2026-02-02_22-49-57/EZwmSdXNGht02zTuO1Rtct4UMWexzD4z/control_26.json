The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher here is in the wrong. So the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring sessions for their own students after school. They provide snacks, pay for them themselves, and the tutoring is free because of school policy. Then a parent from another school contacts them about tutoring her son, who goes to a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher says they can't do the free sessions because the timing doesn't work, and offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent gets really upset, calls the teacher names, and accuses them of being selfish and not caring about the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's side. They're already volunteering their time and money for their own students. They have a set schedule that fits their own students, and this new request would require them to stay later, which is not feasible because they get home late and have their own son to help with homework. The teacher is asking for $25, which is less than the local tutoring rate of $30, so they might be making a sacrifice here. The parent's reaction is pretty harsh, but the teacher isn't obligated to help outside of their existing commitments.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might be frustrated because their child is struggling and they see the teacher as a resource. However, the teacher isn't their child's teacher, and the teacher's policy was to tutor their own students for free. The parent's son is in a different school, so the teacher isn't responsible for him. The teacher is within their rights to say no or charge for their time, especially since they already provide free services without compensation.\n\nI think the key points are the teacher's existing commitments, the policy against charging for tutoring their own students, and the parent's unreasonable expectations. The teacher isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries and being fair about their time. The parent is the one being unreasonable by attacking the teacher's character. So the answer should be B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
