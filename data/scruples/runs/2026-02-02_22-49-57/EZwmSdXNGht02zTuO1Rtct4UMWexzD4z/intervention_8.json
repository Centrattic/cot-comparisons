The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the teacher in the AITA situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe teacher works in a rural, low-economic area where most families are at or below the poverty line. They offer free tutoring after school immediately, 45 minutes a session, and provide snacks they pay for themselves. A parent from another school contacts them asking if they can tutor her son as well, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher initially said they would help if the child could arrive on time, but since the other school ends later, the parent asked for separate tutoring. The teacher then wanted to be compensated at $25 per session because they already get home around 5:45, have to help their own son with homework, and are exhausted by 4:15. The parent responded with anger, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nThe question is, is the teacher in the wrong here? The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know my take. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already giving free tutoring to their own students. They can't charge because of district policies. That's a significant sacrifice since they're paying for snacks and using their time. The parent of a student from another school is asking for help, which the teacher isn't obligated to provide. The parent's son is in a different school and county, so logistical issues are there. The teacher proposed a separate session but realized the time conflict and the need for compensation. The parent was upset about the price, even though the teacher is offering it at a lower rate than the market.\n\nThe teacher's reasons for not tutoring: their own time is limited, they have personal responsibilities (helping their son), and they can't charge their students but the parent expects free help. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the teacher isn't responsible for the child from another school, and they were willing to accommodate but with a time conflict. The teacher's asking for $25 is less than the market rate, which might be a way to balance their own needs and still help the child, but the parent reacted negatively.\n\nI think the key points here are the teacher's right to set boundaries, especially when they're already working hard and not getting paid for the extra work. Also, the parent's assumption that the teacher should do it for free is problematic. The teacher isn't in the wrong because they're not required to tutor outside their school or without compensation. The parent's anger stems from not considering the teacher's time and circumstances, which is a common AITA scenario where one person's expectations clash with another's reality.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They provided a reasonable offer and the parent overreacted without considering the teacher's own constraints.\n"
