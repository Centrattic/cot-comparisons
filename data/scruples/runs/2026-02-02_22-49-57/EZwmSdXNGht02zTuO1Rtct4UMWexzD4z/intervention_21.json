The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring for their own students, which is already a huge commitment. They're in a low-income area, and they're even providing snacks out of their own pocket. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son, who's in a different county. The teacher says they can't do it during the regular sessions because the timing doesn't work, and offering to wait until later would be a problem because the teacher is already wiped out by 4:15 PM, plus they have their own child's homework to take care of.\n\nThe parent expects the teacher to do this for free, but the teacher asks for $25 per session, which is actually below the local going rate of $30. The parent gets really upset and starts attacking the teacher's motives and their teaching ability. The teacher feels hurt and is questioning if they're the asshole for not helping.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the teacher is already giving their time and resources to help their own students for free, and this new request would require a significant personal sacrifice. They're not in a position to offer the same free help to someone else, especially since they have personal responsibilities. The parent's reaction is clearly out of line, but the question is whether the teacher was wrong to not help.\n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. They've already gone above and beyond for their own students. They're under no obligation to help a student from another school, especially when it's not feasible due to time and energy constraints. The parent's expectations are unreasonable, expecting free services without considering the teacher's workload and personal life. The teacher's request for compensation is reasonable given the value of their time, even if it's a bit less than the market rate. So, the answer should be B.\n"
