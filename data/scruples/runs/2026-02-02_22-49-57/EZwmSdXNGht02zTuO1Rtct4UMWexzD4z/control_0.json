The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for their own students. They mention that the district doesn't allow charging students, so they do it for free and even provide snacks. That's a lot of time and money they're putting in voluntarily.\n\nThen, a parent from another school contacts them. The teacher's student is being tutored, and the parent asks about their son. The teacher agrees to help if the child can make it on time. But the child is in a different county, with a later dismissal. The parent then wants separate sessions. The teacher's schedule is already tight, ending at 2:40, and the other school dismisses later. The teacher would have to start later, which would mean staying later in the day, but they also have their own son to help with homework and a long drive home. \n\nThe teacher offers $25/hour, which is less than the market rate of $30. The parent reacts angrily, calling them names and accusing them of not caring. The teacher feels hurt but questions if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points: The teacher is already giving their time for free. They can't adjust their schedule further without personal sacrifice. They offered to do it but asked for payment because they can't do it for free again. The parent's request is outside the original arrangement. The teacher isn't obligated to help another student from a different school, especially with logistical issues. Charging for that time is reasonable, and the parent's reaction is inappropriate. \n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong here. They provided a solution (charging) when the situation was different from their original commitment. The parent's anger is misplaced. The answer should be B.\n"
