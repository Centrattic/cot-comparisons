The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to their own students, which is already a big deal because she's doing it for free and providing snacks. She's in a rural, low-income area, so the kids probably need the help.\n\nThen a parent from another school contacts her about tutoring their son. The kid is in a different county and school, which dismisses later. The teacher says if he can get there on time, she'll help. But the parent's son can't make it because of the school schedule. So he'd arrive at 4:15, which is after the teacher's usual tutoring time. The teacher then offers to tutor him separately but charges $25 per session, which is under the local going rate of $30. The parent gets really upset, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring about kids.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The key points here are: the teacher was already providing free tutoring for her own students. The new request is for a student from another school district, which complicates things. She can't adjust her schedule because she's already exhausted by 4:15 and needs to get home to help her own son. Charging for tutoring isn't against district policy here, since it's mentioned that charging is a conflict of interest for her own students but not in this case. She's asking for compensation because her time is valuable, and she's not in a position to offer free tutoring outside her already committed time. \n\nThe parent's reaction is extreme and unprofessional, attacking her character. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her own students, especially when it's not feasible to adjust her schedule. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and charging for her time in this specific case. She's already doing a lot for her own students for free. The parent's anger is misplaced because the teacher isn't required to help another school's student, especially with the logistical issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
