The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The author is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school for their own students, including snacks they pay for themselves. A parent from another school asked for tutoring for her son, but he's in a different county that ends an hour later. The author offered to tutor if the child could come on time, but the parent couldn't manage that and then asked if the author could wait for her son separately. The author said they were too tired by 4:15 and their own responsibilities, so they offered paid tutoring at $25 per session. The parent got angry, called them names, accused them of not caring and being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a generous gesture given the economic conditions. The parent approached them for a student outside their school district. The author tried to accommodate by setting conditions but couldn't due to timing and personal capacity. Offering to charge the going rate when the school's policy doesn't allow it for their own students might be a conflict, but the parent's son is from another school. \n\nWait, the author says their district forbids charging students they teach. But the parent's child is from another county, so maybe the policy doesn't apply here. The author could charge in this case. However, the parent was upset about the fee. The author's main point is that they can't realistically tutor another student outside their school's schedule and their own time. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems harsh and unjustified. The author isn't obligated to help out-of-district students, especially when it conflicts with their personal time and existing commitments. The fact that the parent's son is in a different school and can't meet the original schedule makes it logistically difficult. The author provided an alternative solution (charging a fee), which the parent refused to accept, instead attacking the author. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were trying to help but had real limitations. The parent's accusations of selfishness and money motives are unwarranted, given the author's prior free services and the fact that they offered a solution. The author isn't required to extend their time indefinitely, especially when it affects their personal life and well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
