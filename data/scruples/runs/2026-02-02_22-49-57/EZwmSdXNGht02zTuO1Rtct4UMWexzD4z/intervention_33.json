The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school for her own students, using her own time and money for snacks. A parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who is in a different county and school. The teacher agrees to help if the child can make it on time. But the child can't, so the parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry and accuses her of not caring about kids.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for her own students without pay. She's in a rural, low-income area, so resources might be tight. She's going above and beyond by providing snacks and time. Now, someone from another district is asking for a favor that would require her to stay later, which she's already done. But the timing doesn't work because the other kid's school ends later. The parent then wants her to wait, which would mean the teacher has to stay even longer, cutting into her own time to help her son with homework and get home later. She's not obligated to do this for free, especially since it's outside her school's hours and responsibilities. \n\nThe teacher sets a reasonable rate ($25/hour) which is even cheaper than the local market rate. The parent's reaction is out of line. They're in a different school district, so the teacher isn't responsible for their child's education. The parent's anger stems from the teacher not providing free help, which is understandable but unfair. The teacher isn't in the wrong here because she's not required to tutor outside her role, especially when it affects her personal time and energy. She's already given a fair offer, and the parent's response is the real issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
