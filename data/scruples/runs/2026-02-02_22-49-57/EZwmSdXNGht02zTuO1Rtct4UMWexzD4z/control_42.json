The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school for her own students. She's already taking time out of her day to help, providing snacks, and doing it for free because her district doesn't allow charging students. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who's in a different school district and has a later dismissal time.\n\nThe teacher initially agrees but realizes the child can't make it during her regular sessions. She's willing to adjust her schedule, but only if the parent can get the kid there on time. When the parent can't, she offers to tutor separately but asks for $25 per session, which is below the local going rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about kids.\n\nNow, the key points here: The teacher is already doing a lot for her own students without pay. She's not required to tutor outside her school or district. The parent is asking for a service that's beyond her current commitments. The teacher is offering to help but wants compensation for the additional time, especially since she has her own family responsibilities. The parent's reaction is hostile and unwarranted. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? She's within her rights to set boundaries. She's already giving her time for free. Asking for payment for extra hours isn't unreasonable, especially considering the time and energy. The parent's accusations seem harsh. The teacher isn't obligated to help another district's student, so she's not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
