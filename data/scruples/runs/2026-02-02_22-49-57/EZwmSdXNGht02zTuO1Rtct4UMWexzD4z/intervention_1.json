The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring to their own students, which is already a generous gesture. They mention that the school district prohibits charging students, so their free sessions are purely voluntary. The parent of another student from a different county asks for tutoring, but the timing doesn't work because the other school lets out later. The teacher offers to adjust their schedule but then sets a fee. The parent gets angry, calling the teacher names and accusing them of caring only about money.\n\nThe teacher's main points are about time and energy. They get home late and have their own child to help. Charging $25 per session is because the standard rate is $30, and they want compensation. The parent's reaction is harsh and unprofessional.\n\nI need to consider the teacher's obligations. They're already providing free tutoring for their own students. Tutoring someone from another district isn't their responsibility. Plus, the timing makes it impractical. The teacher is within their rights to set boundaries. The parent should have considered the logistics before making the request. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school's policies or personal time. The fee might be a point of contention, but since the school doesn't allow charging, offering a fee for a different student might be a way to cover personal costs, not exploitation. The parent's harsh response is definitely uncalled for. So the teacher isn't in the wrong here.\n"
