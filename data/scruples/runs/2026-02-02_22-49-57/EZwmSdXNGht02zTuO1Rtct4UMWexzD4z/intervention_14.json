The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the teacher is being asked if they're the asshole for not helping another student by tutoring them. The situation is that the teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students, but a parent from another school wants them to tutor her son, which would require different timing and the teacher is asking for payment. The parent got really upset and accused the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for free. They tutor their own students without charging, even providing snacks. That's a lot of extra work and personal expense. Now, someone is asking for the same service but under different circumstances. The teacher isn't obligated to do this, especially since the student isn't even in their class or school district. The parent's son has a later dismissal time, making the teacher's usual schedule impossible. Then the teacher offers to do it for a fee, which is fair because they're giving up personal time. The parent was angry about the charge, but the teacher is within their rights to set their own terms.\n\nThe key points here are that the teacher isn't required to tutor outside their job responsibilities. They're already doing more than their duty by offering free sessions. Charging for additional time is reasonable, especially considering the teacher's own family needs. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the teacher isn't in a position to provide the same free service to someone outside their school. The teacher isn't in the wrong here; they're managing their time and setting boundaries, which is necessary. So the answer should be B.\n"
