The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student by tutoring for a fee. \n\nFirst, the teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students, which is commendable, especially in a low-economic area. They even pay for snacks themselves. That shows dedication.\n\nThen, a parent from another school contacts the teacher asking to tutor her son. But the kid is in a different county and school, which ends later. So getting him to the tutoring time isn't feasible. The teacher is kind enough to consider it, but the logistics are tough.\n\nThe teacher offers to do the tutoring separately but only if the child arrives by 4:15. However, the teacher gets to work at 6:30 AM and by 4:15 PM, they're already tired. Plus, they have their own son's homework to help with. So the timing doesn't work for the teacher's schedule and energy levels. That makes sense\u2014people need rest too.\n\nThe teacher then sets a fee, $25 per session, which is under the market rate. The parent gets angry, accuses the teacher of being selfish and not caring. The teacher feels hurt but is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points: The teacher was already giving their time for free. They tried to accommodate but the situation wasn't practical. They asked for compensation because of the time and effort. The parent's reaction seems harsh, but the teacher's decision is understandable. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor another school's student, especially when it's not feasible. Charging for time when it's not part of their free program is reasonable. The parent's accusations are probably unfair. Hence, the teacher isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
