I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is at fault in their situation with their friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend comes from a less privileged background, and the author has been generous with gifts, family vacations, and even helped buy a car. The friend is in debt, struggles with school, and can't move out. The author offered a place to stay but the friend declined due to her dog and allergies.\n\nAt work, the friend is making mistakes, and the author is defending her despite the issues. The friend then accuses the author of being spoiled and starts spreading negative things about her. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which affects her work performance slightly. The friend blames the author for her work mistakes and even talks to her boyfriend negatively. The author now wants to cut ties but fears her parents might fire the friend if she does.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's resentment and the author's position of privilege. The friend seems to be acting out of jealousy and taking out her frustrations on the author. The author, on the other hand, has been supportive but is now feeling attacked and wants to end the friendship. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The friend's behavior is toxic and unfounded. The author's generosity doesn't obligate her to maintain a harmful friendship. Also, the friend's accusations and gossip are clearly the problem here. The author's decision to stop the friendship isn't malicious; it's about self-preservation. The parents' potential reaction is a consequence of the friend's poor performance, not the author's decision to end the friendship. So, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
