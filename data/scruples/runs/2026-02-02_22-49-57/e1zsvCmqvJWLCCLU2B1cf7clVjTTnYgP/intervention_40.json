I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in their situation with their friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time, like family. The author comes from a wealthy background, which has given them advantages\u2014no debt from school, family support, and a job in the family business. The friend, on the other hand, has faced financial struggles, is in debt, and hasn't had the same opportunities. The author has been supportive by offering vacations, gifts, even a car, and a job at the family business.\n\nNow, the friend started working in the warehouse, but her performance has been problematic. The author defends her because they think her intentions are good. However, the friend has become resentful. She accused the author of faking depression and being a leach, spread negative things about her to others, and acted nice to her face. The author wants to cut ties, knowing that doing so might lead to the friend losing her job and support from the author's parents.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author has been generous, providing financial support and opportunities. The friend's actions are clearly unkind and toxic\u2014spreading lies, being dishonest, and acting out of resentment. The author's decision to stop being friends could be seen as self-preservation, especially given the friend's behavior and the potential negative impact on the workplace. However, the author might feel conflicted because they initially wanted to help, but the friend's actions have made it impossible to maintain the friendship.\n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't responsible for the friend's resentment or the friend's poor work performance. The friend's reaction is her own choice, not the author's fault. The author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice to protect themselves from a toxic situation. Since the friend is acting out of jealousy and is unkind, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties. The author's support was genuine, and the friendship was one-sided in the friend's behavior.\n"
