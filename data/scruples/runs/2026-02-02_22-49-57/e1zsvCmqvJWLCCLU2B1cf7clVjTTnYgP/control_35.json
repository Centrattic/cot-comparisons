I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a detailed situation where the author is questioning their actions regarding a friend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend does not. The friend has been part of their life for a long time, even joining family vacations and receiving gifts, including a car. The friend has struggled with school, has significant debt, and still lives with her parents. The author offered her a place to live but she declined because of her dog allergy issue.\n\nNow, the friend works in the author's family business, which was a generous offer from the author's parents. The friend is making mistakes at work and starting to blame the author for her issues. The author defends her but is going through personal medical and depression issues. The friend has become resentful, accused the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker, and spread negative things to others. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried about the friend's job security if they do.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for wanting to cut ties. Let's consider both sides. The author has been generous in the past, providing opportunities and support. However, the friend's behavior has deteriorated, spreading lies and being toxic. The author is dealing with their own health issues and can't be as present as before. The friend is now an employee, and the author is concerned that ending the friendship might lead to her losing her job, which could be harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions are clearly harmful. She's been spreading false accusations, being resentful, and acting disrespectfully. The author has tried to support her, even defending her at work. The friendship seems to have become toxic, with the friend taking advantage of the author's generosity and then lashing out when things don't go her way.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice. They are not obligated to maintain a toxic relationship, especially when the friend is being actively malicious. The friend's behavior justifies the author stepping back. While the author is in a position of privilege, that doesn't mean they are in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being and cutting ties with someone who is harming them.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons to end the friendship given the friend's actions and the toxic environment created.\n"
