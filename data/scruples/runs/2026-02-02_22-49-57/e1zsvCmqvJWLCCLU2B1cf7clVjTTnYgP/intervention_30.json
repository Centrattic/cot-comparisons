I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend comes from a less privileged background. The author's family has supported her financially, even buying her a car and including her in vacations. The author has opportunities because of her family's wealth, while the friend faces challenges like school debt and difficulty finding a good job. \n\nThe friend works in the family business but is making mistakes, and she's blaming the author for her issues. The author has been defending her, but the friend's resentment is growing. The friend started spreading negative things about the author, leading to the author wanting to end the friendship. The key point here is whether the author is at fault for prioritizing their own well-being over maintaining the friendship.\n\nI need to consider if the author did something to deserve the friend's behavior. The author mentions that they offered support, like a place to live, but the friend declined. The author is currently dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their availability as a friend. The friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors and being toxic\u2014are definitely problematic. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for cutting off a friend who is being abusive and spreading lies. The friend's jealousy and resentment are her own issues, and the author has a right to protect their mental health. Even though the author is in a better position financially, that doesn't mean they're responsible for the friend's problems. The decision to end the friendship isn't the author's fault.\n"
