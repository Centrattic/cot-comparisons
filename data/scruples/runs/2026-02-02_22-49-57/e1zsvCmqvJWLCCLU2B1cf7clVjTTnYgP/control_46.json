I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their friend. They've been friends a long time, but now there's tension. The author comes from a wealthier family and has had it easier\u2014no debt, parents bought their friend a car, etc. The friend, on the other hand, has financial struggles, owes a lot in school debt, and can't move out. \n\nThe author offered to help by letting the friend live with them, but the friend refused because of her dog, which the author is allergic to. That's a valid reason, I think. Then the friend got a job at the author's family business, which actually paid more than they were expecting. But since then, their relationship has deteriorated.\n\nThe author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which has made them less active as a friend. The friend is making mistakes at work and blaming the author for not giving orders quickly enough. The author's parents are frustrated, but the author defends the friend. The friend, in turn, is spreading rumors, calling the author a spoilt brat, and even trying to sabotage their relationship with the boyfriend. The author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing that their parents might then fire her, which could leave the friend without a job or support.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author has been supportive in the past (gifts, car, job offer), but the friend is now acting out, being resentful, and spreading harmful rumors. The author is justified in feeling done with the friendship, especially given the friend's toxic behavior. The friend's actions are clearly hurtful and undermining, which the author has every right to be upset about. The author's decision to end the friendship isn't out of spite but because the friend is being actively harmful. Even though the friend is in a difficult situation, her response is unkind and ungrateful. The author isn't at fault here; they've done a lot to support the friend, and the friend's actions are her own responsibility. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
