I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is friends with someone they've known forever. The friend comes from a less well-off background, and the author's family has given her a lot\u2014vacations, gifts, even a car. The author has a good job in their family business, while the friend is in debt, struggling with school, and now works in the warehouse for the same business. The friend is making mistakes, and the author is trying to defend her, but the friend is becoming resentful. The friend spreads negative things about the author, and now the author wants to cut ties, knowing that their parents might fire her if they stop supporting her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's family has been very generous. They provided financial support and opportunities to the friend. That seems like a genuine effort to help, even though their family is wealthier. The friend, on the other hand, is in a tough spot financially and has been struggling academically and professionally.\n\nThe friend is working in the warehouse now, which was offered to her by the author's parents. The author mentions that the friend is making mistakes and has started blaming the author for delays. The author has a medical condition that causes them to slow down a bit, but it's only 30 minutes. The friend, though, seems to hold that against the author, even going as far as calling them an attention-seeker and spreading negative things to others. The author is also dealing with depression, which affects their ability to be as active a friend as before.\n\nThe author is considering ending the friendship, knowing that without their support, the friend might lose her job. The key issue here is whether the author is at fault for wanting to cut ties, especially given the friend's behavior and the potential consequences.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've been supportive, but the friend's resentment and actions (spreading rumors, pretending to be nice, etc.) have made the relationship toxic. The author is also dealing with their own health issues, which is a valid reason for not being able to maintain the friendship as before.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the author has been unapproachable due to their medical issues and might have felt neglected. However, the friend's response\u2014spreading lies and being deceitful\u2014seems extreme and hurtful. The author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as self-preservation, especially given the friend's toxic behavior.\n\nThe author is not in a position where they have to support the friend financially or through their family's business, but they've been doing so. However, the friend's actions now are damaging the author's reputation and personal life. The author has the right to distance themselves from someone who is being malicious, even if it means the friend might face consequences. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that is harmful to their well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are the primary issue here. The author has done their part to support and help the friend, but the friend's resentment and malice make the relationship unhealthy. Ending the friendship is a reasonable response to protect oneself from further harm.\n"
