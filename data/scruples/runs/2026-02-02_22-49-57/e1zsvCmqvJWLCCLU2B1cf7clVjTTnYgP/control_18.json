I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two friends where one, the author, comes from a wealthier background and has had an easier life. The other friend, let's call her Friend B, is struggling financially and has been given opportunities by the author's family, like vacations, gifts, even a car. The author has also offered a place to stay, but Friend B declined because of her dog allergies.\n\nNow, Friend B is working in the author's family business, which the author manages. The author has been defending her at work despite her mistakes, but Friend B is starting to blame the author for her own errors, especially related to the author's medical issues. Friend B has become resentful, said negative things about the author to others, including the author's boyfriend, and has made false accusations. The author is considering cutting ties with Friend B, knowing that this would likely lead to Friend B losing her job and support from the author's family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did anything to deserve this treatment. The author mentions that they've been going through medical and personal issues, which might affect their ability to be as active a friend. They've tried to support Friend B by defending her at work and offering help, even when declined. The author's actions seem to be in good faith, trying to support a friend despite personal challenges.\n\nFriend B, on the other hand, has a history of struggling, but her reaction seems to be more about resentment over their differing life circumstances. She's taking out her frustrations on the author, spreading rumors, and even lying about the author's health. This behavior is toxic and harmful, regardless of her own problems.\n\nThe author is now considering cutting ties, which is a personal decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship given Friend B's actions. The author isn't doing anything unethical by ending a friendship, especially after being mistreated. The key here is that the author is responding to Friend B's behavior, not initiating the conflict. The author's decision is also about their own well-being given the ongoing harassment and false accusations.\n\nThe potential consequence is that Friend B might lose her job, but the author is not necessarily responsible for that outcome. The author's parents are the ones employing her, and if they decide to terminate her due to performance issues, that's their choice. The author's role is more about managing the business, and if Friend B isn't performing, it's her own actions that lead to possible job loss.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship after being treated poorly. The responsibility for the friendship's demise lies with Friend B's actions. The author is justified in seeking to protect their own mental health and work environment.\n"
