I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they're curious for my input.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The author and their friend have been close since forever. The author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, and even a car from the author's parents. The author graduated without debt, moved out at 18, and works in the family business. The friend struggled in school, has over $50k in debt, still lives with her parents, and works in the warehouse at the family business. \n\nThe friend's resentment seems to have grown after starting a job there. The author defends her at work despite her mistakes. The friend accuses the author of being depressed to get attention and spreads negative things about her to others, pretending to be nice in person. The author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that her parents might then treat her as just an employee and possibly fire her if she makes more errors.\n\nThe author is questioning if they are the asshole (AITA) for cutting off the friend. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to assess both sides. The author provided a lot of support to the friend, including financial help, job opportunities, and family inclusion. The friend, on the other hand, started blaming the author for her mistakes at work and spread negativity. The author is now facing a toxic situation where the friend's behavior is affecting both their personal and professional life. \n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship is partly influenced by the friend's ungratefulness and toxic behavior. The author is also dealing with personal medical issues and depression, which might have affected their ability to maintain the friendship. However, the author tried to support their friend as much as possible, even defending them at work.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship. The author's actions (helping the friend, defending her) seem reasonable. The friend's actions (spreading lies, resentment, undermining the author) are the problematic ones. The author is justified in wanting to distance themselves from a toxic relationship, especially when the friend's behavior is harmful and ungrateful. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has done their part to support the friend, and the friend's actions are the main issue here.\n"
