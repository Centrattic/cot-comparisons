I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to end the friendship with her friend. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to consider all the points.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family, and her friend doesn't. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, and even a new car from the author's parents. The author mentions that her life has been easier academically and financially, graduating debt-free and moving out at 18. The friend is still living with her parents at 26, has $50k in debt, and couldn't find a good job. The author offered her a room in her place, but the friend declined because of the dog the author is allergic to.\n\nThen there's the work situation. The friend works in the family business's warehouse, a job the author's parents paid twice the market rate for. However, the friend is making a lot of mistakes, and the author is defending her. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, even though the author's delays are only 30 minutes. The friend has become resentful, called the author a spoiled attention-seeker, and told the boyfriend she's a leach. The author is now considering cutting ties, knowing that would lead to her parents firing the friend because she can't handle the job anymore.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The author has been supportive, offering help like the room and job. The friend, on the other hand, is not only underperforming at work but also spreading negative comments and being dishonest about the author's circumstances. The author is dealing with medical and depression issues, which affect her work performance slightly. The friend is taking it out on her, which seems unfair.\n\nThe author wants to end the friendship because the friend is toxic. The friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors, being resentful, and pretending to be nice\u2014indicate a lack of genuine friendship. The author isn't at fault for setting boundaries, especially when the friend is ungrateful and hostile. The friend's behavior is more malicious, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to distance herself. The answer should be B (No).\n"
