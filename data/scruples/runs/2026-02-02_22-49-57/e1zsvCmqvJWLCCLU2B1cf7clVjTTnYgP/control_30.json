I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship with their friend. The situation is complex with multiple layers.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family and their friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations and even received a car, which might set up some expectations. The friend is in debt, can't move out, and had a job offered by the author's parents. But their relationship has deteriorated after starting work together. The friend is now blaming the author for work mistakes and spreading negative things about them. The author feels the friend is being ungrateful and is considering cutting ties, knowing it could lead to the friend losing her job if the parents stop supporting her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has tried to help\u2014offered a job, financial support, even a place to stay. But the friend's behavior is toxic, spreading rumors and being resentful. The author is also dealing with personal issues and has depression, which might affect their ability to maintain the friendship. The friend's actions (talking behind their back, blaming the author) are definitely problematic. The author's decision to end the friendship isn't just about the friend's issues but also the negative impact on their own well-being. However, there's a potential consequence for the friend if the author stops being friends, which complicates things. But the author isn't forcing their parents to fire her; they're just ending a friendship. The friend's actions seem to be the root of the problem here. The author isn't obligated to continue a friendship that's harmful. So, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
