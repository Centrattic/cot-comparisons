I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the friend comes from a less privileged background, has been given opportunities by the author's family (car, vacations, job), but the job isn't working out. The friend is making mistakes, getting frustrated, and now she's blaming the author's supposed slowness. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which probably affects their work efficiency. The friend is being toxic, spreading rumors, and being fake nice. \n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing that their parents might fire her if the relationship ends. The key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's actions. The author tried to help by offering a job, which the friend accepted, but then the friend's attitude turned negative. The author is also facing personal challenges, which might have made them less available as a friend.\n\nI need to assess if the author is at fault. The friend's resentment and betrayal are significant. The author isn't forcing the friendship; they're ending it because of the friend's actions. The author isn't making the friend work there\u2014she chose the job. The author's support was generous, but the friend's response is toxic. The author's decision to stop being friends isn't malicious; they're protecting their own well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions justify the end of the friendship, and the author isn't responsible for the friend's choices after being given opportunities.\n"
