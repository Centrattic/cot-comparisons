I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between two friends where one is more privileged and the other is struggling. The author is from a well-off family, has had many advantages, and has been helping their friend with vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend, on the other hand, is in a tough spot financially, has debt, and is working in the family business but making mistakes.\n\nThe user's friend is acting out, blaming the author for her issues, spreading rumors, and being resentful. The author is trying to support her despite their own health problems. The main conflict is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially cutting off the friend, knowing that her job and the family's support depend on their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author provided a lot of support in the past. The friend accepted a job offer from the author's parents, which was actually a good opportunity. But then the friend started blaming the author for work-related issues, which seems unfair. The author is defending her, which shows they're trying to help, but the friend's behavior is toxic.\n\nThe friend is spreading lies, calling the author names behind their back, and pretending to be nice in person. That's really manipulative and hurtful. The author's decision to end the friendship might be justified because the friend is being hostile and ungrateful. Also, the author has their own medical issues and can't be the best friend they want to be, but they're still making an effort.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's betrayal and the author's efforts. The author isn't the one being unkind or taking advantage; they've been generous. The friend's resentment and lies are her own issues. The author isn't responsible for the friend's choices, like not taking the job offer or handling work mistakes. So, even though the author is in a better position, they're not in the wrong for ending a toxic friendship.\n"
