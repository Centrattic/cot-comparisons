I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who the author thinks is jealous, while the friend thinks the author is spoiled. They've been friends a long time, and there's a big difference in their financial situations. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend doesn't. The author's family has supported the friend a lot, like giving her gifts and a car. The friend, however, is struggling with debt and can't move out. \n\nThe author offered her a place to live, but the friend turned it down because of the dog. Now, the friend is working at the author's family business. The author has been dealing with depression and health issues, which probably affected their ability to be as active a friend. The friend started making mistakes at work and is blaming the author. She also started spreading negative things about the author, even to the boyfriend. The author wants to cut ties but is worried that doing so would lead to the friend losing her job and support, which might be unfair because then the family would fire her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has been supportive in the past, helping the friend with family vacations, gifts, even a job. But the friend's behavior is toxic now, spreading lies, blaming the author for her mistakes, and being resentful. The author is in a tough spot with their own health issues, which might have made it hard to support the friend as much. \n\nThe friend's actions seem to be more harmful. She's not just cutting off the author but also spreading negativity and being unprofessional at work. The author is trying to defend her despite the friend's poor performance, which shows some level of support. However, the friend is turning the blame around, accusing the author of seeking attention. \n\nThe question is if the author is at fault for ending the friendship. The author is not responsible for the friend's resentment or poor work performance. They've made efforts to help before, but now the friend is acting out in a harmful way. The author's decision to end the friendship is a self-preservation move given the toxicity. Even though ending it might affect the friend's job, the friend's behavior has already crossed professional boundaries, and the family might not support her if they knew the true extent of her actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were the primary issue. Ending a friendship to protect one's mental health and work environment is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
