I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a long-term friendship where there's a significant difference in their life circumstances. The author comes from a wealthy family, has had an easier life, and works in the family business. Their friend, who is less fortunate, has become resentful and started spreading negative things about the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friend has been given opportunities\u2014family vacations, gifts, a car, a job at the family business. The author tried to help the friend move out by offering a room, but the friend declined due to her dog. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their work performance. The friend is making mistakes at work and now blames the author for not getting orders processed quickly enough. The friend is spreading lies to the author's parents and boyfriend, calling the author spoiled and a leech, all while pretending to be nice to their face.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing that their parents might then fire her since they've been lenient because she's family. The question is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship despite the friend's possible unhappiness.\n\nI should think about the responsibilities each party has. The author has been supportive, offering a job and a place to live. The friend's response is resentment and blame, which seems unjustified, especially if the author's delays are minimal. The friend's actions, like lying and spreading rumors, are clearly harmful. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially if the friend is toxic and undermining their health and personal life.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is an employee now might complicate things, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end a friendship that's deteriorating because of the friend's behavior. The author's parents can make their own decisions about employment, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship with someone who's acting this way. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
