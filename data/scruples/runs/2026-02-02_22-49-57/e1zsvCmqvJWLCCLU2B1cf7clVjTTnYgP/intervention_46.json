I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So the author has a friend who's been treated pretty well by the author's family, including vacations, gifts, even a car. The author comes from a wealthy family, and they've been friends for a long time. The friend is struggling with school debt, still living at home, and now working in the author's family's warehouse business.\n\nThe author mentions that the friend started acting resentful, blaming the author for work mistakes, and spreading negative things behind their back. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might be affecting their ability to manage work tasks as quickly as before. The friend is making errors at work, which the author's parents are frustrated about, but the author tries to defend her. However, the friend is now accusing the author of being spoiled and a leech, and spreading that to others.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that without their support, the friend might lose her job. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the author's family has already given the friend a lot of support, including a job that pays well. The friend's resentment might stem from feeling that the author has an easy life and is getting away with things, while she struggles. The friend's behavior, like lying to the parents and boyfriend, is definitely crossing a line. The author tried to be a supportive friend, even offering a place to live, but the friend rejected it due to her dog. The author's medical issues are also a factor here\u2014maybe they're not as available as before, leading to tension.\n\nThe friend's actions are clearly toxic. Spreading rumors and being nice to your face but cruel behind your back is not acceptable. The author is in a difficult position, balancing their health issues with managing work and the friendship. They tried to help, but now the friend is ungrateful and hostile. The author's decision to end the friendship isn't out of malice but because the friend's behavior is unbearable. Also, the author is concerned about the friend losing her job if they end the friendship, but that's a consequence of the friend's actions, not the author's. The author isn't responsible for the friend's job beyond offering a position they were willing to give initially.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author has done a lot to support the friend, but the friend's actions are harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties, especially since they've already tried to be supportive. The friend's resentment and betrayal are the main issues here. The author's health issues are valid and shouldn't be ignored, and they deserve to be in a healthy environment. Ending the friendship is a reasonable response to the friend's behavior.\n"
