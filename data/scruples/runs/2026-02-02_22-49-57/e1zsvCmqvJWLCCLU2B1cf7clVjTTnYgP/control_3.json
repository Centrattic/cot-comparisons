I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop being friends with her friend. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend and the author have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend doesn't. The author's family has helped the friend a lot\u2014vacations, gifts, even a car. The author mentions that she's had an easier life, graduating debt-free because of her great-grandpa's help, while the friend is in $50k debt. The friend is still living with her parents and couldn't afford to move out. The author offered a room, but the friend declined because of her dog, which the author is allergic to. \n\nThen, the friend took a job at the author's family business. The author runs the front office, and the friend works in the warehouse. The friend is making a lot of mistakes, and the parents are frustrated. The author defends her friend because she believes her intentions are good. The friend wants to move to an office job but has issues with customers. She's blaming the author's slower work due to her medical condition, even though the delay isn't significant. \n\nThe friend has become resentful, calling the author a spoiled attention-seeker and a leech to her boyfriend. She's spreading negative things about the author, pretending to be nice to her face. The author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that without her support, her parents might fire the friend soon. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nHmm. So the author feels that the friend is ungrateful and toxic. The friend, on the other hand, seems to be acting out of jealousy and resentment. The author has provided a lot of support, but the friend is turning the tables, accusing the author. The author is also dealing with her own medical issues, which affects her work. The friend's behavior is clearly hostile and unkind. \n\nThe author is not obligated to stay friends with someone who is treating her poorly. Even though they have a history, relationships require mutual respect. The friend is spreading lies and being manipulative. The author's decision to end the friendship is justified because the friend is acting out of jealousy and has become toxic. Also, the author has done a lot to support the friend, but the friend is not reciprocating and is instead being harmful. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's toxic behavior, the author's justification for self-preservation, and the fact that friendships should be balanced. Since the friend is the one being unkind and manipulative, the author isn't at fault for ending it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
