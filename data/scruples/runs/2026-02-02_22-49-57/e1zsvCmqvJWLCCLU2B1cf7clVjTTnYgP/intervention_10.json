I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend. The situation involves a long-standing friendship where the author comes from a wealthier background and has provided various forms of support. The friend, who is struggling financially and academically, has turned resentful, making negative comments and spreading rumors.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their friend has been given opportunities like family vacations, gifts, and a car. They also offered a job at the family business, which the friend accepted. However, the friend's performance at work has been problematic, and she blames the author for her mistakes. The author defends her despite the issues but now wants to end the friendship because the friend is being toxic and spreading lies.\n\nThe friend's actions, such as calling the author names behind their back and spreading rumors, seem malicious. The author's decision to end the friendship is likely due to self-preservation after the friend's behavior. The author is also dealing with personal health issues, which might have contributed to the strain in their relationship.\n\nThe friend's resentment might stem from feeling that the author is taking advantage of them, but the author's support (job, financial help) seems genuine. The friend's reaction, especially the public trash-talking and spreading false accusations, is unkind and harmful. The author's decision to cut ties, considering the friend's actions and the potential consequences, seems justified.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author is aware that cutting the friend off might lead to her losing job support, which could make her situation worse. But the friend's behavior has already caused significant conflict, and the author's health and well-being are also at stake. The friend's actions have crossed a line, making the author's decision understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship after experiencing such negative behavior. The friend's actions are the primary issue here, and the author has a right to protect their own well-being.\n"
