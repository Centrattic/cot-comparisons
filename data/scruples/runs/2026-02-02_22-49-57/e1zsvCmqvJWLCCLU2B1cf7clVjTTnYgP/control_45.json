I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-time friend who has become resentful and started spreading negative things about the author. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, which might lead to the friend losing job support from the author's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend comes from a less privileged background, and the author's family has supported her with vacations, gifts, and even a car. The friend is in debt, has struggled academically, and now works in the author's family business. The friend's job performance is poor, and she is blaming the author for her mistakes. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their work pace, but they argue it's not enough to hinder the friend. The friend has become resentful, made hurtful comments, and is spreading negativity.\n\nThe author is conflicted because ending the friendship might lead to the friend losing her job and support. But the friend's behavior has been toxic, and the author feels justified in cutting ties. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, the author's family provided support to the friend, but that doesn't obligate the author to maintain the friendship if it's harmful. The friend's actions (blaming, spreading rumors) are clearly negative. The author is managing their own health issues and trying to support the friend's intentions, but the friend's behavior is crossing boundaries. The friend's resentment might stem from their different life circumstances, but that doesn't excuse her actions.\n\nThe author isn't obligated to be friends with someone who is toxic. Choosing to end a friendship where there's mutual harm isn't necessarily the author's fault. The friend's actions are more directly harmful, so the author's decision to end it isn't being in the wrong. However, the author should consider the impact on the friend's job, but perhaps that's a separate issue from the friendship. The author isn't responsible for their parents' support decisions post-friendship. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The friend's behavior is the main issue here, and the author is justified in ending the relationship given the circumstances.\n"
