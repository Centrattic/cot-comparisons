I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship with someone who's been acting resentful and spreading rumors. \n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off background and has supported their friend financially, including buying her a car and letting her work in the family business. The friend, on the other hand, has financial struggles, debt, and can't find a good job. The author tried to help by offering a place to live, which the friend declined due to her dog. \n\nNow, at work, the friend is making mistakes, and the author is defending her. The friend is blaming the author's depression for her errors. She's spreading negative things to others, calling the author a leech and a spoiled person. The author is considering cutting off the friendship but is worried about the friend losing her job and the support from the author's parents.\n\nKey points to consider: The friend is acting ungrateful, spreading rumors, and being resentful. The author has been generous and supportive, but the friend's behavior is toxic. The author is ending the friendship due to the friend's actions, not out of spite. The author's medical issues are a valid reason for reduced activity, and the friend is misrepresenting them as attention-seeking. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions seem to be the main issue here. The author isn't being unkind or abandoning the friend without cause. They're responding to the friend's hostile behavior. Even though the author is aware that cutting the friend off might lead to job loss, the friend's actions have already strained the relationship beyond repair. \n\nIn such cases, people have the right to distance themselves from toxic relationships. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being after the friend's harmful actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
