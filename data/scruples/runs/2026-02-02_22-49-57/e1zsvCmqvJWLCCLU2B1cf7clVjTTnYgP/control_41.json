I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a car. The author graduated without debt because their great-grandpa paid for school, while the friend is in $50k of debt. The friend is still living with her parents at 26. The author offered to let her stay with them, but she declined because of a dog the author is allergic to.\n\nNow, the friend works in the author's family business. The author's parents gave her a job in the warehouse paying more than they expected. But the friend is making mistakes and blaming the author for delays, which the author says are due to their medical issues. The friend started acting resentful, calling the author a spoiled attention-seeker and spreading negative things to others, even pretending to be nice to the author's face.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that if they do, the friend might lose her job with the family business. The parents might not support her anymore, leading to her possible firing. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's resentment and betrayal, the author's attempts to help (offering a job, room, etc.), the friend's unprofessional behavior and spreading rumors, and the author's decision to end the friendship despite potential consequences for the friend.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, maybe she feels overshadowed or taken advantage of. But the author helped her in multiple ways, including employment. The friend's actions (backstabbing, spreading lies) seem more like the issue. The author is justified in feeling hurt and wanting to end the friendship, especially after the friend's toxic behavior. However, the author might feel conflicted because of past support, but the friend's actions have crossed personal and professional boundaries.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's behavior is the main problem here. The author has tried to defend her at work, but the friend isn't improving and is instead turning against the author. The author has the right to protect their own mental health and personal relationships, especially when dealing with their own medical issues. The potential fallout for the friend is a consequence of her actions, not the author's intention to harm her. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
