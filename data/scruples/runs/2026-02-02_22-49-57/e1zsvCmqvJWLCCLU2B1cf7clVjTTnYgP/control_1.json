I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been friends for a long time. The author comes from a well-off family, and the friend isn't as financially stable. The friend has been part of family vacations, received gifts, and even a car from the author's parents. The author mentions that their life has been easier in terms of education and work, while the friend has had to struggle more. The friend is in debt, still lives with her parents, and turned down the author's offer to live with her because of allergies related to her dog.\n\nNow, the friend works in the author's family's warehouse, which was a job offered by the author's parents. The friend has been making mistakes at work, and the author has been defending her. The friend is starting to blame the author for her work issues, even though the author has a medical condition that slightly affects their work efficiency. The friend has become resentful and has been spreading negative things about the author behind their back, even to the author's boyfriend. The author is done with the friendship and considering ending it, knowing that their parents might fire the friend if the friendship ends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: long-term friendship, economic disparities, work performance issues, personal attacks from the friend, and the author's decision to end the friendship. \n\nThe author is questioning if they're at fault. Let's look at both sides. The friend is in a tough spot financially, and the author's family has supported her. But the friend is now acting out, spreading rumors, and being resentful. The author is trying to defend her at work but is also dealing with their own health issues. When someone starts to actively harm another person's reputation and relationships, that's a red flag. The friend's actions seem to be crossing boundaries beyond just being upset about their own situation.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily to blame for the friend's behavior. The friend is in a position where she has received support but is now reacting negatively instead of addressing her own challenges. The author has tried to help (offering a job, defending her at work) but the friend's response is toxic. The author's decision to end the friendship is a response to the friend's actions, not the root cause. \n\nAlso, considering that the author has a medical condition and is managing work, they've been doing their best. The friend's accusations and rumors are unfounded and harmful. The author is not obligated to maintain a friendship that's toxic and damaging. While the author is aware that ending the friendship might affect the friend's job, that's a consequence of the friend's actions, not the author's fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the friend's behavior is the main issue here. The author has been supportive and tried to help, but the friend's resentment and actions have made the situation untenable. The author is not in the wrong for ending a friendship that's causing them harm.\n"
