I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong given their situation with a friend. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author has a long-time friend who comes from a less financially stable background. The author's family is well-off, and they've provided the friend with vacations, gifts, and even a car. The friend has struggled academically and financially, ending up in debt. The author offered her a room to live in, but she declined due to her dog. Now, the friend works in the author's family business's warehouse, where she's making mistakes. The author is defending her because her intentions are good, but the friend is blaming the author for her errors and spreading rumors that the author is spoiled. The friend is also being passive-aggressive, telling others the author is a leech. The author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing their parents might then fire her, but feels justified because of the friend's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author has been supportive financially, but the friend is resentful and ungrateful. The friend's actions\u2014spreading lies, being dishonest at work, and turning on the author\u2014seem to indicate a shift in the friendship. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which is affecting their work performance slightly, but the friend is blaming them for her own mistakes. That's a key point. The friend's resentment might stem from jealousy of the author's privileges, but that doesn't excuse her negative behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend. The author's reasons are the friend's unkind actions and the realization that the friendship is toxic. The friend's actions have crossed boundaries by spreading rumors and being untruthful about the author. The author is also protecting their own well-being, which is understandable, especially with their health issues.\n\nHowever, the author's family has been supporting the friend financially, and the author is aware that cutting ties might lead to the friend losing her job. But the author is not the one who gave the job; it was the parents. The author's role is as a friend and coworker, and their job is to defend the friend despite her mistakes. However, the friend's behavior has become toxic and harmful. The author is justified in distancing themselves from someone who is spreading lies and being unkind. The author isn't responsible for the friend's financial situation once they stop being friends, and the friend's actions have likely contributed to her own potential job loss.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the root issue, and the author is making a decision to protect their mental health and relationships. The answer should be B (No).\n"
