I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend who now works in the author's family business. The friend is struggling financially and academically, while the author comes from a wealthier background. The friend has been given opportunities by the author's parents, like a car and family vacations. The author offered her a place to stay but she declined due to her dog. Now, working in the warehouse, she's making mistakes and blaming the author. She's spreading negative things about the author, calling her a leech and a spoiled bitch. The author is dealing with depression and health issues, which might affect her work performance. The friend is resentful and spreading rumors. The author wants to cut ties, knowing that her parents might fire her if they stop supporting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's resentment and betrayal, the author's efforts to defend her, and the friend's toxic behavior. The author is in a vulnerable position with serious health issues, which the friend is taking advantage of. The friend's actions have led to a breakdown in their friendship and the work environment. The author isn't taking advantage of the friend; instead, the friend is exploiting the author's position and opportunities given by the family.\n\nThe author is considering cutting ties, which could lead to the friend losing her job. But the author isn't responsible for the friend's job security; that's on the employer (the author's parents). The friend's actions are unprofessional and harmful. The author has a right to protect herself from the friend's negativity and lies, especially when it's affecting her well-being and work. The friend's resentment and accusations are unfounded, so the author isn't in the wrong for distancing herself. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
