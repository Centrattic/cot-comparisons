I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault (AITA) or not. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, so I need to evaluate based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author and their friend have been close since they were kids. The author comes from a wealthy family, while the friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, and even a new car from the author's parents. The author mentions that their life has been easier\u2014graduated debt-free, moved out at 18, works in the family business. The friend struggled in school, has significant debt, and lives with her parents at 26. The friend turned down an offer to live with the author due to allergies related to her dog. \n\nIn the workplace, the friend is making a lot of mistakes in the warehouse. The author defends her, even though she's not performing well. The friend blames the author for her mistakes and accuses them of being depressed for attention. She also spreads negative things about the author to others, including calling the author a leech in front of the boyfriend. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that if they do, the friend will lose the job and other support from the author's parents.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's behavior. She's being hostile, spreading rumors, and not taking responsibility for her mistakes. The author is in a better financial position but has tried to help in the past (offering a job, housing). The friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy or frustration over their differing circumstances. The author is dealing with medical issues and has been less active as a friend, which the friend is using to attack them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a better life or trying to defend the friend initially. The friend's actions are clearly negative\u2014being unkind, spreading lies, not performing well at work. The author's decision to stop the friendship is a personal choice, especially given the friend's toxic behavior. The author is also aware that this might lead to the friend losing her job, but the author isn't responsible for the friend's job performance. The friend's job is with the parents, not the author, so the author isn't directly causing her to be fired; that's more up to the parents based on her work.\n\nThe author's main wrongdoing could be if they were being intentionally cruel or exploitative, but there's no indication of that. They've helped the friend financially, offered a job, and defended her at work. The friend's actions are the problematic ones here. The author has the right to cut off someone who is being hostile and spreading harmful rumors. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n"
