I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for considering cutting off a friend who has become resentful and hostile. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the friend comes from a less privileged background and has had a harder time academically and financially. The author's family has supported her with vacations, gifts, and even a car. The author also offered her a job in the family business, which the friend accepted. However, the friend now works in the warehouse and is making mistakes, blaming the author's depression for her issues. The friend has become resentful, spreading negative things about the author, and the author wants to end the friendship, knowing that might affect her job since the family business is involved.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's actions: spreading negativity, being disloyal, and acting out of jealousy. The author has been trying to support her, even defending her at work despite her mistakes. The friend, on the other hand, is not being truthful, as the author has medical issues and is genuine in her support. The friend's behavior seems to stem from insecurity and resentment towards the author's advantages.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend, which could lead to the friend losing her job. But given that the friend has been acting out and being unappreciative, the author might feel justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off despite knowing the consequences.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't necessarily at fault here. The friend's actions are manipulative and harmful. The author hasn't done anything to deserve the treatment she's receiving. However, the author's decision to end the friendship could have repercussions on the friend's employment, which might be a point of contention. But the friend's behavior has deteriorated the relationship, and the author has the right to protect her own well-being and mental health.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for ending a toxic friendship where the friend has been acting out of jealousy and resentment, despite the potential fallout.\n"
