I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship with her friend after a series of conflicts.\n\nFirst, the friend is in a tough spot financially and has her own struggles. The author has been supportive by including her in family vacations, giving gifts, and even buying her a car. But the friend is now resentful, spreading negative comments, and turning on the author when things go wrong at work.\n\nThe author has a valid reason to feel hurt, especially after being blamed for things she's not responsible for. The friend's actions\u2014like calling her a leech and a spoiled brat\u2014are pretty harsh. The author is also dealing with personal medical issues and depression, which makes it hard for her to be there as a friend, but she's still trying her best.\n\nThe key point is that the friend is projecting her own frustrations onto the author. The friend is in an unstable job and is making mistakes, which the author is trying to defend her for. But the friend is blaming the author for her own shortcomings. That's not fair. The author shouldn't be held responsible for the friend's job performance.\n\nAlso, the author is considering cutting off the friend because she doesn't want to be around someone who's so negative and dishonest. Even though the friend might lose her job, the author's well-being is important. It's her right to end a friendship that's toxic.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to maintain a friendship despite her own challenges and the friend's unkind behavior. The friend is the one acting out of jealousy and resentment, not the author. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
