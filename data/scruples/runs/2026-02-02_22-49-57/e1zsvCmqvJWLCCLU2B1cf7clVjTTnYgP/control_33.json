I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between the author and their lifelong friend. The friend seems to be struggling financially and with her job, and the author comes from a wealthier background. The author has supported the friend in various ways\u2014vacations, gifts, even a car. They offered to let her live with them, but she declined because of her dog. Now the friend is working in the family business, but making mistakes and the author is defending her. However, the friend is acting resentful, blaming the author for her issues, and spreading negative things about the author behind their back.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they gave a lot of support in the past, including financial help and job opportunities. The friend turned down the offer to live with the author, which the author had to do because of allergies. The author is also dealing with personal and medical issues, which affects their work performance but not to the extent that it's causing the friend's problems. The friend is now being rude and spreading rumors, which the author finds out through others. The author wants to cut ties, knowing that if they do, their parents might fire her, but they still feel justified in ending the friendship.\n\nThe friend's perspective: she's in a tough spot, maybe feeling jealous or envious of the author's privileges. She's making mistakes at work, possibly due to her own struggles, and is lashing out at the author, who she blames for her issues. Her behavior is clearly negative and harmful, even if she's pretending to be nice to the author's face.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties. The author has been supportive, but the friend is acting unkindly and ungrateful. The author is under stress with their own health issues and is doing their best. The friend's resentment and lies are probably the main issues here. The author's decision to end the friendship is based on the friend's toxic behavior, not on their own actions. Even though the author knows it might lead to their parents firing the friend, the friend's actions seem to have contributed to that outcome. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's being harmed by the other person's behavior. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
