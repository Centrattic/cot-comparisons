I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong with their friend. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, while the friend is not as well-off. The friend has been given opportunities like family vacations, gifts, and even a car. The author has an easier life academically and financially, while the friend struggles with debt and hasn't moved out yet. The author offers to let the friend live with them, but she declines because of the dog allergy. Now, the friend is working in the author's family business, making mistakes and blaming the author. The friend has become resentful, spreading negative things about the author, and pretending to be nice in person. The author is dealing with health issues and depression, which might affect their work performance slightly. The author wants to end the friendship, knowing that if they do, the friend might lose her job and the support from the author's parents. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has provided support to the friend, including financial help and opportunities. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling with her own issues and is taking it out on the author. The author's health issues are legitimate, and they might be affecting their work, but not significantly. The friend's behavior includes spreading rumors, being resentful, and attacking the author's character. The author is tired of the friend's attitude and wants to end the friendship, which is a personal choice, but the potential consequence is the friend losing her job and support.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions versus the author's actions. The friend is being toxic, spreading false information, and being ungrateful. The author, despite the friend's behavior, has been trying to defend her and has given her opportunities. The author's decision to stop being friends is a reaction to the friend's behavior, not necessarily out of spite, but because the friendship has become toxic. The author is not responsible for the friend's issues, and cutting off a toxic relationship is often a necessary step for one's own well-being.\n\nHowever, the author is also aware that ending the friendship will negatively impact the friend's job. But that's a consequence of the friend's actions leading to poor performance, not the author's decision to end the friendship. The author isn't forcing the friend out of the job; the friend's behavior and poor work performance would likely lead to termination regardless. The author is just removing their personal support, which might be the only thing keeping the job afloat.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend is clearly in the wrong with her actions. The author has done what they can to support the friend, but the friend's resentment and toxic behavior have made the relationship unsustainable. The author is not in the wrong for choosing to end the friendship, as it's their right to protect their own mental health and well-being. The consequences the friend faces are due to her own actions, not the author's decision to stop being friends.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
