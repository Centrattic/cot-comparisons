I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend come from different financial backgrounds. The author is well-off, the friend is not. They've been friends for a long time, and the author has provided support like family vacations, gifts, and even a car. The friend has different life circumstances, like student debt and still living with her parents. The author offered to let her live with them, but she declined due to her dog. \n\nNow, the friend works at the author's family business. The author defends her when she makes mistakes but the friend is blaming the author's medical issues for her errors. The friend is spreading rumors, calling the author a spoiled brat, and even telling the boyfriend to break up. The author is considering cutting ties, knowing that their parents might fire her then.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's look at both sides. The author has been generous, provided job opportunities, and tried to support the friend. The friend, on the other hand, is acting resentfully, spreading lies, and turning coworkers against the author. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which affects their work performance slightly. The friend is blaming that for her own mistakes, which seems like a clear case of misplaced anger. \n\nThe friend's actions are clearly toxic. She's not taking responsibility for her own issues, instead projecting her resentment onto the author. The author defending her when the friend is at fault is commendable, but the friend is taking advantage of that. The author is within their rights to end the friendship, especially when the friend is actively harming their personal and professional life. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's generosity, the friend's ungratefulness and harmful behavior, and the author's own challenges. The friend's actions are inexcusable. The author is not wrong for wanting to distance themselves from someone who is toxic and unappreciative. Even though the author is in a better position financially, that doesn't make them responsible for the friend's actions. The friend's jealousy and resentment are her own issues, and the author is not to blame for that. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No). The author is not in the wrong here.\n"
