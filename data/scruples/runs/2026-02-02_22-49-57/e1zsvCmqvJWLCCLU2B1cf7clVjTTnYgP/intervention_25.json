I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is a complicated friendship where the author comes from a wealthy background, and their friend doesn't. The friend has been given a lot by the author's family, including vacations, gifts, even a car. The author has a successful job in the family business, while the friend is struggling with debt, living at home, and now works in the warehouse.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior. After being employed by the author's parents, the friend started making mistakes, got resentful, and started spreading negative things about the author to the boyfriend and others, pretending to be nice to their face. The author defends the friend at work, even though the friend is making errors. The author is dealing with health issues and depression, which might have affected their ability to support the friend as much as before.\n\nThe friend accuses the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker and even advises the boyfriend to break up. Now the author is considering cutting ties, knowing that their parents might fire the friend if they're not an employee anymore. The question is if the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't done anything wrong by offering help, supporting the friend through various means, and trying to defend them at work despite their mistakes. The friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors, being resentful, and acting nice to the author's face\u2014are clearly problematic. The author is within their rights to end a friendship that has become toxic, especially when the friend's behavior is harmful and manipulative.\n\nThe friend's resentment stems from their own struggles and possibly feelings of jealousy or insecurity. However, that doesn't justify their actions. The author isn't responsible for the friend's misfortunes, and the friend's response is inappropriate. The author's decision to cut ties is a self-protective measure, and the potential consequence of the friend losing a job is a result of the friend's own behavior leading to poor performance at work.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is justified in ending the friendship after the friend's toxic behavior.\n"
