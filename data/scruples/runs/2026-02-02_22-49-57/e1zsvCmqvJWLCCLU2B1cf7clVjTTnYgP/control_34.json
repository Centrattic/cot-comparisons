I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a friend who's been acting out. The author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend doesn't. They've been friends a long time, and the friend has been part of family vacations, even got a car. The author had an easier life, no debt, while the friend is in debt and can't move out. The friend took a job at the author's family business but is struggling and making mistakes. The author defends her, but the friend starts spreading rumors, being mean, and blaming the author for her issues. Now the author wants to cut ties, but is concerned about the friend losing her job and support.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they offered the friend a job, even paying more. They tried to help with housing. The friend's response is being resentful, spreading lies, and being toxic. The author wants to stop being friends because of the friend's behavior. The question is if the author is in the wrong for cutting ties.\n\nThe friend's behavior seems toxic. Spreading rumors, being mean, and pretending to be nice. The author has given her opportunities and support. The friend's jealousy might be a factor. The author's medical issues are real, and the friend is blaming them for work mistakes. The author's right to distance themselves from a toxic person is important. The friend is causing harm, both to the author and others. The fact that the author is still supporting the friend at work but not personally is key. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship due to the friend's actions. So answer is B.\n"
