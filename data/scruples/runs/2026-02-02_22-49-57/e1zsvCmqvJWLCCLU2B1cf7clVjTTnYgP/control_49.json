I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two friends where one is more well-off than the other. The author comes from a wealthy family, has had an easy time with school, and now works in their family's business. Their friend, who is less fortunate, has been getting support from the author's family, like vacations and a car. Now that the friend works in the warehouse, their relationship has deteriorated.\n\nFirst, the author is defending their friend at work, even when the friend makes mistakes. The friend is blaming the author's depression for her issues and spreading negative things about her. The author wants to cut off the friendship, knowing that this might lead to the friend losing her job if their parents stop supporting her. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nThe friend's behavior seems pretty toxic. She's spreading lies, being resentful, and acting nice to the author's face but trash-talking behind her back. The author has been trying to support her even when it's hard because of their own medical issues. The author is also allergic to the friend's dog, which is a valid reason the friend can't move in. The author's parents offered her a job, and she's struggling at work, making costly mistakes. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but they're not the one acting out. The friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy of the author's privileges, but that's no excuse for her behavior. The author is not obligated to continue a friendship where they're being treated poorly. Even if cutting off the friend would affect her job, the friend's actions (like lying and spreading rumors) might make the author feel justified in ending the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author has been supportive and tried to help, but the friend's toxic behavior is leading to the breakdown. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
