I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their friend. So first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe author and their friend have been close for a long time, but there's a big difference in their financial situations. The author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend doesn't. The author has provided the friend with many gifts, family vacations, even a car. The friend is struggling with debt, still living at home, and can't find a good job. The author offered her a place to live but she refused because of her dog and allergies.\n\nNow, the friend is working in the author's family business. The author defends her at work despite her mistakes, but the friend is blaming the author for her issues. The friend is spreading rumors about the author, calling them names behind their back, and being nice to their face. The author is tired of this and wants to cut ties, but they know their parents might fire her if they do. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend is clearly acting resentful and toxic, spreading lies and being two-faced. That's not okay. The author, on the other hand, is in a privileged position and has been supportive in the past. But the friend's behavior is crossing lines, and the author is justified in wanting to end the friendship.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the author do something to cause the friend's resentment? The friend was given a job at a higher wage than others, which the author defended her. However, the friend's mistakes are her own responsibility. The author's medical issues and slower work pace aren't the main cause here. The friend is blaming them unfairly.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions\u2014telling lies about the author, being a backstabber\u2014are toxic. The author is trying to manage their health and work, which is valid. Ending a friendship with someone who is actively spreading negativity isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the other person is being malicious.\n\nThe key points are the friend's toxic behavior versus the author's reasonable reactions. The author isn't doing anything to deserve the friend's treatment. They are trying to support her but she's ungrateful and hostile. The author has the right to distance themselves from someone who is harmful, even if they were once close. The fear of their parents firing the friend might be a consequence, but the author isn't responsible for the friend's job stability beyond what they've already done (like offering the job and defending her).\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to end a friendship that's causing them harm. The friend's actions are the problem here, not the author's decision to cut ties.\n"
