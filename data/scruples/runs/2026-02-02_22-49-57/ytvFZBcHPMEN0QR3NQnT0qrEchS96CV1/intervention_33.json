He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a crush who is trans and the author's change in attraction after discovering this, leading to a break-up and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author started developing feelings for someone they had been friends with. They became close, engaging in romantic activities. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until a moment when the author was about to have sex. The author feels lied to because the information was withheld for months. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they no longer want to pursue a relationship. The trans person is upset and has accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling that the trans person didn't disclose important information in a timely manner, which affected their decision. The question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nI should think about the ethical aspects here. Was there a lack of honesty from the trans person? If the trans person didn't disclose their identity early on, maybe during the friendship phase, the author had a right to feel misled. But sometimes people might not disclose such personal details early unless they feel it's necessary or appropriate. However, in a romantic context, certain details are important for both parties to know.\n\nThe author's reaction: they were honest about their preferences. If the trans person was undergoing transition or had other reasons for not disclosing earlier, that's a factor. But the author isn't being cruel; they're stating their feelings. The trans person's anger and accusations might be due to hurt feelings, but the author isn't at fault for not changing their preferences.\n\nThe author wants to remain friends but the trans person is upset. The author isn't the one who initiated the conflict; they're responding to the situation as it unfolded. The key here is whether the trans person's disclosure timing was appropriate. If they waited until a sexual moment, that's a breach of trust. The author isn't wrong for feeling that way.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their feelings and preferences. The trans person's actions of not disclosing earlier may have led to the conflict, but the author's response is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
