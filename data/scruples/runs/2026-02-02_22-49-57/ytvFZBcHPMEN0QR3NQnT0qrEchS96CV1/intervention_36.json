He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a romantic relationship where one person is transgender, and the other discovers this just before having sex, then loses interest. The author is feeling guilty and is being criticized by their ex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, then the relationship became romantic. The author found out the person is trans when they noticed there's no penis. The author isn't attracted to vaginas and felt lied to because the other didn't disclose earlier. The other person is upset and called the author names. The author is now confused about whether they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about honesty in relationships and how personal boundaries play into that. The trans person might have chosen when to come out, maybe waiting until they felt the relationship was solid. But the author felt that trans person didn't disclose something important early enough, leading to a loss of attraction.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of the relationship. Both people were getting to know each other over months. The trans person might have been cautious about coming out earlier due to fear of rejection or discrimination. On the other hand, the author needed that information to make an informed choice about the relationship. If the trans person waited until the point of intimacy to reveal this, it's understandable why the author feels misled, even if there were good intentions.\n\nBut attractiveness is subjective and personal. The author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their preference, and they have the right to be honest about it. However, the trans person might have hoped that the emotional connection would override physical preferences. The author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship\u2014might be seen as a natural consequence of their preferences, not necessarily being in the wrong.\n\nThe other person's anger and calling the author names complicates things. It's possible they felt betrayed and hurt, but responding with accusations of being evil and manipulative is extreme. The author didn't lie or deceive; they acted based on their feelings and preferences. The trans person might have a valid reason for not disclosing earlier, but that doesn't make the author's response wrong. The author is not obligated to maintain a relationship if their fundamental preferences aren't met.\n\nSo, the key here is whether withholding information about gender identity constitutes a lie. If the trans person didn't feel safe coming out yet, it's their personal choice, but it's also a matter of when they chose to share. The author's reaction is a personal choice based on their preferences. Since the author didn't know beforehand, they can't be blamed for not being attracted. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
