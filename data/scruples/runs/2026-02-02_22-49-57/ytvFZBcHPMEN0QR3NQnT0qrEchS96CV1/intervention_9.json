He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. The author met a guy at art school, they became friends, started dating, and then during a sexual encounter, the author discovered the guy is trans. The author then stopped the interaction and the guy is upset. The author feels they were lied to because the guy didn't disclose his trans identity earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't attracted to trans women, which is their personal preference. They mention they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The guy didn't disclose his identity until the moment, which the author feels was a lie. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of this.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, everyone has the right to their sexual preferences. The guy, as a trans person, might have felt pressured to disclose earlier, but the author is allowed to have boundaries. However, there's a nuance here. The author and the guy were in a dating relationship, and the author might have had the right to know earlier if they wanted to continue. But the guy might have been waiting for the right time or felt it was a personal matter to share when comfortable. \n\nThe key issue is consent and disclosure. If the guy was upfront about his identity at the start of the relationship, the author could have decided whether they wanted to pursue it. But since it was revealed during a sexual act, that might be why the author feels lied to. However, the author's reaction is based on personal preference, not on any deception about his identity. The guy might have considered himself a man, so the author's surprise is understandable but not the guy's fault. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their attraction. It's their right to choose who they're attracted to. The guy's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't being manipulative. The answer is B.\n"
