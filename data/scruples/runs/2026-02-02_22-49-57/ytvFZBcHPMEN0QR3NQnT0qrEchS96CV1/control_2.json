He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. The situation is that they were dating, got close, and during a moment of intimacy, the author discovered the person is trans. The author then stopped the interaction and wants to stay friends but not pursue a relationship anymore. The other person is upset and accused the author of being evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The author felt lied to because they believe that information is crucial for their attraction. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. \n\nLegally and ethically, being trans is a part of someone's identity, but when and how to disclose it can be a personal choice. The author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation\u2014strictly straight, not attracted to vaginas. The other person might have felt that the author was only interested in a penis, hence the frustration when the author doesn't want to continue. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious. They're stating their preferences and boundaries. While it's possible the trans person might have wanted to share this earlier, the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship if their attraction isn't there. The other person's accusations of being manipulative or evil seem unjust, as the author is being honest about their feelings now. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship when their attraction is based on specific physical attributes. The trans person's decision to not disclose earlier might be a separate issue, but the author isn't at fault for their reaction.\n"
