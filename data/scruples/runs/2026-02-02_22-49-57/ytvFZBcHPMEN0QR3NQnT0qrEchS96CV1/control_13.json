He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was dating someone who is transgender, and when they found out the person is trans, their attraction disappeared. Now, the other person is upset and accusing them of being evil and manipulative. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author met a guy, thought he was male, developed a relationship, and then found out he's trans. The author realizes their attraction is only to men, not women, so they can't continue the relationship. The person is upset because they feel the author ended things after getting close.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The person didn't disclose being trans until the moment of intimacy. The author argues that this information was important and should have been shared earlier. But is it the author's fault that they found out at that point? Also, the author isn't being offensive but is stating their sexual orientation. They still want to remain friends, which shows they care about the person's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might feel hurt because they were honest eventually, but maybe the author could have been more understanding. But the author didn't know until that point. The author's reaction is based on their genuine feelings and orientation. They aren't pretending to be straight; they're acknowledging their attraction to men. So, they're not in the wrong for their feelings. \n\nThe person's anger and accusations might be more about their own feelings of rejection and not about the author's right to have those boundaries. The author isn't manipulating; they\u2019re being honest about their feelings once they have the information. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
