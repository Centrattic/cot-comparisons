He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and subsequently losing attraction, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and then started dating. They had a physical relationship that was progressing towards having sex when the author discovered the person was trans. The author felt misled because the person didn't disclose this earlier and now doesn't want to continue the relationship. The trans person is upset, calling the author names like \"evil and manipulative.\"\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity upfront. Depending on cultural and personal contexts, when and how to share such information can vary. However, the author's reaction is based on attraction being tied to their strict straight identity. The author isn't choosing to end the relationship out of malice but because they aren't attracted anymore after the discovery. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't lying or manipulating. They're being honest about their feelings now. The trans person might have felt comfortable sharing their identity when they did, maybe after the relationship had progressed. But the author's change in attraction is a personal choice, not a malicious act. The trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or misunderstood. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is at fault. The author isn't hiding their sexuality or making false claims. They're choosing their preference, which is valid. The trans person had the right to be who they are, but if they didn't disclose earlier, that could be a point of contention. However, the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if their attraction is gone. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a personal decision based on their feelings and preferences, even if it's painful for the other person. The trans person's reaction is more about feeling rejected than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
