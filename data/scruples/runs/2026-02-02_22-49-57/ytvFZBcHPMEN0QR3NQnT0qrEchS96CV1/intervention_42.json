He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author realizing their crush is transgender and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. The author feels they were lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans status earlier. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and the trans person were in a relationship, or at least dating, but the author didn't know the person was trans. The author didn't feel attracted anymore after finding out. The trans person is upset about the breakup and made some harsh accusations. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nTransgender people often face the decision of when to disclose their gender identity. If the trans person didn't disclose earlier, maybe they were waiting until the relationship was more serious. On the other hand, the author might not have considered that the trans person had the right to privacy regarding their body. The author's lack of attraction could be due to being straight, which is a valid sexual orientation. However, the author might be conflating the person's identity with their anatomy. \n\nIt's important to note that transitioning is a personal journey, and some trans people may not want to discuss their bodies, especially in the context of intimacy. The author approached the situation in a way that could be seen as violating the trans person's boundaries by trying to go further physically before that disclosure. The author's reaction might also stem from not understanding that the trans person's identity is valid regardless of their anatomy. \n\nBut the author is also being honest about their feelings. They can't be expected to be attracted to someone if they aren't, especially if they identify as straight. The trans person's anger and accusations might be more about their own feelings of rejection rather than the author's actions. However, the author didn't explicitly ask about the person's gender identity before engaging in physical intimacy, which could be a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans, especially if that's part of their identity. However, the way the situation unfolded might have been handled differently. The author could have communicated their feelings more sensitively, but the core issue is about personal preferences and honesty. The trans person's choice to not disclose earlier might have set up expectations that were unrealistic for the author. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are being honest about their feelings and sexual orientation. The trans person's reactions might stem from their own pain but don't necessarily make the author an asshole. The answer should be B (No).\n"
