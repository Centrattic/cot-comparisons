He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The situation involves a crush who is transgender, and the author became less attracted after discovering this during a romantic encounter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their crush were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and things were escalating to sex. The author found out the person was trans during a moment of intimacy. The person didn't disclose this earlier, and now the author is no longer interested romantically, which upset the other person. \n\nThe main question is about whether the author is in the wrong for ending the romantic relationship after finding out their partner is trans. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, which makes me think they are attracted to men based on their assigned gender. But since the trans person's gender identity is female, the author is not attracted to them. \n\nNow, considering the disclosure. The person didn't mention their gender identity during the months of friendship and dating. In relationships, especially romantic ones, people typically share important personal information. However, the timing of the disclosure is crucial. If it's not mentioned at all and then revealed during a sexual encounter, that might be seen as a problem. \n\nBut the author's reaction is based on their attraction. They mention that if the person had told them earlier, maybe they could have worked through it. However, they now feel lied to because the information wasn't shared before intimacy. The other person is upset and accused the author of faking the friendship, which seems harsh. \n\nTransgender people often face the decision of when to come out, especially in dating. Some might do it early, others later. It's a personal choice influenced by various factors, like fear of rejection or judgment. The author's problem is that the disclosure came during a sexual moment, which made them feel the person wasn't honest. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong for not continuing the relationship? I think not. If someone isn't attracted to a trans person, even if they were previously friends and had romantic feelings, it's their right to end things if they feel it's not genuine. However, the way the author stopped the interaction might be abrupt. They didn't plan to tell the person before moving forward, which could be a mistake. But the person didn't disclose their trans status either, leading to a situation where the author felt misled. \n\nThe other person's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative seems over the top, suggesting they might be projecting their own feelings of rejection or fear. The author might feel they were in a position where they couldn't have known unless told, but the timing of the disclosure was poor. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the trans person might have a responsibility to share such a significant detail before sexual intimacy. However, the author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious but based on personal attraction. So the author isn't in the wrong for not being interested, but perhaps could have handled the situation more sensitively. The other person's accusations seem to be a defense mechanism. \n\nSo the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
