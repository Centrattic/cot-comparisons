He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The person is a straight individual who found out their crush is trans and lost attraction. The key points here are about attraction, honesty, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their personal preference, and it's valid. But the trans person in question didn't disclose their identity until the moment before a sexual encounter. The author felt lied to because the trans person waited until that point to share such an important detail. \n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is wrong. The author is not rejecting the person because they're trans; they're rejecting the person because of a lack of attraction due to their anatomy. That's a personal preference, not a moral failing. However, they did form a relationship with someone they thought was cisgender, which might have influenced their feelings. \n\nThe trans person's delay in disclosing their identity is a big issue. If they had been honest from the start, the author might have made a different choice. The author is not obligated to continue the relationship if their attraction is gone. The trans person's reaction of being upset and calling the author names is their own response, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not wanting to pursue a romantic relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans. They are in a situation where they had to confront their own biases and make a choice based on their preferences. However, the way they ended things might have been abrupt, but their core reasoning isn't about transphobia but about personal attraction. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
