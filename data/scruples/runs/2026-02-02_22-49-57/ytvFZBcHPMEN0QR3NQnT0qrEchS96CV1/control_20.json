He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation involves a crush who is trans, and the author losing attraction after finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and the trans person were friends, then developed a romantic relationship. The author didn't realize the person was trans until they started to have sex. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. Now, the author is no longer attracted and wants to be friends, but the trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they don't want to continue the relationship. They feel the trans person didn't come out early enough, leading to the awkward situation. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. From a social perspective, attraction is a personal thing, and people have the right to know about important aspects of a partner. However, when it comes to gender identity, especially in a trans person, it's a sensitive issue. The trans person might have felt it was the right time to come out, or perhaps unsure when to disclose. The author didn't know until the intimate moment, which could be seen as a breach of trust if the trans person didn't mention it earlier.\n\nBut the author isn't rejecting the person for being trans; they're stating their sexual orientation. It's valid for someone to realize they're not attracted to a trans person, especially if they identify as straight. The author isn't being discriminatory but is honest about their preferences.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems harsh. Calling the author names and accusing them of faking friendship suggests possible emotional manipulation or deflection. The author is trying to maintain the friendship, which is a reasonable response.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't at fault for their sexual orientation or for ending the relationship after discovering something they find important. They tried to be understanding of the trans person's situation. The trans person might have made a mistake in not disclosing earlier, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending the romance.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their feelings and orientation, and the trans person's anger seems misplaced.\n"
