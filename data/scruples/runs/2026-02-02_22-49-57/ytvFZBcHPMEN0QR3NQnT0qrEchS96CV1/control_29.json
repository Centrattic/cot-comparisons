He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe person went to art school and met a guy they found attractive, funny, and with similar interests. They became good friends, then started dating. During a moment where they were about to have sex, the author discovered that their crush is trans and doesn't have a penis. The author felt lied to because the trans person didn't mention this earlier. The author is straight and doesn't find vaginas attractive. They want to be friends but not continue the relationship, and the trans person is upset and accused the author of being evil. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they were attracted to the person as a male (assuming they presented as male), and upon finding out the person is trans, their attraction faded. They feel the person didn't disclose this important detail in time, which made them uncomfortable. The author wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have felt that they were being genuine and authentic by being themselves. They might have disclosed their gender identity when they felt ready or thought appropriate. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating the trans person's identity, especially if the author didn't consider that the person's gender identity is part of who they are, regardless of the physical aspect.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Disclosure of Gender Identity**: When is it appropriate for someone to disclose their trans status? Is there an expectation that they must mention it immediately? The trans person might not have felt it necessary to bring it up until they were comfortable, especially in the early stages of the relationship. The author might assume that since they were dating, the trans person should have mentioned it before things got physical. However, relationships can vary, and some people might not disclose such information upfront if they haven't been asked or if they feel it's not relevant to the relationship at that stage.\n\n2. **Attraction and Orientation**: The author identifies as straight, so their attraction is to males. However, the trans person's gender identity is male (assuming they transitioned to male), which might mean that they still identify as male. The author's issue is with the physical aspect (penis vs. vagina), but if the trans person is male and presents as male, the author's attraction might be based on gender rather than anatomy. The author's explanation is that they are attracted to penises, which is a different perspective. However, from a trans rights perspective, the person's gender identity is male, so the author's reaction might be seen as focusing on the physical aspect rather than the person's identity.\n\n3. **Emotional Reactions**: The author felt lied to because the information wasn't disclosed earlier. However, the trans person might not have considered that their gender identity needed to be discussed before becoming intimate. The author's decision to stop the relationship could be seen as valid if their orientation is strictly towards males with penises, but the trans person might feel that the author is invalidating their identity by focusing on the physical traits.\n\n4. **Communication and Consent**: The author approached the situation where they were about to have sex and discovered the trans status at that moment. The trans person might not have considered that the author's physical expectations (penis) were important to them. The author might argue that they needed to know this before proceeding, but the trans person could argue that it's not their responsibility to anticipate the author's physical needs or to disclose such information unless asked.\n\n5. **Labeling the Author as an \"Asshole\"**: The trans person called the author evil and manipulative, which is extreme and could indicate their hurt feelings. However, the author is not in the wrong just because the other person reacted negatively. The author's feelings are valid, even if they are hurtful to the trans person. The trans person's anger might be justified if they feel that the author is rejecting them for being trans, but if the author is simply not attracted to a vagina despite the trans person's male identity, it's a matter of personal preference.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's situation is complex. From a trans rights perspective, it's important to recognize that gender identity is a core part of a person, and the trans person's identity as male should be respected. However, the author's attraction is based on physical attributes, which are beyond identity. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina, but they might be in a situation where their attraction doesn't align with the trans person's identity. The ethical question is whether the author is wrong for not overcoming their attraction based on physical traits. However, people can't be forced to change their attractions, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship where their primary attraction isn't present.\n\nAdditionally, the trans person might be in the wrong for not disclosing their status earlier, but disclosure isn't always straightforward. People often disclose personal information when they feel safe or when it's relevant. It's not necessarily the case that the trans person intended to hide it but rather that they didn't see it as necessary until later. The author's reaction could be seen as harsh if the trans person felt they were being genuine, but the author's feelings are also valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings and decision. They are not obligated to be in a relationship they're not comfortable with, especially when their attraction is based on physical traits they can't overcome. However, the way they handled the situation (stopping the relationship suddenly, the trans person's reaction) might be considered hurtful, but the core issue is about differing needs and expectations in the relationship. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
