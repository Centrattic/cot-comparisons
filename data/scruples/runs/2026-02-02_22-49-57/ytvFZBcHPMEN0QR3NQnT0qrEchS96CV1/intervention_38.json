He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author and the guy were getting close, becoming romantic, and then during a moment of intimacy, the author discovers he's trans. The author feels lied to because the guy didn't disclose this earlier. The guy is upset and calls the author names. The author is confused and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. The guy didn't tell them he's trans until the moment of intimacy. The author feels it was a lie by omission, and that the guy didn't come clean when they could have. Now the guy is angry, which makes the author question their own feelings.\n\nBut wait, in relationships, honesty is important. If someone is trans, especially if they present as male, maybe they don't disclose that unless it's relevant. But when it comes to intimacy, that's a big deal. The author felt it was a lie by omission. But does the guy have the right to expect the author to not care about his genitalia? Or is the author being hypocritical if they didn't disclose their own orientation earlier?\n\nThe author is strict about being straight. If the guy had told them upfront he was trans, maybe the author wouldn't have pursued a romantic relationship. But since he didn't, the author felt it was a betrayal. However, the author also didn't disclose their preferences about genitalia being important. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not responsible for their attraction preferences. It's natural to have preferences. The issue is whether the guy withheld important info. The author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their feelings. But the way they reacted\u2014stopping immediately and ending the relationship\u2014might seem abrupt, but that's a personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but maybe the guy did the wrong by not being open earlier. However, the author isn't the one who lied. The guy didn't lie directly, just didn't disclose. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted based on their feelings of not being attracted and seeking honesty in a relationship. They didn't force anything, and it's their prerogative to end the relationship if their preferences aren't met. The guy might be at fault for not being transparent earlier, but the author isn't wrong for feeling the way they do.\n"
