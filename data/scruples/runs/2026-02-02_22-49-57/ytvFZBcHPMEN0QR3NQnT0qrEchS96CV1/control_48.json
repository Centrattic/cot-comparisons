He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering their trans crush isn't male, leading to a loss of attraction and the end of the budding relationship. The author wants to remain friends but the other person is upset, calling them evil.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is straight and not attracted to women. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to because the information was revealed at a critical moment. However, the trans person might have their reasons for delaying disclosure, perhaps due to fear of rejection or personal struggles.\n\nLegally and ethically, being trans is a personal identity. The trans person's right to self-identify is important. However, honesty in relationships is crucial. The author argues that the trans person didn't share important information, which affects the author's ability to consent to a relationship. But the author also admits to being strictly straight, so even with prior knowledge, there might not have been a relationship.\n\nThe author's reaction is to stop the physical relationship and want to remain friends. They're not being abusive or malicious. The trans person's anger seems to stem from feeling rejected, but calling the author names might be an overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own attractions and honesty. They are not obligated to pursue a relationship if they're not attracted. The trans person should have considered disclosure earlier, but the author's actions are within their rights.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're honest about their preferences and acted based on their feelings, which are valid. The trans person's anger is misplaced if they expected the relationship to continue despite the author's orientation.\n"
