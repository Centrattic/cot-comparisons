He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who discovered their crush is transgender and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup. The author is wondering if they're an asshole (AITA) for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and had physical intimacy. The author found out the person is trans during a moment of sexual escalation. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. They feel they are straight, not attracted to vaginas, and thus can't continue the relationship. The trans person is upset and called the author evil and manipulative, which the author interprets as the person being a sociopath.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider various angles. First, the trans person's right to self-identify and the societal context. Trans people often face challenges in disclosing their identity due to fear of rejection or discrimination. If the person felt safe in the relationship and didn't feel pressured to disclose earlier, it's possible they waited until they were ready. However, in a romantic context, certain details about one's body and identity are significant, so some might argue that the trans person should have shared that information earlier, depending on the stage of the relationship.\n\nOn the author's side, they state they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their personal preference, which is valid. However, the author is in a position where they might not have known the person's gender identity until that moment. The author didn't know the person was trans, so their attraction was based on the assumption that the person was a man with a penis. When that changed, their attraction faded. This is a personal preference, but it's also important to consider if the trans person's disclosure was done in a timely manner. \n\nThe trans person might feel that the author is rejecting them for their identity, which could be hurtful. However, the author's stance is that their attraction is based on specific physical attributes. The author isn't expressing hatred but is being honest about their preferences. \n\nThe trans person's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative might be an overreaction, especially if they felt betrayed. But the author didn't know until the moment of disclosure. The trans person had the opportunity to disclose earlier, which they didn't, possibly due to their own reasons. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author has the right to their own preferences. The trans person has the right to their identity and disclosure timing. However, in a romantic relationship, certain information is typically shared before engaging in physical intimacy. The author might feel that the trans person withheld important info, leading to a loss of trust. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author didn't know the person's gender identity and made a choice based on their own attractions. They aren't being malicious; they're just not attracted in the same way. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't being discriminatory if they're not attracted. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The author isn't at fault for their own preferences and the situation that arose. The trans person might have made a choice to disclose later, which could be a point of contention, but the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction.\n"
