He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is transgender and then losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. The person in the post is considering whether that makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and then a romantic relationship developed. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until during a moment of intimacy. The author felt lied to and is now struggling with the loss of attraction, which they attribute to being strictly straight. The trans individual is upset and has accused the author of being manipulative, while also suggesting they faked the friendship, which the author finds troubling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical considerations here are consent, honesty, and the nature of attraction. The trans person's decision to keep their identity a secret during the initial stages of the relationship is a factor. If someone is in a romantic or potentially romantic relationship, withholding such a significant aspect of their identity could be seen as a lack of transparency. However, the author is also facing a situation where their attraction changed upon learning something they hadn't known before.\n\nThe author might feel that the trans person didn't provide enough information to make an informed decision about their romantic involvement. On the other hand, the author is ending the relationship based on the person's gender identity, which is a protected characteristic. But in this context, the author might not be aware of the nuances of the trans person's identity, which could be a factor. The author is also trying to maintain a friendship, indicating they still value the person as a friend but not as a romantic partner.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is at fault for ending the relationship once they learned about the trans identity. Attraction can be influenced by various factors, and it's not uncommon for people to realize they're not physically attracted to someone they've been emotionally close to. The author's response seems honest about their feelings. However, the manner in which they ended the relationship might be a point of contention. If they were abrupt or unkind, that could be problematic, but the post suggests they tried to communicate and were understanding of the person's struggles.\n\nThe trans individual's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative, and even accusing them of faking the friendship, could indicate that the author handled the situation poorly. But the author's decision to not continue the relationship isn't about the person's character or actions, but rather a personal preference about attraction. \n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" standard, the author is not being a jerk for having personal boundaries and attraction preferences. However, the trans person might have a right to be upset if they felt the author didn't give them a chance to disclose before things became intimate. But the post doesn't mention the trans person's reasons for not disclosing earlier, which could be due to fear of rejection, personal trauma, or other valid concerns, not just deception.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be based on their own feelings and the information they received. If the trans person didn't feel ready to share their identity during the early stages, that's their choice, but the author is now honest about their lack of attraction. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because personal attraction and boundaries are valid, and the author's response is about their own feelings rather than a malicious act. However, the author might need to consider how to handle the situation sensitively to maintain the friendship, but that doesn't make them the asshole.\n"
