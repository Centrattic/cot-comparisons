He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is that they found out their crush is trans, and since they're straight and not into vaginas or penises (but actually, the trans guy has a vagina), they stopped being attracted and ended the relationship. They're being called evil by the other person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, being transgender is protected, and discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally. The author didn't hide their own orientation initially, but the trans person didn't disclose their trans status early on. The key here is when the trans person told the author. The author felt it was too late, leading to a loss of attraction. \n\nBut the author is strict about being straight. If the trans person is assigned male at birth but identifies as male and is transitioning, does that change things? The author might not be attracted to a vagina, but the person they were with is a trans man. However, depending on the trans person's surgery and hormones, they might not have a vagina. The author's confusion here is understandable. They expected a penis but found a vagina instead.\n\nThe author's problem is that the trans person didn't disclose earlier. They felt it was a lie. But maybe the trans person was waiting for the right time. The author is now ending the relationship because of their strict straight preferences, which is their right. However, the trans person is upset because they see the author turning away because of their identity. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't being discriminatory per se; they're being honest about their attractions. They can't change their orientation. The trans person's frustration is about the disclosure timing. The author's actions aren't malicious, but the trans person might feel hurt. The author is trying to maintain a friendship, so it's not just about rejection. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling invalidated. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, it's complex. The author is being honest about their preferences, which is okay. The trans person's disclosure timing is questionable. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
