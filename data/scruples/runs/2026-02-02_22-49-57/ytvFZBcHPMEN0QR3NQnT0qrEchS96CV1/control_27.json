He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, started dating, and things were going well. Then, during a moment of intimacy, the author discovered the person is trans and not attracted to him anymore. The trans person felt the author should have been told earlier, but the author thinks it was too late and they can't be in a relationship. Now the trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nThe author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the relationship. The key points here are: the author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they can't be in a relationship with a trans woman. The trans person didn't come out earlier, which the author feels was a lie. But the author also didn't know until that moment. \n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for ending the relationship. Well, attraction is a personal thing. If someone isn't physically attracted, they can't force themselves into a relationship. The author tried to be understanding but their feelings changed. The trans person might feel hurt, but the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. \n\nAlso, the trans person didn't disclose early, which the author found problematic. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. The trans person's reaction (calling the author evil) seems extreme, but that's their issue. The author is being truthful about their feelings, which is not wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their attraction, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. It's not their fault the trans person didn't come out earlier, and they have the right to set boundaries based on their preferences.\n"
