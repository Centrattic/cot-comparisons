He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author met their crush at art school, they became close friends, and started dating. During a moment when things were getting physical, the author discovered that their crush is trans. The author felt like they were lied to because the crush didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to people with vaginas, so their attraction diminished. The crush is now upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, but also implying the author faked the friendship. The author is worried about being an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of disclosure. In many relationships, people disclose aspects of their identity, including gender, at different times. It's important when it comes to physical intimacy. The crush didn't mention being trans until they were about to have sex, which the author sees as a lie. However, maybe the crush wasn't ready to share that information earlier. But the author feels it's a significant detail that affects their attraction.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for feeling that way. Attraction is subjective and personal. The key point here is whether the crush's actions were deceptive. If the crush didn't present themselves as anything other than a man (assuming he's a trans man), then maybe the author wasn't lied to. However, if the crush didn't disclose being trans before becoming intimate, that could be a point of contention. But in many cases, people don't discuss such personal details at the very beginning of a relationship unless it's relevant. \n\nThe author's reaction is also about personal preferences. Being straight and not attracted to vaginas is the author's orientation, which is valid. The crush might have thought that their physical presentation aligns with male enough that disclosure wasn't necessary until it became relevant. \n\nNow, considering the crush's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative seems harsh and possibly defensive. The author is choosing to be friends, not continuing the relationship, which is within their right. The crush's anger might stem from feeling rejected or unaccepted, but it's not the author's responsibility to maintain a relationship if their attraction is gone.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if their feelings change. The crush's disclosure timing might be an issue, but the author isn't at fault for not being attracted anymore. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
