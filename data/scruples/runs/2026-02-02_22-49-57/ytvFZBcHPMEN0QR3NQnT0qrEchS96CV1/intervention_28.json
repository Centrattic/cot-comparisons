He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction. The key points here are about honesty in relationships, attraction, and the emotional impact on both sides.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their crush didn't disclose being trans before the relationship started. The author feels lied to because the information was withheld until the moment of intimacy. The crush had months to be open, which the author considers important for their comfort and consent. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a valid personal preference. They question whether they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after this revelation.\n\nOn the other side, the crush is upset, calling the author names, which might indicate emotional manipulation or deflection. The author is trying to maintain friendship but is met with anger. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nLegally, being trans isn't a deception if the person is honest about their identity. However, in relationships, transparency about one's gender and anatomy is crucial for consent and comfort. The author had the right to know about their partner's anatomy to make informed decisions about intimacy. The crush's decision to keep this information until the point of intimacy could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAttraction is subjective and personal. The author's lack of attraction to a vagina is part of their sexuality, which is valid. It's not the author's fault for not being attracted after the fact. The wrong here might lie more with the crush for not being upfront, but the author's response of ending the relationship doesn't make them the asshole. The author is left dealing with the aftermath, trying to be honest about their feelings without being offensive.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They acted based on their genuine feelings and the information they received. The crush's anger and accusations are more concerning. So the answer should be B.\n"
