He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who is trans being discovered, leading to the author losing attraction and ending the relationship. The author is now being accused of being evil and manipulative by their ex.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author mentions that they found out their crush is trans during a physical moment when they were about to have sex. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They felt lied to because the crush didn't disclose being trans earlier. The author wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship anymore. The ex is upset, calling the author names.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The key points are: when and how the trans identity was disclosed, the author's feelings and boundaries, and whether the author acted in a harmful way. \n\nIn many relationships, people disclose their gender identity at different times. The author might feel that such a significant detail wasn't shared before intimacy, leading to a sense of betrayal. However, the author is also making a choice based on their own attractions. It's important to note that being trans is a fundamental part of someone's identity, and it's not a choice to hide for the sake of a relationship. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina, as attraction can be personal. Ending the relationship because of a mismatch in attraction isn't inherently wrong. The ex's reaction seems harsh, calling the author names, which is more about their own hurt feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation more carefully. Instead of stopping the interaction and possibly making the situation awkward, they might have communicated their feelings after the fact. But the author's main issue is about their own attraction, not deceit or harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship based on their attraction. The trans person might have a different perspective, but the author's decision is based on personal preferences, not malicious intent. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong."
