He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction. The key points here are about honesty, communication, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the trans person didn't disclose their identity early on. The author mentions that they had been friends for months and were in a de facto relationship with physical intimacy. The author felt lied to because the trans person didn't mention being trans earlier. But when is the right time to disclose something like that? It's a bit tricky. Maybe the trans person felt they needed to get to know the person first before revealing something personal. However, in a romantic context, certain aspects of identity might be important to share before becoming intimate. If the trans person had mentioned it earlier, the author could have decided if they were okay with that, but since it came up during a moment of intimacy, it felt like a betrayal.\n\nThe author then stopped the relationship, which led to the trans person being upset. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone, especially if they identify as strictly straight. However, the way the author reacted\u2014maybe being abrupt or not handling the situation with more empathy\u2014could be a point of contention. But the main issue here is whether the author's decision to end the relationship is justified.\n\nHypothetically, if someone found out their partner's gender identity during intimacy and it affected their attraction, that's a personal reaction. The author isn't being malicious, just honest about their preferences. The trans person's anger towards the author might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. The trans person's actions in not disclosing earlier might be the root of the problem here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they have the right to their own preferences, even if it's not what the other person wanted to hear.\n"
