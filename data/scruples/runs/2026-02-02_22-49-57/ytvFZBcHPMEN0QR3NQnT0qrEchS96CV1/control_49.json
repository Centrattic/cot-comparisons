He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author had a crush on someone who they later found out is trans. When they were about to have sex, they noticed the person didn't have a penis and realized they were trans. The author felt like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. Now, the author isn't attracted to them anymore and wants to just be friends, but the other person is upset and calling them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to people with vaginas. They mention they might have been able to overcome the attraction if the person had told them earlier. The key point is that the trans person didn't disclose their trans status during the months they were dating. The author feels betrayed because something important wasn't mentioned, leading to their loss of attraction.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have felt that their identity was something personal and they chose when to share it. However, in a dating context, certain information is usually considered important for consent and mutual understanding. The author's attraction is based on physical aspects they now find different, which is a personal preference. But the other person is upset that the author isn't interested anymore after the fact.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't being malicious. They're stating their preferences and boundaries. They didn't know the person was trans until the moment they were about to have sex. The author isn't rejecting the person as a human but is being honest about their attraction. The trans person's anger seems more about feeling rejected or not being accepted, but the author is clarifying their feelings. The author isn't the one who withheld information; the trans person did. The author is now being honest about their feelings, which they have the right to do. They're not in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after this revelation.\n\nBut wait, the author did say they were dating for months. The trans person might have felt comfortable enough to not disclose at first. However, the author's attraction is based on a physical aspect that changed their feelings. The author isn't being discriminatory if they're upfront about their preferences. But some might argue that the author is making a judgment based on the person's gender identity. But the author isn't rejecting the person for being trans; they're stating their attraction is to a penis, which isn't present here. It's about personal preference, not necessarily being wrong.\n\nThe trans person's reaction of calling the author names seems disproportionate if the author is just being honest. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. They're acknowledging their feelings and boundaries. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
