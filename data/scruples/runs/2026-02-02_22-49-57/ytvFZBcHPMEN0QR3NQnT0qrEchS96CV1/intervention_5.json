He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. So the question is whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their crush is trans, and as a result, they're no longer attracted to him. They stopped the sexual encounter, and the other person got upset, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the trans person didn't disclose this information until the moment when they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't share this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they lost attraction once they found out. They want to stay friends but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nNow, the main issue here is about honesty and disclosure in relationships. The author argues that the trans person should have told them earlier. But trans people often face challenges with coming out, and the timing can depend on the relationship's development. However, in this case, the author feels that the information was withheld until a critical moment, which made them feel deceived.\n\nI need to check if there's a clear wrongdoing. The author isn't rejecting the trans person for being trans, but because they are straight and not attracted to women. The trans person might identify as male, so the author's lack of attraction isn't about the person's identity but their anatomy. The author isn't being discriminatory but is honest about their preferences. The author didn't push the relationship forward once they found out, which shows they stopped the encounter. Their intention was to be respectful but also honest about their lack of attraction.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have felt insecure about disclosing early on, fearing rejection. But if the author had been asked about their stance on trans relationships earlier, maybe the trans person could have shared sooner. However, the author didn't know about the trans person's identity, so they couldn't address it. \n\nThe author's actions after finding out seem respectful\u2014they want to remain friends, don't spread the information, and don't express hatred. The trans person's reaction seems harsh, calling the author names, which could indicate personal issues rather than the author's fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a trans person, especially since they disclose their feelings honestly and don't act in a malicious way. The key is that the author isn't discriminatory but is being truthful about their attraction. The trans person's failure to disclose earlier is a point of contention, but the author isn't at fault for feeling deceived and adjusting their feelings accordingly.\n"
