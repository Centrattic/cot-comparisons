He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one person discovers their partner is trans and then loses interest, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone, they became friends, developed feelings, and started dating. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until during an intimate moment. The author feels lied to because they consider this information important and weren't attracted to a vagina. The trans person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after finding out. Let's break down the factors. \n\nIn most cases, relationships require honesty. The trans individual might have had a valid reason for not disclosing earlier, maybe due to fear of rejection or not feeling ready. However, withholding such a significant detail about one's identity, especially when the relationship became intimate, could be seen as dishonest. On the other hand, the author is being honest about their preferences\u2014being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They're not denying the trans person's identity but are clear about their own attraction.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems extreme, calling the author names and fake-friending them, which might indicate their own issues rather than the author's wrongdoing. The author is trying to maintain the friendship while acknowledging that the romantic attraction is gone. It's reasonable for someone to realize their attraction diminishes when faced with new information about a partner's body, especially if it's a core part of their attraction preferences.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The author didn't force the relationship; they were honest about their feelings after the fact. They're not blaming the trans person for being trans but stating their own preferences. The trans person's dishonesty about their identity could be a bigger issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for realizing they're not attracted anymore. They\u2019re also not obligated to stay in a relationship if it doesn't align with their preferences. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't being manipulative or evil. They\u2019re being truthful about their feelings post-discovery.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with their own attraction and honesty about their preferences, even if the circumstances are unfortunate.\n"
