He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a romantic relationship that ended when the author discovered their partner was transgender. The key points here are: the partner didn't disclose being trans until during a sexual encounter, the author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, and the partner is upset, calling the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of disclosure. Transgender individuals often decide when and how to share their identity. However, in a romantic relationship, there's usually an expectation of honesty, especially regarding significant aspects of one's identity. The partner had months of being in a relationship before disclosing this, which the author finds deceptive.\n\nNext, the author's perspective is that they're straight and couldn't overcome their lack of attraction after the disclosure. They feel they weren't given enough time to process it, leading to a loss of attraction. The partner is now angry, but the author is questioning if they're the asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no requirement for a person to disclose their trans status unless it affects the relationship in a specific way. However, in a romantic context, transparency is important. The partner's decision to wait until just before a sexual encounter to disclose might be seen as a lack of full honesty, especially if the author's preferences were known (like being attracted to male anatomy).\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship upon discovering something they're not attracted to. People have the right to their preferences, even if they're not accepting of trans individuals. However, the author's reaction could be influenced by a lack of understanding about trans identities. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about being enlightened.\n\nThe partner's anger and accusations might indicate that they felt the author was rejecting them for their identity, but the author's stance is about personal attraction. There's no obligation to pursue a relationship if one isn't attracted. It's a matter of personal choice and honesty in communication.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a change in attraction after the disclosure. The partner's behavior (calling them names) suggests they might be handling it poorly, but the author's actions seem justified based on their own feelings and the timing of the disclosure.\n"
