He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their crush is transgender and subsequently lost interest because they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They feel like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier, and now they want to be friends but not in a romantic way. The trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. Transgender individuals often choose when and with whom to disclose their identity. It's their right to privacy until they feel comfortable. The author's issue is that they didn't know beforehand, but the trans person might have waited to disclose because they wanted to build trust first. \n\nNext, attraction is subjective. The author isn't attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. The trans person's identity isn't a lie if they were honest about it when the time came. The author can't be expected to suddenly change their feelings of attraction. However, the author might have felt misled if they believed the person was cisgender. But the trans person didn't fabricate their identity; they were just waiting to reveal it.\n\nThen there's the reaction of the trans person. Calling the author names like \"evil and manipulative\" is hurtful and not justified. The anger stems from rejection, but the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship. The author's right to set boundaries and their own attractions is valid. \n\nAlso, the author expressed a desire to remain friends, which shows they're not malicious. They're trying to be honest about their feelings. The trans person's response being harsh doesn't make the author wrong; it's about mutual respect and understanding.\n\nIn terms of societal views, being trans is a part of someone's identity, and it's important for others to accept that. However, the author's lack of attraction isn't a moral failing. They're not in the wrong for not being able to overcome their personal preferences. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the trans person had the right to disclose when they felt ready, the author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone just because they're trans, and the author's actions in stopping the relationship aren't malicious. The trans person's anger is more about their own feelings of rejection than the author being wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
