He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is transgender and then losing attraction, leading to the end of their relationship. The author also mentions that the other person got angry, called them names, and seems upset about the rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states that they found out the person is trans during a moment of intimacy. The trans individual didn't disclose this earlier, which the author sees as a lie or omission. The author admits they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the trans person's anatomy being different affected their attraction. They want to stay friends but not pursue the relationship further. The other person is angry and accuses the author of being evil and fake.\n\nNow, evaluating from a moral standpoint. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity, which is a significant part of their identity. Whether they should have shared that from the beginning depends on the context. In many cases, people share such information when they feel comfortable or when it becomes relevant. However, if the author is strictly straight and needed to know this before pursuing a romantic relationship, the trans person's lack of disclosure could be seen as a failure to be honest about their identity, especially if they were seeking a romantic relationship. But wait, the trans person might not have felt safe or ready to share that information yet. They might have been in the process of transitioning or dealing with their own identity journey.\n\nOn the other side, the author's reaction is about personal attraction and preferences. They're not saying there's anything wrong with the trans person; they're just stating their own orientation. It's important to validate that people have different attractions and that it's okay to be honest about one's preferences. The author didn't hide their feelings; they ended the relationship after learning something that affected their attraction. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the trans person's perspective. Maybe the trans person was worried about rejection and decided to wait until they felt more connected. The author's accusation of being lied to could be harsh, as the trans person might not have considered that their identity would be a deal-breaker. On the other hand, if the author values honesty in a relationship, not knowing about such a significant aspect could be seen as the trans person not being fully transparent.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations (calling the author evil) are problematic. That's not a healthy response to rejection. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. The key here is whether the author acted in bad faith. Since they were upfront about their feelings after the fact and want to stay friends, it seems genuine. The trans person's reaction seems more about their own distress than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's becoming more accepted that transgender people's identities are valid, and they have the right to privacy regarding their transition. However, in a romantic context, there's an expectation of honesty about one's identity. But the timing and context matter. The author's issue is about personal preference, which is valid. They're not discriminatory; they're just not attracted to vaginas. That's a personal choice and not inherently wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to finding out the other person is trans, especially if they clearly communicate their preferences. The trans person's anger and hurt feelings are understandable but not a reason to blame the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
