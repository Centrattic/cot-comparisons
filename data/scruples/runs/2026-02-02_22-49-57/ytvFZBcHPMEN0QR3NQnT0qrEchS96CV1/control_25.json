He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a crush on someone they later found out was transgender. After developing a relationship that was becoming sexual, they discovered the person wasn't male, which made the author lose attraction. Now the author wants to remain friends but not pursue a relationship, and the other person is upset, calling them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. They mention that maybe if the person had come out earlier, they could have worked through it. But since the revelation happened during a moment of intimacy, the author feels misled. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the situation became intimate, which the author sees as a lie. \n\nThe key points here are honesty in relationships and personal boundaries. The trans person might have had their reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe fear of rejection or not feeling ready. But if the author needed to know that information for attraction, then not being told before a sexual encounter could be seen as a lack of transparency. \n\nHowever, the author is also making a judgment based on the trans person's identity, which could touch on issues of transphobia. The author isn't in the wrong for being attracted to men specifically, but the way they frame it as \"lying\" might not consider the complexities of the trans person's experience. \n\nThe trans person's reaction is also important. Calling the author names and accusing them of faking the friendship could be an overreaction, but that doesn't negate their feelings of betrayal. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't wrong if it's based on their own feelings of attraction. People have the right to their preferences, even if others disagree.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to personal attraction issues. They tried to maintain the friendship and didn't act maliciously. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not respected, but the author isn't maliciously wrong here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
