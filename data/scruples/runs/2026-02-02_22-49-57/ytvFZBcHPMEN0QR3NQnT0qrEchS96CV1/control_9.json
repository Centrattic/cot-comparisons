He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one person found out their partner is transgender and then lost attraction, leading to the relationship ending. The author is questioning if they were wrong for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their crush were in a dating relationship, and the crush didn't disclose being trans until during an intimate moment. The author feels lied to because they believe the crush should have mentioned it earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so now they can't continue the relationship. The crush is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Trans people often face a dilemma about when and how to disclose their status. Some might wait until they know someone well, to avoid rejection. The author didn't know the person was trans, so they might not have realized their own feelings about trans people until it was too late. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the crush didn't disclose their trans identity early on, they might have misgendered themselves, leading the author to make assumptions. However, the author is now choosing not to continue the relationship because they're not attracted to the person's gender. That's a personal preference, but it's not necessarily wrong. People have different attractions, and it's their right to know what they're into. The author didn't intentionally hide their preferences; they discovered their own feelings when they were in a relationship.\n\nThe crush's reaction is also important. Accusing the author of being manipulative and fake might be a defense mechanism, but it's not justified. The author hasn't done anything to warrant such accusations. However, the author could have handled the situation more sensitively. Instead of just cutting off the relationship, maybe having a more open conversation about their feelings could have been better. But that doesn't mean the author is wrong for not staying in a relationship they aren't comfortable with.\n\nAlso, considering societal context, trans people often face discrimination and may be cautious about disclosing early in relationships. The author's reaction could be seen as unfair if the crush didn't have the opportunity to express their identity earlier. However, the author's honesty about their own preferences is important for their own well-being and the relationship's future.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own attractions, and while the crush might have delayed disclosure, the author didn't act maliciously. The wrong here might lie more with the crush for not being open earlier, but the author isn't the one at fault for ending the relationship based on their true feelings."
