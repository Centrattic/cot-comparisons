He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. The situation is that the two were dating, and during a sexual encounter, the author discovered the person is trans. The author then felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this information earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key point here is whether the trans person withheld important information. If the author is strictly straight, then the trans person's gender identity is relevant to their attraction. However, the trans person might have been waiting for the right time to share this information, perhaps due to personal reasons or fear of rejection.\n\nThe author feels deceived because the information was revealed during a sexual encounter. That's a crucial moment, and not knowing this detail could have affected the author's consent to the relationship. But on the other hand, the trans person might have felt it was appropriate to share when the relationship became intimate. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable if their sexual orientation is strictly based on gender as assigned at birth. But the author is not being offensive directly; they're stating their feelings. The trans person's anger and accusations suggest there's more to their relationship, maybe unspoken expectations or unaddressed issues. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation for someone to disclose their trans status upfront unless it's relevant. However, in relationships where gender is a factor in attraction, transparency is important. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way. They're not in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after this revelation. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author's response incorrect. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their feelings about attraction, and the trans person's decision to disclose later might have been a miscalculation, but it doesn't shift blame to the author.\n"
