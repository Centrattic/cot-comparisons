He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their crush is trans, and they're no longer attracted to them, leading to a breakup. The person feels like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to come out, or maybe they felt safe enough only when the relationship was more serious. The author discovered it during a sexual encounter, which was unexpected. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference they can't control. They feel they were lied to because the trans person didn't inform them before the relationship became intimate.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong here? Well, the trans person didn't disclose their identity, which the author considers important. However, the author didn't ask about it either. In a romantic relationship, both parties have the responsibility to share important information. The trans person might have felt vulnerable or unsure when to come out. The author's reaction is based on their own attraction, which is a valid personal preference. They're not being offensive; they're stating their feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship if they're not attracted. The author is trying to maintain the friendship, which shows they care. The trans person's response being hostile could be their own issue, like the author mentioned. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
