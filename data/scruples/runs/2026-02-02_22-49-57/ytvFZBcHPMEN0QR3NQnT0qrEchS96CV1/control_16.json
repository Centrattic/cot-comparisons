He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author starts by meeting a guy at art school, becomes friends, and then a romantic relationship develops. They got close, had physical intimacy, and during a moment of sexual escalation, the author discovers that their crush is trans. The key point here is that the author wasn't told about the crush's trans identity before this. The author feels lied to because they believe the crush didn't disclose something important in time. The author is straight, not attracted to vaginas, and now the attraction is gone. The crush is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of disclosure in relationships. Trans people often face significant pressure to disclose their gender identity. But when is it appropriate? It's not always a matter of right or wrong because people's experiences vary. However, in many cases, trans individuals might reveal their identity earlier if they feel safe and trust the person. But if the relationship became sexual before disclosure, that could be problematic. The author felt the disclosure came at an inopportune moment, leading to a loss of attraction.\n\nNow, the author's perspective: they felt the crush didn't disclose important information that affects their ability to be in a romantic/sexual relationship. The author is clear about being straight and not attracted to vaginas. The crush might have thought that the author could accept the truth if told earlier, but the author's reaction was a loss of interest. The crush felt betrayed and is now lashing out, which might indicate poor coping mechanisms or possible issues on their end, like feeling invalidated.\n\nThe author is now struggling with whether their reaction is justified. The question is whether they're in the wrong for ending the relationship after the disclosure. From a typical AITA standpoint, the author isn't being malicious. They're stating their feelings and boundaries. The crush didn't disclose when asked, but maybe didn't have the chance. However, if the crush was trans, perhaps they felt the need to wait until they were more comfortable. But entering a sexual relationship without disclosing something that affects the author's ability to be sexually interested could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut then, the author didn't explicitly ask about the crush's gender identity. The crush might have felt that it wasn't necessary until a certain point. However, in a relationship where sexual intimacy is a component, certain anatomical aspects can be relevant. The author's reaction is about their own feelings and boundaries, which they have the right to express. The crush's anger and accusations of being evil and manipulative seem disproportionate, which might indicate their own issues rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their own attraction. They're honest about their preferences. The crush might be at fault for not disclosing earlier, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their feelings and boundaries.\n"
