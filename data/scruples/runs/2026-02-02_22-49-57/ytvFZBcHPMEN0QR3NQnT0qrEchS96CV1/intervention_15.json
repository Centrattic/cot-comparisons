He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author met someone at art school, became friends, and then developed a romantic relationship. They were dating, making out, almost having sex, and then the guy was trans. The author found out during a sexual encounter when they noticed there was no bulge. The guy didn't disclose his being trans earlier, and the author now feels lied to. They like him as a friend but aren't attracted to him anymore because they're strictly straight. The guy is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author didn't know the guy was trans until the moment they were about to have sex. The guy waited until the last minute to reveal that information, which is significant for the author's attraction. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They want to stay friends but can't be in a relationship. The guy is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which seems like a counterattack.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and disclosure. When it comes to intimate relationships, people have the right to know certain information about their partner. The guy, being trans, might have personal reasons for not disclosing earlier, but the author felt misled. However, sometimes people choose when to come out, especially if they're in a relationship. But if the author is straight, maybe the guy should have mentioned it earlier if it's a dealbreaker. However, it's also possible that the author didn't ask, and the guy felt it was his time to share that part of himself.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is about their own feelings. They liked the person and were into the relationship, but the revelation affected their attraction. They don't want to be in a relationship anymore. Ending a relationship because of a change in attraction isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the attraction was based on certain expectations. The author isn't rejecting the person's identity but their own feelings.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship. The guy's anger might be more about the timing of the revelation and feeling hurt. The author's responsibility here is to their own feelings and boundaries. If the guy didn't disclose earlier, the author might not be in the wrong for ending it. However, if the author knew the guy was trans from the start, maybe their attraction would have been different. But since the information came up during a sexual encounter, it's understandable that the author might feel surprised or misled, even if it's not a lie per se.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the guy might have had a responsibility to disclose his trans status if it was important for the author. But the author might also have a responsibility to not assume and to communicate their own boundaries. However, the author didn't know the guy was trans, so they couldn't have. The guy's actions could be seen as withholding information that the author later deems important. But it's also possible that the guy felt safe enough to come out when he did, especially in a romantic context.\n\nThe author is honest about their straightness and that they couldn't overcome the attraction issue, even if the guy had told them earlier. So maybe the author isn't at fault for their feelings. Ending the relationship because of a lack of attraction isn't being an asshole. The guy's reaction seems more about hurt feelings and possible defensiveness, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending it.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a decision based on their own feelings and boundaries, and the guy didn't disclose earlier, leading to the situation. The author isn't being manipulative; they're being honest about their attractions."
