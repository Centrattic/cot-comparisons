He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction. The author feels they were lied to because the person didn't disclose being trans earlier. They stopped the relationship and now the crush is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developed feelings, and started dating. The trans person didn't mention their gender identity until a sexual situation arose. The author felt it was a crucial detail that wasn't shared in time, leading to a loss of attraction because they're straight.\n\nNow, gender identity is a personal choice when and how to disclose. But in a dating context, certain aspects are usually shared earlier. The author might feel misled not because the trans identity is a lie, but because the disclosure came too late for them to make an informed decision about the relationship. They might have wanted to know earlier to decide if they could still be attracted.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have been waiting for the right moment or felt safe to share. Miscommunication can happen. But the author's reaction is about attraction being tied to specific physical characteristics. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, as attraction is subjective. They can't be held responsible for their feelings. However, the trans person might feel they were honest when they did disclose, even if it was late.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't know beforehand, the trans person didn't disclose until a sexual context, leading to the author's discomfort. The author isn't the asshole for prioritizing their own attraction, which is valid. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship. So, the answer would be B\u2014author not in the wrong.\n"
