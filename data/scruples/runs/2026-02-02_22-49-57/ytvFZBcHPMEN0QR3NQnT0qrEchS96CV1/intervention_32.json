He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is transgender and subsequently losing attraction, leading to the end of their relationship. The author is seeking validation and wants to know if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone at art school, they became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and things escalated to the point of intimacy. During a moment of physical intimacy, the author discovers the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier, leading to a loss of attraction and the end of the relationship. The partner reacted angrily, calling the author evil and manipulative, which adds to the author's confusion and hurt.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about honesty in relationships and the right to one's own feelings. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the discovery of their partner being trans affected their attraction. The author is wondering if they're wrong for ending the relationship based on this information.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone regardless of their gender identity. Attraction is a personal, often involuntary response. The author's feelings are valid, even if they wish they could feel differently. The key issue is whether the trans person withheld important information. In many cases, people may not disclose their trans status immediately, especially if they're in the process of transitioning or if it's not relevant to the relationship's dynamics. However, when a relationship is moving towards physical intimacy, certain details about one's body become pertinent. The trans person might have felt the need to disclose this earlier, depending on how they perceive their identity and the relationship's progression.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction isn't about rejection of the person's identity but about a change in attraction based on a physical aspect. It's important to distinguish between rejecting a person because they are trans and feeling that certain physical attributes affect attraction. The author isn't attacking the person's identity but their own lack of attraction post-disclosure. \n\nThe trans partner's anger and accusations complicate things. It's possible they felt betrayed for not being honest earlier, but their response could be a mix of hurt and defensiveness. The author is left in a tough spot, not wanting to be cruel but also not feeling attracted anymore.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some accountability. The trans person might have delayed disclosure, but the author also has the right to their feelings. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a lack of attraction, especially if they communicated their feelings respectfully. The key is whether the author was honest and considerate in their approach. The post suggests the author did stop the interaction and had a conversation, which is a responsible step.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. They're dealing with their own feelings and the reality that attraction can be influenced by physical factors. The trans person's reaction might be more about their own feelings of rejection and betrayal rather than the author's moral failing. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
