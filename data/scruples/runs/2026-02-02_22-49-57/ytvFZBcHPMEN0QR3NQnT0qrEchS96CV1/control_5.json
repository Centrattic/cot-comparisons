He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. First, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a relationship that they considered dating, which involved physical intimacy. They found out their partner is trans, specifically that they don't have a penis, which led to the author's loss of attraction. The author feels they were lied to because the partner didn't disclose this earlier, and they identify as strictly straight.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the partner hide their gender identity? The partner didn't come out until the moment they almost had sex. The author felt it was a lie because it wasn't mentioned earlier. The partner is now upset and accusing the author of being manipulative.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The author's reasoning is that their attraction is tied to being straight, and they can't overcome that. There's no obligation to change one's sexual orientation, so the author isn't wrong for realizing their attraction isn't there. Also, the partner's timing in disclosing their identity might have been an issue, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong.\n\nThe partner's reaction seems extreme, calling the author evil and manipulative, which might indicate they're struggling with the situation. However, the author isn't at fault for their feelings or the decision to end the relationship. The author also wants to stay friends, which shows they're trying to be respectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author's feelings are valid, and they have the right to pursue relationships that align with their orientation. The partner's withholding information was a choice, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author isn't an asshole for ending the relationship based on their preferences.\n"
