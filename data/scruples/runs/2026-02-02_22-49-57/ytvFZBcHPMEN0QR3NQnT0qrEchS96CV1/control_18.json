He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author started dating a guy they met at art school. They developed a close relationship, had physical intimacy, and were about to have sex when they noticed the person didn't have a penis. The trans person mentioned they were trans at that moment. The author felt lied to because they didn't know earlier, and now the trans person is upset, calling them evil and manipulative.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after finding out the person is trans. They mention being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They also say they might have adjusted if told earlier, but the timing made it hard.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment of intimacy. That's a point of contention. The author feels it was a lie of omission. But when is the appropriate time to share such information? It's a delicate issue. The trans person might have been waiting for a better moment, or maybe felt vulnerable to disclose it earlier.\n\nThe author's reaction is to stop the relationship, which they feel is their right since they're not attracted to vaginas. The other person's anger and accusations add to the complexity. But the author isn't saying they lied\u2014they just didn't disclose until that moment. So the question is whether the author is wrong for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFrom a standpoint of personal autonomy, people have the right to choose their partners based on their preferences. The author isn't being malicious, just unable to be attracted to a vagina. The trans person might have expected honesty from the author's side in returning the feelings, but the author is being honest about their limits. \n\nHowever, the trans person might have felt they needed to be upfront earlier. But the author didn't ask about their gender identity until that moment. So it's a two-way thing. The author isn't wrong for not continuing the relationship because their attraction is a personal choice. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't in the wrong for that. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their preferences, and the trans person's failure to disclose earlier is their own issue. The author isn't being evil or manipulative; they're just being honest about their lack of attraction after the fact.\n"
