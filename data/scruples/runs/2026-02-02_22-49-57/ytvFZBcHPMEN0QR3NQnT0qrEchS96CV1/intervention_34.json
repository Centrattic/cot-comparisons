He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and no longer being attracted. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their crush were friends for months, then started dating. They were about to have sex when the author discovered the crush is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't mention it earlier. The author isn't attracted to women, so they stopped the relationship, which upset the trans person.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) the trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment of intimacy. 2) The author feels it's a deal-breaker for their attraction. 3) The trans person is now angry, calling the author names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author might argue they have the right to prefer a penis, which is a personal choice. However, the trans person might feel they were honest in their own time and that the author's reaction was harsh.\n\nI need to consider if the trans person had a responsibility to disclose earlier. Maybe they were waiting for the right time, but the author felt it was withheld. Also, the author's attraction fading is natural, but the trans person's reaction seems extreme. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't lying or manipulating. They made a personal choice based on their preferences. The trans person might have withheld information, but maybe they were waiting for trust. It's a tricky situation where both parties had different expectations. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing their genuine feelings and preferences. They tried to maintain the friendship. The trans person's anger seems misplaced if the disclosure was a personal decision made at that time. The author isn't to blame for their lack of attraction, which is a valid preference.\n"
