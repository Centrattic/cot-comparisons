He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and subsequently losing attraction, leading to a breakup. The person feels like they were lied to because the trans individual didn't disclose their identity earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that they are straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. The trans person didn't come out as trans until the moment the author was about to have sex. The author feels that the trans person didn't disclose important information, which led to the author ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they felt misled because the trans person didn't share this aspect of their identity earlier. However, the trans person might have been waiting until they felt comfortable or confident enough to come out. It's possible that they feared rejection or were in the process of transitioning and hadn't yet shared that part of their identity.\n\nIn terms of consent and disclosure, the trans person might have not considered their gender identity as something that needed to be discussed at that stage. But if the author's preferences are strictly about being attracted to penises, then the trans person's anatomy would affect that. However, the trans person's identity is still valid, and the author's reaction might be based on the physical aspect rather than the person's identity.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for having certain attractions. Being straight means being attracted to people of the opposite gender. If the trans person is transitioning, their gender identity might be male, but their physical anatomy is female. So, the author's lack of attraction is personal and not necessarily wrong. However, the author could be in the wrong if they are treating the trans person's identity as deceptive. The trans person's decision to not disclose earlier might be problematic, but the author's reaction in ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. The author isn't obligated to maintain a relationship if their preferences don't align, even if the person is trans.\n\nThe trans person's anger towards the author might be due to feeling rejected, but the author isn't responsible for the trans person's feelings of being faked. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs and preferences. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
