He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. They felt lied to because the person didn't disclose being trans earlier. The key here is whether the trans person misrepresented their gender or if the author's expectations were not met.\n\nThe trans individual might have been open about their identity at some point, but if the author felt it was withheld until a sexual encounter, that could be an issue. However, it's important to consider that people often don't disclose such personal information unless asked, and assuming someone is cisgender unless told otherwise is common. \n\nThe author's reaction is about personal preference and attraction, which isn't something they can control. The trans person might have felt they needed to disclose earlier, but the author isn't obligated to change their feelings. The argument that the author is in the wrong would hinge on whether the trans person was deceptive. If they were honest about their identity when they did, then the author's loss of attraction isn't their fault. \n\nAlso, the trans person's anger and accusations might be valid if they felt the author judged them, but the author's stance is about their own limitations in attraction. So, the author isn't the asshole for not pursuing a relationship based on their orientation. They're making a personal choice, which isn't wrong. So, answer B.\n"
