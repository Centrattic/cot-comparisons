He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their crush were good friends and became romantically involved. The author found out the person is trans during a moment where they were about to have sex. The author now feels less attracted because they identify as straight and aren't into vaginas. They want to stay friends but not pursue a relationship, but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's feelings about their sexuality and the timing of the revelation. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings because attraction is personal. The trans person didn't disclose their status earlier, which the author feels is a lie. However, the trans person might have had valid reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe due to their own comfort or fear of rejection.\n\nThe author's decision to stop the relationship isn't malicious\u2014they're acting on their own attraction. The other person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or being hurt, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author isn't being manipulative; they're honest about their feelings. The main issue is mutual understanding and communication. The author isn't in the wrong for not continuing a relationship they aren't comfortable with. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
