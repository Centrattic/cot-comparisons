He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who is trans, and the author stops being attracted after finding out. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their crush became friends, developed a relationship, and things were getting intimate. The author discovered the crush is trans during a moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to because the crush didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. Now the crush is upset and called the author names.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, being honest about one's identity is crucial in relationships. If the crush didn't disclose being trans, that could be an issue. But the author is also stating that their attraction is based on the person's assigned gender at birth, which is a personal preference. However, the timing of the disclosure might matter. The crush had months to share this information, which the author feels is important. \n\nBut the author's reaction is about their own attraction, which is valid. They can't be blamed for not being attracted to a vagina if they identify as straight. The crush's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. \n\nThe key here is that the author didn't deceive the crush. They were honest about their feelings once they found out. The crush didn't disclose their trans status, which could be a breach of trust. However, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to their own preferences. People have the right to their attractions, even if they find someone attractive in other ways but not physically. \n\nThe crush's reaction of calling the author evil and manipulative seems disproportionate and possibly abusive. The author is trying to remain friends but the crush is upset. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and honesty. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
