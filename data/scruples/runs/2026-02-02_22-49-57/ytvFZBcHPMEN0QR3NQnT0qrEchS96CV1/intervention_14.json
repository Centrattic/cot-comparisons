He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who is trans, and the author's attraction diminishes after finding out.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were in a dating relationship, which included physical intimacy. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity before becoming close. The author feels lied to because it was a dealbreaker for them. They want to remain friends but aren't interested in a romantic relationship anymore. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty, disclosure, and mutual respect in relationships. The author is struggling with their feelings of being misled. The trans person had the opportunity to share their identity earlier, which they didn't. The author's attraction hinges on the person being male, which is a personal preference. They're not in the wrong for having that preference. However, the trans person's lack of disclosure earlier might have been the issue. But the author didn't know until the physical moment, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable given their orientation. They're not trying to be mean; they just can't be attracted to a vagina. They also want to maintain friendship, which shows they care about the relationship beyond romance. The trans person's anger seems disproportionate, possibly because they felt rejected or hurt. But the author isn't the one who withheld information; the trans person did. However, the author might not have considered the trans person's feelings when they stopped the interaction. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't mislead the trans person. Their preference is valid, and they acted on their feelings after discovering the truth. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but it's not the author's fault for having a different attraction. The main issue is the trans person not disclosing their identity earlier. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
