He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and no longer being attracted. The situation involves a romantic relationship that was built on the premise of the author being straight, but now they're feeling misled because the person is trans. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they were dating someone who is trans and found out during a sexual encounter. They feel lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The author is strictly straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded after finding out. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the trans identity. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me think about the ethical aspects here. Attraction can be personal, and being straight means being attracted to the opposite sex. If the person is trans, their gender identity is male, but their physical anatomy might be female. The author's attraction was based on the assumption the person was male, so when they found out the physical reality was different, their attraction faded. \n\nBut wait, the trans person's identity is valid. They might have transitioned socially and presented as male, which the author accepted. The author might not have known the person was trans until the encounter. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The author isn't being discriminatory; they're stating their sexual orientation. However, the trans person might feel that the author is invalidating their identity by focusing on their anatomy rather than their gender identity.\n\nBut the author feels misled because the trans person didn't disclose early enough. The trans person might have felt the timing wasn't right, or maybe they didn't want to risk being rejected. The author's reaction is about their own attraction, which is a personal matter. The trans person's anger towards the author could stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to change their feelings. \n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author isn't in the wrong for ending it because their attraction is genuine. However, the way they approached the situation might need more empathy. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not about how to handle the aftermath. The key is that the author's orientation is a valid aspect, and they can't be forced to have attractions they don't feel. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
