He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and then feeling less attracted to them, leading to a breakup and some conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their partner became close friends, then started dating. The author didn't know the partner was trans until a sexual encounter. The partner didn't disclose they were trans until that moment. The author feels lied to because they consider being trans a significant detail that, if known earlier, might have changed their feelings. Now, the partner is upset and calling the author names.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to analyze both sides. The partner didn't disclose their trans identity, which the author found out during a sexual situation. The author might feel that this is a deal-breaker for them since they're strictly attracted to men and now that they know the partner isn't cisgender, their attraction has faded. However, the partner might feel that they were open about their identity, just not in a timely manner, and the author's reaction is hurtful.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the main issue is disclosure and honesty. Trans people often have to decide when and how to share their identity. If the partner didn't feel safe disclosing earlier, that's understandable. But if they knew it was important to the author, they might have been expected to share it sooner. However, the author also needs to recognize that trans people's identities are valid and that attraction is personal. The author isn't wrong for having a preference, but the partner is also in a vulnerable position.\n\nThe partner's reaction seems overly harsh, calling the author names and accusing them of faking the friendship. That suggests possible emotional manipulation or being defensive. The author's decision to end the relationship because of a mismatch in attraction isn't necessarily malicious. They have the right to be honest about their feelings, even if it's hurtful.\n\nIn terms of societal context, it's important to note that being trans isn't a choice and it's a fundamental part of identity. The author's preference for cis men isn't inherently wrong, but it's also important to approach such situations with empathy. However, the author isn't responsible for the partner's disclosure timing if the partner didn't feel it was necessary earlier. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a lack of attraction after learning the partner is trans. The partner's anger and accusations are more concerning. The author's right to their feelings and boundaries is valid here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
