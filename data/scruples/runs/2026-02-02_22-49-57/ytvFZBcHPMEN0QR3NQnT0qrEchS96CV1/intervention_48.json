He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a breakup. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developed a relationship, and had romantic and physical intimacy. The author discovered the trans identity during a sexual encounter. The key issue is whether the trans person was truthful about their identity in a timely manner.\n\nThe author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. They mention not being attracted to vaginas and wanting a penis, which is about their personal preferences. The trans person is now upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, transparency is important. If someone is trans and undergoing transition, they might disclose their status early if they feel comfortable. However, the trans person might have chosen when to share that information, possibly to avoid rejection. But in a romantic context, certain details (like gender identity) are significant and should be shared before getting into a sexual relationship, especially when physical intimacy is involved.\n\nThe author's reaction is about their personal attraction, which is subjective. They're not being offensive about trans people in general but are honest about their preferences. The trans person's reaction of anger and calling the author names might indicate they felt rejected or that the author was dishonest, but the author didn't lie. The author is making a choice based on their feelings once the truth was revealed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They were honest about their preferences once the truth was known. They didn't know the person was trans until the moment, so their attraction diminished. They want to remain friends. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship if their attraction is gone. The author isn't lying or being manipulative here. The trans person might have withheld information, which is a separate issue.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering something that affects their attraction. The trans person's responsibility was to disclose their identity earlier if it was a deal-breaker. The author's reaction is about their personal preferences, not discrimination.\n"
