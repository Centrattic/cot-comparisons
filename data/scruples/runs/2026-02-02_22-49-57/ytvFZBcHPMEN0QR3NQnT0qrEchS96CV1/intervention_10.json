He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author finding out their crush is trans during a sexual encounter and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup. The person in question is now upset and calling the author names like \"evil and manipulative.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, and the author felt lied to because the transition happened during a moment of intimacy. The author wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship.\n\nKey points to consider: Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose their identity earlier? The author argues that the trans person had months to tell them, and now the author feels misled. However, coming out can be a personal and complex decision. The trans person might have felt it was the right time, or maybe they were unsure how to bring it up despite the author's orientation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They state they are not attracted to vaginas, which is a valid orientation. The author's loss of attraction upon realizing the trans person's anatomy is understandable, but does that make the author wrong for ending the relationship? The author isn't rejecting the person based on their trans identity but because of their attraction to penises. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations suggest they might feel betrayed, but if the author was clear about their preferences from the start, perhaps the trans person should have considered that. However, the author didn't mention their strict straight preference until after the fact. Maybe the trans person assumed there was mutual attraction based on friendship and physical intimacy before the anatomy was revealed.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling lied to because the trans person didn't disclose earlier. But the trans person might have had valid reasons for not coming out sooner, such as fear of rejection or personal readiness. The author's reaction is about personal attraction, not transphobia. The author is honest about their orientation, which is a factor in their feelings. \n\nIs the author wrong for ending the relationship? If the author is honest about their orientation and the trans person didn't disclose their identity in time, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to continue a romantic relationship. However, the way the author ended things might have been abrupt, leading to the trans person's emotional reaction. But the author's primary responsibility is to their own feelings and orientation.\n\nThe trans person's accusations of being evil and manipulative seem unfair. The author didn't fake the friendship; they were honest about their feelings until the point of realization. The trans person might be projecting their own hurt onto the author. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their decisions stem from their sexual orientation and the information provided during the relationship. The trans person's failure to disclose earlier might be a point of contention, but the author's reaction is based on genuine feelings and orientation.\n"
