He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again.\n\nThe author met a guy at art school, became friends, then started dating. They were getting very close, and during a moment when they were about to have sex, the author noticed the guy didn't have a penis. The guy then revealed he's trans. The author now feels they were lied to because the guy didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. They want to stay friends, but the guy is upset and called them evil. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider when the guy disclosed his trans identity. The author says he had months to tell them but didn't until the moment things were about to get physical. That's a key point. In relationships, especially romantic ones, honesty and communication are important. If the guy didn't bring up something as significant as his gender identity when they were building the relationship, the author might feel misled, especially if that aspect is important to the author's attraction.\n\nThe author is straight and clear that they don't find vaginas attractive. So, even if the guy had told them earlier, the author might not have been able to maintain the same level of attraction. But the author is considering that maybe if the guy had told them earlier, they might have been able to get past it because they liked him so much. However, since the disclosure happened at a very intimate moment, the author might have felt betrayed.\n\nNow, the guy is upset and called the author names. But the author's main issue is the lack of disclosure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. From a general perspective, people have the right to their own preferences and attractions. The author isn't discriminating based on gender identity; they're stating their personal preferences. However, the guy might feel that the author is rejecting him because he's trans, which could be a sensitive issue. \n\nBut the key here is that the author wasn't told upfront about the guy being trans. If the guy hadn't disclosed it until the moment of intimacy, the author might feel that crucial information was withheld, which affects their ability to make an informed decision about the relationship. In relationships, both parties need to share important information that affects the nature of the relationship. If one party withholds such information, the other is within their rights to reassess the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they were not informed in a timely manner, and their personal preferences are valid. The guy's anger seems to stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted to the person in the way they expected. The author's decision to not pursue a romantic relationship isn't malicious; it's based on their own feelings and the lack of prior disclosure. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
