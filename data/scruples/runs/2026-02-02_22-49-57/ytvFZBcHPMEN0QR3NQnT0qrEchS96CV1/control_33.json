He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they discovered their crush is trans and then lost attraction, leading to a falling out. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, then developed a romantic relationship. They were engaging in intimate acts, and during a moment of physical intimacy, the author realized the person wasn't cisgender male. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until that moment, which the author feels was a lie. The author is straight and now doesn't feel attracted, leading to the end of the relationship and some conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider ethical standards, social norms, and the context provided.\n\nTransparency in relationships is important. The trans person didn't disclose their identity, which the author found significant. But maybe the trans person had reasons for not disclosing earlier, such as fear of rejection or not wanting to share before the relationship was more established. However, the author argues that the person had months to tell them and instead pursued a romantic relationship, which made them feel lied to.\n\nThe author is not rejecting the person for being trans, but because they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's a personal preference, not a moral failing. The author wants to remain friends but the other person is upset and hostile, even calling them names. The author isn't trying to hurt them; they're following their feelings.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, people have the right to know about significant aspects of a partner's identity. However, it's also possible that the trans person didn't feel safe or ready to disclose. But the author's reaction is about personal attraction, which is valid. They aren't being bigoted but are acknowledging their own sexuality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They acted based on their feelings and discovered the truth during intimacy, which is a sensitive situation. They didn't know beforehand, and their response is about their own attraction, not discrimination. The trans person's anger might be more about the hurt feelings from rejection, but the author isn't at fault for their lack of attraction. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
