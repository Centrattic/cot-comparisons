He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they became close friends with someone they found attractive, and things escalated into a romantic relationship. During a moment of intimacy, they discovered the person is trans, specifically assigned female at birth but presenting as male. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier, even though they had been friends for months. They clarify they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. Now the person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nI need to consider several angles here. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings. Attraction is a personal thing and can't be controlled. The key issue is whether the trans person withheld information. However, trans people have the right to self-identify without being outed unless they choose to. The author might have expected the person to come out earlier, but it's not clear if the trans person felt it was necessary or safe to do so at that time.\n\nIn many cultures, someone's gender identity is considered a personal matter unless it's relevant. In a romantic context, some people do share such information early on, but it's not required. The author's reaction is about their own lack of attraction, which is valid. But the trans person might feel hurt that the attraction disappeared upon learning about their identity.\n\nThe author isn't being malicious by not continuing the relationship. They're not in the wrong for their feelings. However, the way they handled the situation could be better. They could have been more empathetic instead of feeling lied to. The trans person might have felt the need to wait until a certain point to share, perhaps due to fear of rejection or other reasons. \n\nThe author's main mistake might be not understanding that the trans person didn't have an obligation to disclose earlier and that their own reaction could seem dismissive of the person's identity. But the core question is about being in the wrong. Since the author isn't forcing the relationship or being discriminatory, their actions aren't malicious. They're just dealing with personal feelings. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their feelings, and the trans person's decision to disclose when they did is their choice. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if the attraction is gone. However, the way they communicate this could be more considerate, but that doesn't make them an asshole.\n"
