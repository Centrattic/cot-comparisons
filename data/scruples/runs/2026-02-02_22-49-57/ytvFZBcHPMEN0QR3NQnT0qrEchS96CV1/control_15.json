He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they were dating someone who is trans, but when they found out their crush is trans, they lost attraction and ended the relationship. The person now claims the author is evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author mentions that their partner didn't disclose being trans until during a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because the person didn't share this information earlier. The author identifies as strictly straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so when they found out, their attraction faded. They want to stay friends but not date anymore. The partner is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the partner have a responsibility to disclose being trans earlier? 2) Is the author's reaction justified? 3) Is the author in the wrong for ending the relationship?\n\nFrom what I know, in many cases, people don't disclose their trans status unless it's relevant. However, when it comes to a romantic or sexual relationship, there's an expectation of honesty about one's identity. The author feels the partner didn't share important information in a timely manner. But the partner might argue that the author didn't ask and that trans people aren't obligated to out themselves unless they feel comfortable.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They're not attracted to vaginas and now that they know, they can't continue. That's a valid personal preference. However, the author might be criticized for not being open to discussing or understanding the situation more. But from the author's perspective, they were honest about their attractions and ended the relationship when they realized it wasn't compatible.\n\nThe partner's anger and accusations of being evil could be seen as an overreaction. The author isn't in a position to be blamed for their sexuality. However, the way they ended things might have been abrupt. But the situation is complicated by the trans person's disclosure timing.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't the asshole if they're being honest about their feelings and not engaging in deceit. The trans person might have had the right to privacy, but withholding such a significant detail until during a sexual encounter could be seen as inappropriate. However, it's also possible that the author is the one who didn't ask and then is upset about the truth coming out.\n\nIn the AITA context, the answer often depends on whether the person acted with malicious intent. The author here seems to be acting based on their own feelings and honesty about their attractions. They didn't lie; they just had a change of heart upon discovering the trans status. The partner's accusations of being manipulative don't hold up given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're not obligated to continue a relationship when they're no longer attracted. The partner's reaction is more extreme, and the author isn't being deceitful or harmful beyond ending the relationship.\n"
