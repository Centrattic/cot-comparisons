He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author had a crush on someone they met at art school. They became close friends and started a romantic relationship. The author didn't realize the person they were dating is trans. When they found out during a moment of intimacy, the author felt lied to because the person didn't disclose that information earlier. The author is now less attracted to the person and wants to remain friends but not pursue a relationship. The person is upset and called the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't come out before the relationship became physical. The author feels it's a big deal because they wanted a penis, and the trans person didn't mention their identity. But maybe the trans person felt they couldn't come out earlier, or maybe they thought it wasn't important. \n\nThe author is being asked if they're in the wrong. From the author's perspective, they feel they were lied to. They value honesty in relationships and this information was withheld, leading to a loss of attraction. However, trans individuals often struggle with when and how to disclose their identity. If the person they're dating is trans and presents as male, it's possible they were open about their identity but the author didn't realize it. Or maybe they were waiting for the right time to come out.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, both parties have the right to know each other's identities. The author might feel that essential information was missing, affecting their ability to consent to a relationship. On the other hand, the trans person might have felt it was the right time to come out when they felt ready. The author's reaction might be seen as respecting their own boundaries, even if it hurt the other person's feelings. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the trans person didn't come out before the relationship became intimate, maybe they were in the wrong for not disclosing something important. However, the author's reaction is based on their own preferences. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their attraction. But maybe the author should have considered that the trans person had a valid reason for not disclosing earlier. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require disclosure of gender identity. If the trans person didn't share that information, they might have violated the author's right to informed consent. The author's feelings are valid because they were misled about a significant aspect of the person's identity. However, the author could have been more understanding if the trans person had their own reasons for not coming out sooner. \n\nBut the author is not the one who withheld information. The trans person didn't tell them. The author's decision to end the relationship is about their own attraction, which is a personal choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue a relationship where they aren't attracted. They are not manipulative for being honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't the one who lied. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They had the right to know about the other person's identity to make an informed decision about their relationship. The trans person may have failed to disclose that information in a timely manner, leading to the author's loss of attraction. The author's reaction is a personal choice based on their preferences and isn't malicious.\n"
