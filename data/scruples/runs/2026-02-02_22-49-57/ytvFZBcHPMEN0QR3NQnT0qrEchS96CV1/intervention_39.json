He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their trans crush after finding out they're trans. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, and then started a romantic relationship. The author discovers their crush is trans during a moment of intimacy and feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight, not attracted to vaginas, and now doesn't want to pursue a relationship, leading to conflict where the crush is upset and accuses them of being manipulative.\n\nSo, the main issue is about disclosure and timing. Did the trans person have an obligation to disclose their trans status sooner? In many cases, people don't feel the need to immediately share all personal details, especially if it's not directly relevant to the relationship's progression. However, for some, gender identity is a significant aspect they want to share early on. The author felt that since the trans person didn't mention it during the months of friendship and dating, it felt like a lie, which is understandable given the context of their attraction preferences.\n\nThe author's reaction: they stopped the relationship, want to remain friends, and are now facing accusations from the trans person. The author is questioning their own rightness. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, it's important to note that being transgender is a valid identity, and people shouldn't face discrimination. However, the author's stance is about personal attraction, which is subjective. They aren't discriminating but are honest about their preferences. The author didn't know beforehand, which complicates matters. \n\nThe trans person's approach to disclosure is key here. If they felt comfortable sharing their identity months later during intimacy, maybe they had reasons. But waiting until a sexual situation to disclose something that affects the other person's attraction could be seen as inconsiderate. However, it's also possible the trans person was trying to be a friend first and didn't want to rush into sharing that detail. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to be honest about their feelings. They did that by stopping the interaction and explaining their stance. The accusations of being manipulative from the trans person are unfair, but reactions can be emotional in such situations. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship if the attraction is gone. Preferences aren't something people can control, and the author is being honest. However, some might argue that the trans person should have been more upfront earlier. But since the author's attraction is a personal choice, they aren't wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is not in the wrong. They're being honest about their feelings and preferences, even though the situation is unfortunate. The trans person's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't make the author an asshole for ending the relationship.\n"
