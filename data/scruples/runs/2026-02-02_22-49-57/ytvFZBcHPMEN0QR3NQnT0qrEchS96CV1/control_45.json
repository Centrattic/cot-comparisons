He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for finding out their crush is transgender and then not being attracted to them anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and then developed a romantic relationship. They were engaging in intimate activities, and during a moment when they were about to have sex, the author discovered that their partner was trans. The author then stopped the interaction, felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this information earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The partner is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author didn't know their partner was trans until the moment of intimacy, they felt it was a lie, and they ended the relationship. The partner is now upset and seems to be acting out emotionally.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The trans partner didn't disclose their status early on. While gender identity is a personal matter, in a romantic relationship, especially one moving towards a sexual relationship, it's reasonable for the author to need that information to make an informed decision about their level of intimacy. However, the author's reaction might be influenced by their own preferences and the timing of disclosure.\n\nBut wait, the author also mentions that the trans partner had months to tell them. The author might feel that withholding such a significant detail affected their ability to consent to a sexual relationship. However, the trans partner might have felt vulnerable or unsure about disclosure, or perhaps they thought it wasn't necessary until later.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own feelings of being lied to, which is a common reaction when someone feels that important information wasn't shared. The author is not in the wrong for feeling that way, especially if they consider that information crucial. The author's decision to end the romantic aspect but remain friends could be seen as reasonable, given their lack of attraction now that they know the gender aspect.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction might also be influenced by their own biases. If the author isn't attracted to people assigned male at birth who transitioned, that's a personal preference, and it's not wrong to have such preferences. The problem is whether the trans partner withheld information. But the author didn't ask directly, and the trans partner might have felt it was their right to choose when to disclose.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being malicious. They're reacting to their own feelings and preferences. The trans partner's anger and accusations of being evil and manipulative seem disproportionate, which might indicate that they're hurt and defensive. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone after discovering their trans identity, as attraction is subjective and personal. The author's choice to end the relationship is a matter of personal preference, not a moral failing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with personal preferences and the situation as it unfolded, and their reaction isn't malicious. The trans partner's anger is more about their own feelings of rejection and possibly feeling invalidated.\n"
