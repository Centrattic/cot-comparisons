He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a crush on someone who turned out to be trans, and upon finding out, lost their attraction. They stopped the relationship, and the other person is upset, calling them names. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. They didn't know the person was trans until the moment they almost had sex. The other person didn't disclose their trans identity until that point. The author feels like they were lied to because the person didn't tell them earlier. The key points here are consent, disclosure, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is wrong. The person being trans is a significant part of their identity, and the author considers that important for attraction. The trans person didn't disclose this, which the author feels is a lie. But was there a lie? The person might not have seen it as deceptive if they presented as male and didn't correct the assumption. However, withholding such a significant detail that affects the author's feelings and the nature of the relationship might be a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable if they're not attracted to women. They didn't want to continue the relationship after the fact, which is their right. However, the author also had a romantic relationship with someone they thought was male. The trans person might have felt that their identity was a crucial part of their self-presentation, and the author's rejection after the fact could be hurtful. But the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina; that's a personal preference.\n\nThe trans person's anger and calling the author names might be an overreaction, but the author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious. They're stating their truth. The key here is that the trans person didn't disclose their identity, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. The author isn't responsible for the trans person's identity, but the trans person's withholding information might be the root of the problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they can't change their sexual orientation. The issue is more about the other person's lack of disclosure. Therefore, Answer B is correct.\n"
