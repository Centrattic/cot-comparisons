He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The person met someone they liked, they became friends, and then started dating. The key issue is that the author found out their crush is trans, and because they're strictly straight, their attraction faded. They feel like they were lied to because the other person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. Now the other person is upset and called the author names like evil and manipulative. The author is confused about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the trans person's perspective. Transitioning is a big deal, and some people might not disclose until they're comfortable or if it's relevant. But in a dating context, especially when it comes to physical intimacy, not disclosing could be seen as a problem. However, it's also important to note that being trans is part of someone's identity, and whether someone chooses to share that is up to them. But if they're in a relationship moving towards a serious level, withholding such a significant detail might be an issue.\n\nThe author mentions feeling lied to. But was it a lie? If the trans person presented as male and lived as male, then in a sense, they are a man. The author's issue is with the physical aspect\u2014expecting a penis and not finding one. But the trans person might have medical reasons for not having a penis. The author's rejection is based on attraction, which is a personal preference. They can't help that they're not into vaginas, but they also might not have considered how the trans person felt about being rejected.\n\nThe author stopped the interaction and explained their feelings. They want to remain friends but not pursue a relationship. The other person is upset and called them names. The author is defensive, saying they're not in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nLegally and ethically, people have the right to their sexuality and preferences. The author isn't wrong for not being attracted to someone. However, there's a nuance here. The trans person might have withheld information that could have affected the author's decision. But it's also possible the author didn't ask about such things because they were focused on the emotional connection. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points.\n\nBut the author isn't being malicious. They tried to be honest about their feelings. The trans person's reaction of calling them evil and manipulative seems harsh and possibly a defense mechanism. The author's main issue is attraction, which is a personal choice. They didn't force the relationship; they stopped when they realized. So, considering all that, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They're not being an asshole for having a preference they can't control. However, there's a responsibility to communicate, but in this case, the author did communicate their feelings after the fact. The other person's reaction is more concerning.\n"
