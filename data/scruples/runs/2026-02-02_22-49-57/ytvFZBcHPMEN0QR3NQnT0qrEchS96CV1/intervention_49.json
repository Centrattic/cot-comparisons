He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction. The situation involves a romantic relationship that started as a friendship. The key points are: the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, the author felt lied to, and now there's conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The trans person might have had their reasons for not disclosing early, maybe fear of rejection or not being ready. But when building a romantic relationship, certain personal details are important. The author felt that not knowing this changed their attraction, which is valid for some people. The author isn't being offensive; they're stating their preference.\n\nThen, there's the part where the trans person is angry and calls the author names. That seems unfair. The author didn't hide their attraction before the relationship escalated. The trans person might have assumed the author would accept them regardless of gender, but that's a personal expectation. The author's reaction is about their own feelings, not a rejection of the person's identity. \n\nAlso, the trans person's anger and accusations (like calling the author a sociopath) indicate they're hurt, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The author is being honest about their feelings. They're not in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. \n\nSocietal perspectives matter here. Some might argue the trans person should have been more upfront, but others might say the author should accept them regardless. However, the author's response is about their personal comfort and preferences. They're not being malicious; they're just not attracted to vaginas. The key is mutual respect. The author didn't act in a harmful way; they're honest about their feelings. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
