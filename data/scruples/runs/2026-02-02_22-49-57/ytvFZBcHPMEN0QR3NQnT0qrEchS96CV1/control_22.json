He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person started going to art school, met a guy who they found attractive and they became close friends. They developed a romantic relationship, spending time together, making out, cuddling, etc. Then during a moment where they were about to have sex, the author noticed that the guy didn't have a penis and found out he was trans. The author feels lied to because the guy didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The guy is upset and called the author evil and manipulative. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author is straight and their attraction is based on the guy having a penis. They didn't know he was trans until the moment they were about to have sex. The guy didn't disclose his trans status earlier, which the author sees as a lie. The author then decided not to continue the relationship, leading to the guy's anger.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's argument is that they were not informed of a key aspect that affects their attraction. The guy's argument is that he was honest eventually, but maybe didn't disclose earlier. But when is the right time to disclose such information? In a romantic relationship, people usually share personal details over time. If the author is straight, then their attraction is based on the gender of the partner. The guy, being trans, identifies as male, but his anatomy is different. The author might not have been aware of his trans status from the start.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong for the guy to not disclose his trans status? It's possible that the guy felt vulnerable about sharing that information and waited until he felt more comfortable. However, if the author's attraction is based on the gender assigned at birth, then not knowing could be a dealbreaker. On the other hand, the author's reaction after finding out might be abrupt. They stopped the relationship, leading to the guy feeling hurt.\n\nBut the author is not in the wrong for being straight. Sexual orientation is about who someone is attracted to. If the author isn't attracted to people with vaginas, then they can't be blamed for not continuing the relationship. The guy might have a right to be upset if he felt the author didn't give him a chance to explain earlier, but the author isn't required to stay in a relationship that doesn't align with their attractions. Also, the guy's reaction of calling the author evil seems overly harsh. The author is honest about their feelings and wants to remain friends, which isn't malicious.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The decision to end the relationship is based on personal attraction, which is valid. The guy might have handled his trans status differently, but the author isn't responsible for that. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
