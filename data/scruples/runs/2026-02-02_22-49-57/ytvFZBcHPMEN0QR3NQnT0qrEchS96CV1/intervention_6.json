He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's crush is trans, and they lost attraction upon finding out. The author is being accused by the crush of being evil and manipulative. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, so they want to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and honesty. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, but the author found out during a moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to because the person didn't share this important information before moving into a physical relationship. \n\nBut wait, the trans person might have been waiting for the right time or feared rejection if they had come out earlier. However, the author's perspective is that this information was crucial for their attraction. Since the author is straight, they don't feel attracted to a vagina. So the issue is about honesty versus attraction.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to know important details about each other. If one person is trans and hasn't had that conversation before a physical relationship, it might be a problem. The author stopped the interaction when they realized, which shows they respected the person's identity. They also want to remain friends. \n\nThe trans person is upset, but the author isn't rejecting them as a person, just their attraction. It's about preference, not discrimination. The author isn't in the wrong for not feeling the same after the fact. They should have had that conversation earlier, but the trans person didn't share it. However, the author isn't the one who withheld information. The author's actions are about their own feelings, not a malicious intent.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with their own feelings and preferences, and it's okay to not be attracted even if the person is trans. The key is that the author is honest about their feelings and wants to maintain friendship.\n"
