He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a crush who is trans, and the author stops being attracted after finding out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developing a romantic relationship. The author didn't know the person was trans, and when they found out during a moment of intimacy, they felt lied to. The trans person didn't disclose this information earlier, which the author felt was important.\n\nThe author's main issue is about attraction\u2014being strictly straight and not finding the trans person attractive. They feel the trans person should have mentioned it earlier. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know the person was trans; they were in a relationship based on the information they had. The trans person didn't disclose their identity, which could be a problem. But is the author wrong for changing their feelings after discovering this? Attraction is a personal thing, and it's not necessarily wrong to feel that way. However, the author needs to consider if the trans person felt safe to disclose earlier. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction might be seen as invalidating the trans person's experience. The trans person might have struggled with coming out. But the author is also not obligated to continue a relationship if their attraction is based on the person's gender identity. \n\nThe author is in the right to have their preferences. However, the way they reacted might be seen as harsh. But in terms of being in the wrong, since the author didn't know and attraction is subjective, they might not be at fault. The trans person should have communicated their identity earlier if it was a critical factor. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
