He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone, developed a friendship, and things became romantic. They didn't know the person was trans until an intimate moment. The person didn't disclose this information earlier, and the author feels lied to. The author is now not attracted anymore and wants to stay friends but not pursue a relationship. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering this. The author explains they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. They feel it's important information that wasn't shared. The trans person didn't come out earlier, which led to the author feeling misled. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is crucial in relationships. If the trans person didn't disclose their identity before becoming intimate, that could be a problem. The author had the right to know before getting physically involved, especially since the person is trans. The author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation, which is valid. It's their personal preference, so they can't be wrong for not being attracted. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations seem misplaced. The author isn't in the wrong for not continuing a relationship if the core issue is attraction. The trans person should have been honest earlier to avoid this situation. The author isn't manipulating anyone; they're acting on their feelings and preferences. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The key points are the lack of disclosure leading to the author's feelings of being lied to and the author's right to their sexual orientation.\n"
