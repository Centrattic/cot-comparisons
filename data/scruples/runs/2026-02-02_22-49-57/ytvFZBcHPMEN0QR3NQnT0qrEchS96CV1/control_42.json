He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a romantic relationship that ended when the writer discovered their crush is transgender, leading to a loss of attraction and subsequent conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The writer mentions that they were in a relationship with a trans guy, and after finding out he's trans, they lost attraction. They feel they were misled because he didn't disclose this earlier. The trans person became upset, calling the writer evil and manipulative, which adds tension.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the writer is at fault. From what I know, being transgender is a part of someone's identity. However, the timeline of disclosure is important. The trans person didn't come out as trans until the moment when the situation became intimate. The writer argues that the trans person had months to disclose this information but didn't, which led to the writer feeling lied to.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty in relationships is crucial. If one partner withholds significant information that affects the other's feelings or the nature of the relationship, it can be seen as a breach of trust. However, it's also important to consider the trans person's perspective. Coming out can be a difficult and vulnerable process. Maybe the trans person wasn't ready to share that part of his identity yet, or perhaps he thought it was irrelevant to the budding relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer's reaction is to lose attraction once they knew. The writer is being honest about their preferences, stating they are strictly straight. That's their right, and it's not their fault for feeling that way. However, the way they framed their reaction might be seen as invalidating the trans person's identity, especially if the trans person had trusted them and built a friendship over months.\n\nBut the writer isn't shaming the trans person for being trans; they're stating that their attraction is based on physical characteristics. It's important to differentiate between rejecting the person's identity and rejecting them personally. The writer is rejecting the latter, which is their choice, but the trans person's reaction seems extreme, accusing the writer of being evil. That might indicate his own issues with handling rejection, possibly as a way to deflect from his own vulnerability.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the trans person didn't disclose his trans status in a timely manner, which led to the writer feeling misled. However, the writer is not at fault for being honest about their attraction. The trans person's hostile reaction is the real issue here. The writer's actions are not malicious; they're following their feelings. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
