He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a person who found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup and some conflict. The author is feeling confused and is questioning if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their crush were friends for months, then started dating, and things were progressing towards a sexual relationship. The author discovered during intimacy that the crush is trans, leading to a loss of attraction. The crush is now upset, calling the author names. The author feels they were lied to because the crush didn't disclose being trans earlier.\n\nThe main issue here is disclosure and timing. The author feels that the crush didn't share important information about their gender identity until a critical moment. However, gender identity is a personal aspect, and when to disclose it can depend on the individual's comfort. The crush might have been waiting for the right time or felt it wasn't necessary until they were more certain of their feelings.\n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a valid orientation. The crush, being trans, might identify as male, but the author's attraction is limited to penises. The author is now in a position where they can't reconcile this, leading to the end of the relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after learning this.\n\nFrom a standpoint of ethics and relationships, people have the right to their own attractions and preferences. The author isn't obligated to change their feelings. However, the timing of the disclosure is a point of contention. The crush waited until the moment before intimacy to reveal this, which the author found shocking. The author might feel that if the crush had been honest earlier, they could have made a different decision.\n\nBut gender identity disclosure is a sensitive topic. Some trans individuals might not disclose early on for various reasons\u2014fear of rejection, uncertainty in their own identity, or not wanting to be judged. It's also possible that the crush didn't see it as relevant until the relationship became sexual. The author, on the other hand, views it as essential information that should have been known sooner.\n\nThe crush's reaction is also concerning. Calling the author evil and manipulative seems like an overreaction and could indicate poor conflict resolution skills. However, the author's decision to end the romantic relationship due to a lack of attraction isn't malicious; it's based on personal preference.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans if they identify as straight. People are allowed to have attractions to certain bodies. The issue might lie in the crush's decision to wait until intimacy to disclose their gender, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author wants to maintain a friendship but the crush is upset. The author is struggling with whether they're being unfair. The key here is that the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing a relationship due to lack of attraction. The crush's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not being accepted, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They acted according to their own feelings and preferences, and they're not obligated to continue a relationship that no longer aligns with their attractions. The crush's reaction, while valid in feeling hurt, doesn't place blame on the author.\n"
