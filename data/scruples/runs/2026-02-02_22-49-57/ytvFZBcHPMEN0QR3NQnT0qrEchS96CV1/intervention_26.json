He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they discovered their crush is transgender and then lost attraction, leading to the end of their romantic relationship. The author is now being accused by the trans person of being evil and manipulative, which is making them question their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and the crush were friends for months before developing a romantic relationship, which included physical intimacy but didn't go all the way. The author found out during a moment when they were about to have sex that the crush is trans. The author is straight and specifically attracted to penises, so the lack of a penis led to a loss of attraction. They wanted to stay friends but not pursue anything more, which upset the crush.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the trans identity. The author isn't condemning or being cruel; they're expressing that they are not attracted to vaginas and are strict about their preferences. However, they're framing it as the crush \"lying\" or not disclosing this information earlier. The trans person, on the other hand, might have felt that their gender was not a secret and that it's inappropriate to be asked to reveal such personal information early on in a relationship, especially if they already identified as male to the author.\n\nIn many cases, people's gender identity is a personal matter that they choose to disclose when they feel comfortable. It's not a common practice to ask someone about their genitalia until the relationship is quite advanced, especially in a casual dating context. The author's assumption that the crush should have disclosed this earlier might stem from a misunderstanding of how gender identity is perceived and shared. Additionally, the author's reaction led to the end of the relationship, which is a personal choice based on their preferences. However, the way the author approached the situation\u2014stopping immediately and possibly making the crush feel rejected\u2014might come off as harsh, especially if the crush was not expecting that reaction.\n\nThe accusations from the crush, like calling the author evil or manipulative, could be a result of feeling hurt and rejected, perhaps due to internalized stigma or fear of not being accepted. But the author isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences and not wanting to pursue a relationship. It's important to recognize that attraction is personal and can't be controlled. The problem arises if there was a deliberate misrepresentation of gender identity, but if the crush was open about being trans at some point, then the author might not have been lied to.\n\nAlso, the author wants to maintain the friendship, which shows they care about the person's feelings. The trans person's anger might be more about feeling invalidated or rejected rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship, but they might need to reflect on how they communicated their feelings and whether they gave the crush a chance to disclose this information earlier if that was a factor in their decision. However, since the author is straight and the crush is trans, the lack of attraction is a natural outcome, not a moral failing.\n"
