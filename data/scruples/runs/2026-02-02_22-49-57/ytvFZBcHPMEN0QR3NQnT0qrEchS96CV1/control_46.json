He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one person discovers their partner is transgender and subsequently loses interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Being transgender is a personal identity, and the individual's right to self-identify is important. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after this discovery.\n\nThe key points from the story: The author and their crush became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and during a moment of intimacy, the author discovered their partner is trans. The author feels lied to because the partner didn't disclose this information earlier. The author identifies as straight and is not attracted to vaginas, so they can't move past this. The partner is upset and calls the author names, leading the author to question their own actions.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and ethical standards. People have the right to their own preferences in relationships. The author isn't being judged for their sexual orientation, so it's not wrong to be straight. However, the issue here is whether the trans person withheld information that's relevant to the relationship. The partner didn't disclose their gender identity, which the author considers important for attraction. \n\nBut, from a trans rights perspective, it's important to respect their identity and the process they went through to disclose it. The partner might have been waiting for the right time to share this, especially if it's a sensitive topic. The author might not have been ready to hear it before, or maybe the partner was anxious about rejection. However, in a relationship where intimacy is occurring, certain information becomes relevant for both partners to know. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on their personal preferences, which are valid. However, the way they ended the relationship might come off as abrupt and hurtful, especially if the partner felt they were being rejected solely because of their trans identity. The author's friend called them names, which is a red flag, suggesting possible emotional manipulation or instability. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having their own preferences and deciding that the relationship isn't compatible. But there might be a responsibility to communicate boundaries earlier if certain aspects are deal-breakers. The author might have a responsibility to consider if their partner felt ready to disclose their identity, especially in a situation of intimacy. \n\nThe partner's reaction being angry and calling the author names could indicate that there were other issues at play, possibly not entirely about being trans. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious if it's based on their genuine feelings and preferences. However, the manner in which it was handled could be seen as insensitive if the partner was not prepared for that information to be revealed in that context. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's preferences are valid, but the situation might be more about mismatched expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to their attraction preferences, but there might be room for empathy towards the partner's feelings and the process of disclosing their identity.\n"
