He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were dating someone who is trans, and when they found out that their crush is trans, they lost attraction and ended the relationship. The person is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author mentions that they found out their crush is trans during a moment when they were about to have sex. They were friends for months, developing a romantic relationship. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so when they found out the person is trans (assuming male-to-female), they lost interest. The trans person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which the author finds confusing because they thought the friendship was real.\n\nSo, the key points are: the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier. The author felt lied to because it was revealed during an intimate moment. The author isn't attracted to trans women (assuming that's the case here, since the author is straight and the person transitioned). The trans person is upset because the author ended the relationship after the disclosure.\n\nNow, considering the societal context, people in the LGBTQ+ community often face challenges with disclosure and being authentic. However, in relationships, honesty and communication are important. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to come out, perhaps due to fear of rejection or personal reasons. But if the author is strictly straight, maybe the trans person should have been honest earlier when the relationship was becoming romantic. However, the author didn't know until that moment, so maybe it's not their fault.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The main question is whether it's wrong to lose attraction after finding out someone is trans. Since the author is straight, their attraction is based on the gender of the person. However, some people's attraction can be to the gender presentation, not the biological sex. But the author clearly states they are not attracted to vaginas and want a penis. So, if the person they were with is trans female, they have a penis, but the author didn't notice it until that moment. Wait, but if the person is trans female (assigned male at birth), they would have a penis unless they've had surgery. So the author found out that there was no penis (maybe the person had surgery?), but the author assumed that the person was male. But the trans person is female, so the author's assumption was incorrect.\n\nBut the author is now saying that since they are straight, they aren't attracted to trans women. However, some people in the trans community might feel that being trans is still a woman to them, so the author's stance could be seen as discriminatory. But the author isn't being offensive, they just state their preference. The author isn't in the wrong for having certain attractions. People have different preferences, and being straight typically means being attracted to the opposite sex, but that can vary per individual. So, the author isn't wrong for not being attracted to trans women if that's their preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might feel that the author is invalidating their identity by ending the relationship after finding out. The author's reaction could be seen as a rejection based on gender identity, but the author isn't rejecting the person as a person, just their physical attributes. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling that the author didn't respect their identity or didn't give them a chance to disclose earlier. But the author didn't know until that moment, so it's a situation where both parties may have valid points.\n\nHowever, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are: did the trans person disclose their gender identity earlier? The author says they had months to tell the truth. If the trans person didn't disclose, maybe they should have been honest earlier. But sometimes people struggle with when and how to come out, especially in a romantic context. The author also mentions that maybe if the trans person had told them earlier, they could have overcome it. But since it was revealed at that intimate moment, the author is left confused and hurt.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions after finding out, ending the relationship because of a lack of attraction is understandable. The author isn't forcing the relationship; they're being honest about their feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing a relationship based on a lack of attraction. However, the way they ended it might be considered harsh if it wasn't handled with care. But the author seems to express that they want to continue being friends, which is a positive step.\n\nThe trans person's reaction of calling the author an evil, manipulative person seems excessive and possibly an attempt to deflect or hurt the author. That might indicate that the trans person is struggling with their own emotions and not handling the rejection well. The author isn't responsible for the trans person's emotional response.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their own preferences and are honest about their attractions. The trans person might be at fault for not disclosing their identity earlier, but the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship after discovering something that affects their attraction. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
