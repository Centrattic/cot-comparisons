He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. First, I need to understand the situation. They were friends, developed feelings, started dating, and then during a near-sex encounter, discovered the person wasn't cisgender. Now they feel lied to because the trans person didn't disclose earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they're conflicted.\n\nThe key points here are attraction, honesty, and communication. The trans person didn't mention being trans before the relationship became physical. The author feels it was withheld, which is a big deal for them. But is the author wrong for ending the relationship? Well, being trans isn't a lie if it's due to identity and not deception. However, not disclosing such a major aspect before intimacy might be an issue for the trans person. \n\nThe author's reaction is about their own preferences. They're not wrong for being attracted to men. The trans person might have been planning to come out eventually, but the timing was when intimacy was happening. The author's feelings are valid. They didn't force the trans person to stay in a relationship; they ended it because of their own attraction. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. So, answer B.\n"
