He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's crush is trans, and upon finding out, the author is no longer attracted and ended the relationship. The author is feeling guilty, thinking they might be in the wrong for not continuing the relationship even though they're straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person in the story is trans and didn't disclose their gender identity until a very intimate moment. The author feels like they were lied to, but trans people often choose when and how to share their identity, especially in relationships. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a valid preference. The problem arises because the author didn't know beforehand, leading to a sudden realization that changed their feelings.\n\nNow, in terms of ethics, the main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The author's argument is that they like the person as a friend but aren't attracted to them now that they know. The trans person is upset, feeling that the author is rejecting them, but the author isn't in the wrong for having preferences and realizing the relationship isn't viable. The author is also not obligated to continue a romantic relationship if their attraction is gone.\n\nAnother angle is the trans person's responsibility to disclose their identity. While some people might choose to share early on, others might wait, especially if they're not sure how the other person would react. However, withholding such a significant detail that affects the other person's feelings might be seen as a miscommunication. But it's also important to note that being trans is not a choice and it's a part of their identity. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating that, but their attraction is a personal matter.\n\nThe author's feelings are genuine. They liked the person as a friend and even developed a romantic attraction, but the revelation changed things. Ending a relationship because of a change in attraction isn't malicious. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their feelings, even if it's painful for the other person. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill a romantic role if they're not interested.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision based on their preferences and feelings, which is a personal choice. The answer should be B.\n"
