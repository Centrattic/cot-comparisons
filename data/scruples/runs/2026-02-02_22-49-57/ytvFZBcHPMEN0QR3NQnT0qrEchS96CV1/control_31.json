He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer had a crush on someone they thought was cisgender male, but found out the person is trans (so they were assigned female at birth but identify as male). The writer then lost attraction and wanted to stop the relationship, which made the other person upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The writer mentions they only realized the person was trans when they were about to have sex and noticed the absence of a penis. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The writer feels lied to because they think it's important information that should have been shared earlier. They also mention they are straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they can't overcome that. Now the trans person is angry and called them names like evil and manipulative, which the writer finds confusing and hurtful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The trans person's responsibility: they didn't disclose their trans status early on. Depending on the situation, when someone is in a romantic/sexual relationship, they might expect to know such personal information before intimacy. However, disclosure timing can vary. Some trans people choose when to disclose based on their comfort. The writer, on the other hand, thinks it's a deal-breaker because of their preferences. \n\nThe writer stopped the interaction when they found out, which is their right. They also want to continue the friendship, which is respectful. The trans person's anger seems disproportionate and possibly hurtful. If the trans person had been open about being trans earlier, maybe the writer could have processed it and decided if they wanted to continue. But since the disclosure happened at such a critical moment, the writer's reaction is understandable.\n\nNow, considering if the writer is in the wrong. They didn't lie or manipulate. They had feelings, found out a key detail, and adjusted their feelings accordingly. The trans person might have withheld information, but the writer can't be blamed for their lack of attraction. Being in the wrong would mean they acted unethically or disrespectfully. The writer tried to be honest and wants to stay friends. The trans person's anger and accusations are more about their own hurt feelings than the writer's actions. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The writer isn't at fault for not wanting to continue the relationship after learning a significant detail that affects their attraction. They didn't act maliciously and tried to handle the situation respectfully.\n"
