He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the narrator discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions they were in a relationship with someone they later found out is trans. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for feeling that the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity early enough, leading to the author's loss of attraction and subsequent decision to end the romantic aspect. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative, while the author feels they were misled.\n\nImportant factors here include consent, disclosure, and mutual understanding in relationships. The author states that the trans person had known they were trans for months but didn't disclose it until the situation escalated. The author feels this was a lie or omission, which is significant because it's a fundamental aspect of identity that can affect the relationship's direction. However, the trans person might have felt safe enough to share later, or perhaps the author didn't ask directly. \n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to their own attractions and preferences. Being straight is a valid orientation, and the author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone regardless of their gender identity. The trans person's decision to disclose when they did is their choice, but withholding such a significant detail for months before a sexual encounter could be seen as a problem, especially if it was a deal-breaker for the author.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the romantic relationship but wants to remain friends. The trans person's anger and accusations (calling the author evil) might be an overreaction, possibly due to feeling rejected or invalidated. However, the author isn't the one who chose to end the relationship; the trans person might be projecting their hurt onto the author.\n\nLegally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to continue a relationship based on their attractions. The trans person's disclosure timing could be questioned, but it's not inherently deceitful unless there was an intent to mislead for personal gain. The author's actions don't seem malicious. They're acting based on their feelings and preferences, which are natural.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
