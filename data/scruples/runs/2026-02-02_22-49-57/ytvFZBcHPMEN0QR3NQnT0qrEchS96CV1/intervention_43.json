He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a person (the author) who discovered their crush is transgender and then lost interest, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the person they were dating/dating-equivalent is trans. They found out during a moment of intimacy when they noticed the absence of a penis. The author felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so this changed their feelings. Now the trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. The trans person might have felt they were in a position to be open when they felt comfortable, but the author believes they should have disclosed earlier. There's a question of when and how personal information is shared in relationships. Also, the author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation, which is a valid personal preference. However, the trans person's identity is a fundamental part of who they are. \n\nIs the author wrong for ending the relationship? If the person is transgender, they might have been living as their true self for some time before the relationship. If they hadn't disclosed, maybe the author had a right to know before a sexual encounter. But the trans person might have felt unsafe or uncertain about how to bring it up. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on their attraction being tied to having a penis, which is a personal preference but not a choice. However, the way the situation was handled\u2014finding out during intimacy\u2014might have been hurtful. The author didn't know beforehand, so they didn't make a judgment based on the trans status initially. The trans person might have felt that the author was rejecting them because they're trans, but the author is stating it's about attraction. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some accountability. The trans person could have shared their identity when they felt comfortable, but the author also has the right to their preferences. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because their attraction is based on their orientation. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling invalidated or rejected, but the author isn't obligated to be in a relationship if the attraction is gone. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They are following their feelings and orientation, and while communication could have been better, they aren't maliciously rejecting the person for being trans but rather for not being attracted to a vagina.\n"
