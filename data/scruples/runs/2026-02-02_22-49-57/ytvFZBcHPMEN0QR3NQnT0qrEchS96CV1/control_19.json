He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was dating someone they found attractive, but when they discovered that their partner is transgender, their attraction disappeared. The author feels like they were lied to because the partner didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The partner is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, but the author is confused about their own actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Transgender individuals often face societal stigma and may not disclose their status until they feel safe. The author met their partner, they developed a relationship, and the partner didn't mention their trans status until it came up during intimacy. The author feels betrayed because they consider this a significant detail, while the partner might have felt it was their right to self-identify and share when they were comfortable.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after this discovery. The partner's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or invalidated. However, the author's attraction is based on physical characteristics they no longer found appealing, which is a personal preference. The question is whether the author is wrong for having this reaction, or if the partner should have been more transparent earlier.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone has different boundaries and what they consider important in a relationship. The author isn't being discriminatory because they explicitly state they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans partner might have felt that their identity wasn't relevant to the early stages of the relationship, or they might have feared rejection if they disclosed earlier. The author's reaction, while it caused hurt, seems to be based on personal attraction issues rather than prejudice against being trans.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, the partner might have had a duty to disclose if they felt it was necessary for the relationship's continuation, but it's also their right to share personal information at their own pace. The author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone regardless of their identity, and it's not their responsibility to accept a relationship that no longer aligns with their preferences. The partner's anger might be more about their own feelings of rejection or fear of being exposed, but that doesn't make the author wrong for acting on their own feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to end the relationship after discovering something that affects their attraction. They are not being malicious or discriminatory, just acknowledging their personal preferences. The partner's reaction is valid in terms of feeling hurt, but the author's decision is understandable given their expressed orientation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
