She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to stop being friends with her coworker's friend who called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jane) for over three years. The coworker in question is Sam, who waves at the girlfriend but doesn't talk to others. The girlfriend was okay with that initially. Then, the author found out through her Fitbit messages that Jane referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which he takes issue with. The author then tells the girlfriend to cut off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author discovered the message via the girlfriend's Fitbit, which she didn't know. The girlfriend had deleted messages on her phone, but the Fitbit retained them. The author used this to confront her, even though he had previously mentioned they checked each other's phones. The girlfriend's friend made a comment about someone being a \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend ignored. The author then ends the friendship because he feels it's not respectful to him and the relationship.\n\nThe key issues here are trust, boundaries, and overreaction. The author's main problem is the friend calling someone else \"boyfriend.\" Even if it's a joke or common in their workplace, the author is taking it as a personal slight. The girlfriend might have a right to be friends with whoever she wants unless there's a pattern of disrespect. Ending a long-term friendship over a single joke or miscommunication might be too harsh. Also, the method of finding out (using Fitbit to track deleted messages) could affect the trust in their relationship. The author might be overstepping by dictating who she can be friends with based on a minor issue. However, he's also expressing his feelings about being disrespected, which is a valid concern. But cutting off a friend over this seems extreme. So, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A) because he's imposing his views on the girlfriend's friendships without considering her perspective and the context of the workplace culture.\n"
