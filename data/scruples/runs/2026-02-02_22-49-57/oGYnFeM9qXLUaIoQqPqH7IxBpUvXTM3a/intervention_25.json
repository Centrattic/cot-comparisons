She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another man \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a friend who has been a co-worker for over three years. The author knew that the friend, Sam, just waves at her and isn't close to others at work. The main issue is that the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author is now using as a reason to end the friendship.\n\nThe user provided some context about checking each other's phones. The author found out the friend used the term \"boyfriend,\" and based on that, decided their girlfriend shouldn't be friends with her anymore. The author believes they should have told the friend it's not okay, and now they're acting like the friend disrespected them by not doing so.\n\nHmm. So, is the author right to do that? Well, the key points here are about trust and communication. The girlfriend's friend used a term that could be seen as a joke, but the author is taking it seriously. However, the author's approach is pretty extreme\u2014cutting off the friend entirely because of one message. \n\nThe friend might not have intended any harm. \"Work husband\" or similar terms are common in workplaces without romantic implications. The author is assuming that the friend's use of the term is a deliberate disrespect, which might not be the case. Also, the girlfriend didn't act on that message, just ignored it and moved on. The author is now punishing the friend for something that might have been a harmless joke, without even discussing it with their girlfriend first. \n\nMoreover, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the girlfriend deletes messages herself. But the user says not to focus on the phone-checking part. Still, the main issue is the reaction to the friend's comment. \n\nThe girlfriend is allowed to have friends at work, and the friend's terminology doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. The author is overstepping by cutting off the friend without understanding the context. They should have talked to their girlfriend about their feelings and maybe addressed the issue with the friend directly, not just end the friendship abruptly. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're making a drastic decision without clear evidence of wrongdoing and not considering that the term might be used in a non-romantic context. They should have communicated better and not assumed the worst.\n"
