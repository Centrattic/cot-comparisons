She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Friend X) for three years. The boyfriend is okay initially because he's told that the coworker (Sam) only waves at his girlfriend and doesn't talk to others. Then, when the boyfriend finds out that Friend X called another coworker \"boyfriend,\" he decides the friendship should end.\n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries. The boyfriend trusts his girlfriend's initial report about Sam, but when he finds out about the \"boyfriend\" comment, he feels disrespected. But wait, Friend X called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which might just be a joke or slang. The boyfriend assumes that's not okay and cuts off the friend. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's actions might be overreacting. The friend might not have meant anything by the term, especially in a workplace context where \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" are common. The boyfriend is taking it personally, but maybe the friend didn't intend to disrespect him. Also, the girlfriend might not have known her friend would say that, and it's up to her to address it, not the boyfriend cutting off the friend. \n\nAnother aspect is the way the boyfriend found out\u2014through deleted messages on the Fitbit. This suggests he's been checking her phone, which can be a red flag in a relationship. Using a Fitbit to monitor messages might indicate a lack of trust, which can cause issues. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the boyfriend is setting a line by not wanting the friend anymore. But is that fair? The friend's comment might not have been a big deal, and ending the friendship over a joke could be too harsh. The boyfriend is in a position where he should communicate his feelings to his girlfriend and let her handle the situation with her friend, rather than cutting the friend out himself. \n\nSo, the boyfriend is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, which might make him the asshole here. He's overstepping by ending a long-term friendship based on a possibly innocent comment. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not giving his girlfriend the chance to address the issue and is making a unilateral decision to end the friendship without clear justification.\n"
