She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their girlfriend to be friends with her coworker after she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's say Sarah) for three years. The author is okay with the girlfriend interacting with this coworker, Sam, who only talks to her and waves at others. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that there was a message where Sarah referred to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The author confronts the girlfriend, and now he's cutting off the friendship because Sarah doesn't respect him.\n\nThe author's main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" for another man. He believes it's not okay and that the friend shouldn't have made that joke. He's ending the friendship based on that. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not see the term as problematic, maybe considering it innocent workplace banter. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, trust is important. The author went through her phone, which is a red flag in itself. Even if he found out through the Fitbit, the fact that he's controlling her friendships based on a single joke is questionable. The friend might not have intended any disrespect, and cutting off someone over a joke could be seen as overreacting. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in choosing friends is being violated. The author's reaction could be seen as jealousy or insecurity, which isn't healthy in a relationship. However, the author does have a right to feel disrespected if he doesn't like the term. But cutting off the friendship entirely without discussing boundaries with the friend first might be too harsh. The girlfriend could have addressed the friend's comment directly instead of the author taking that step. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's autonomy and the potential innocence of the friend's comment. He's making a judgment based on a single instance without giving the friend a chance to explain or rectify. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's controlling her social life over a minor issue and using the situation to justify his actions, possibly stemming from insecurity rather than a legitimate disrespect towards him.\n"
