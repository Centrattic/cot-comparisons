She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and this coworker (Sam) have been friends for over three years. The author was initially okay with their friendship because the girlfriend told him that Sam doesn't talk to many people and only interacts with her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages. The author discovered this through the Fitbit and forced her to tell about the deleted messages. One of the messages had another coworker referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to cut off the friend, saying she disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider a few angles. \n\n1. **Trust and Communication**: The girlfriend had mentioned that Sam doesn't interact much with others, so the author trusted that. However, the coworker's comment about Sam being her \"boyfriend\" is a problem. But maybe the author overreacted by cutting off the friend entirely just because of that comment. \n\n2. **Ownership and Control**: The author is taking a possessive stance over the girlfriend's friendships. Friends can be complex, and cutting someone off because of a single joke might not be fair unless there's a history of issues. The author seems to be making a judgment based on a friend's joke, not the girlfriend's actual behavior.\n\n3. **Privacy Invasion**: The author used the Fitbit to read messages the girlfriend thought she had deleted. Even if she's hiding stuff, using tech to invade privacy is questionable. This could be a red flag in the relationship, affecting trust.\n\n4. **Communication Approach**: Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe discussing boundaries with the friend would be better. The author is imposing a solution without considering the girlfriend's feelings about losing a friend. \n\n5. **Jealousy vs. Reasoning**: The author is upset about being called a boyfriend by a coworker, but if there's no actual relationship, maybe the issue is more about jealousy. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message, so maybe the friend's comment was innocent. The author's reaction seems harsh given that.\n\nPutting this all together, the author's actions\u2014cutting off the friend without considering other options, using invasive methods to check messages, and not discussing it calmly\u2014make it seem like he's being overly controlling. The friend's comment might be a joke, and the girlfriend's response was to move on. The author's reaction could damage the girlfriend's social life and trust in the relationship. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he's being controlling and not addressing the issue constructively.\n"
