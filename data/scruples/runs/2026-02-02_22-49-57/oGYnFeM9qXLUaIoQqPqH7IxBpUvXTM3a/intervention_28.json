She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over the friend calling a co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for over three years. The friend, Sam, has been a co-worker for three years and has had a history of not interacting much with others but being friendly towards the girlfriend. The author was okay with that because the girlfriend was upfront about the situation. \n\nThen, the girlfriend deleted some messages. The author found out through her Fitbit that she deleted messages where the friend referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The author confronted her, and she admitted to moving on from the message. The author then decided to cut off the friend because they felt disrespected, thinking the friend was joking about the co-worker as a boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The friend's comment was a joke, which might be common in workplaces as \"work spouses\" or \"work husbands.\" The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so she might have already addressed it. The author's reaction is to end the friendship, which is a big step. \n\nBut the key points here are trust and communication. The author trusted the girlfriend initially and was okay with the situation. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend handled it by moving on. The author's main issue is that the friend used the term \"boyfriend,\" which they find disrespectful. However, cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke might be too harsh. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out about the deleted messages through the Fitbit is a bit underhanded, even though they didn't technically hack the phone. The girlfriend's reaction shows she's unaware of the real reason, which might add to the tension. \n\nIn relationships, jealousy is natural, but the response should be proportional. Ending a friendship over a joke might be crossing a line. The author could have discussed the discomfort with the girlfriend and asked her to address it with the friend instead of cutting off the friend entirely. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the action of ending the friendship might be too extreme. It's possible the author is in the wrong (Answer A) for overreacting, but others might see it as protecting the relationship (Answer B). However, considering the context, Answer A makes more sense because the reaction is disproportionate to the issue.\n"
