She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The author is okay with the friend waving at her coworker (Sam) but now there's an issue because the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as disrespectful. The girlfriend deleted messages, which the author found out through her Fitbit. He confronted her, and now he wants to end the friendship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether cutting off a friend over a joke about a coworker is justified. The friend called the coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as an insult. However, the girlfriend didn't engage with the message and moved on. The author is using the deleted message as a reason to end the friendship. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is important. The fact that the girlfriend deleted messages might indicate some secrecy, but the author used a Fitbit to find out, which involves some level of intrusion. Also, the author is cutting off the friend based on one joke. Is that a reasonable reaction? Maybe the friend didn't mean any harm, and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author's action could be seen as overreacting, especially since they've been in an on-and-off relationship for four years, which might contribute to jealousy or control issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend disrespects the relationship by making such a joke. However, the appropriateness of the reaction is key. Cutting off a long-time friend over a single comment could be seen as harsh. The friend might not have intended to offend, and the girlfriend didn't take the comment seriously. The author's approach could be damaging to the friend's relationship without a valid reason. \n\nThe fact that the author used the Fitbit to snoop into messages might also play a role. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, using a third-party device to access them could be an invasion of privacy. The author's method of finding out the messages might not be ethical, which could influence whether his actions are justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to have playful nicknames at work, but calling someone a \"boyfriend\" when they're not in a relationship could be inappropriate. However, the friend might not have realized the implications, especially if there's no actual relationship. The author's reaction might be based on misinterpretation or overreaction. \n\nThe girlfriend's response to ignore the message suggests she didn't take it seriously, which could mean the friend didn't mean it maliciously. The author's decision to end the friendship without addressing it with the friend first is abrupt. A more appropriate approach might be to talk to the friend about the issue and set boundaries instead of cutting her off.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions seem extreme. The situation involves elements of jealousy, privacy invasion, and overreaction to a potentially innocent joke. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because cutting off a friend based on a single comment without proper communication is not justified.\n"
