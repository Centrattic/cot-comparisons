She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending his girlfriend's friendship with her coworker because the coworker referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, let's call her \"Her Friend,\" for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially, trusting his girlfriend's assurance that there was nothing inappropriate. \n\nThen, the girlfriend deletes messages from her coworker. The author discovers this through her Fitbit, which retains messages longer. The key message in question is a joke where the coworker refers to another guy as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author confronts her, and based on the content of the message, decides the friendship should end because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) context, the author is asking if he's wrong for cutting off the friendship. The main factors here are trust, communication, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the coworker's joke is disrespectful, using the term \"boyfriend\" for another man, which he doesn't find acceptable. He believes the girlfriend should have addressed it with her friend. However, there's a history of deleted messages and the author's own method of checking the Fitbit, which might indicate some level of mistrust or invasion of privacy. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong specifically for ending the friendship based on the coworker's comment.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries vary. Some people might find the \"work boyfriend\" joke harmless, while others see it as inappropriate if it's done in front of their partner. The author is asserting his boundary here, which is valid. However, whether cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke is excessive is debatable.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her friend was being playful and that the author overreacted. The friend's comment was likely intended as a joke, not a serious declaration. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling if he's dictating her friendships without discussing it. However, if the author communicated his discomfort and the girlfriend didn't address it, maybe ending the friendship is a way to show seriousness about their relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages might imply an issue with trust or privacy. If the author is already in the habit of checking her phone, that could affect how the situation is perceived. But the user specifically says not to focus on the phone-checking part. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, relationships are tricky because both partners have different expectations. The author isn't wrong for having a boundary, but cutting off a friend based on one instance might be seen as too harsh. However, if the friend's actions repeatedly crossed boundaries, it could be different. Here, it's a one-time joke, so the author's reaction might be disproportionate. On the other hand, if the author feels disrespected, he's within his right to express that. \n\nThe key is whether the author's action (ending the friendship) is a reasonable response. If the friend's actions were indeed a joke and not malicious, cutting off contact could be seen as an overreaction. However, if the author communicated his feelings and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously, then the author might have a valid reason. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision might be seen as his right to set boundaries, but the method might be questionable. However, in the context of the question, if the author is asking if he's the asshole, the answer would depend on cultural norms and relationship standards. In many cases, AITA moderators might side with the author not being the asshole if he communicated his feelings and the friend's actions were indeed crossing a line. However, if the friend's comment was a harmless joke, the author could be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut since the friend called another man the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author doesn't find okay, and the girlfriend didn't address it, the author's action could be justified. However, ending a three-year friendship over a single joke might be too harsh unless there's a pattern. The answer could be B (No, not the asshole) if the author is standing up for his boundaries, or A (Yes, he is the asshole) if the reaction is too extreme. \n\nGiven that the friend's comment was a joke and the author is cutting off the friendship without giving the friend a chance to address it, maybe the author is overstepping. But if the author feels that the joke is a sign of disrespect towards their relationship and communicates that, it's a matter of differing opinions. In many AITA cases, people would say the author isn't the asshole if he's setting boundaries, even if others disagree with the severity.\n"
