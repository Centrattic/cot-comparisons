She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (let's call them AITA) is in a relationship with their girlfriend, and she's been friends with a coworker, Sam, for over three years. The girlfriend has a co-worker friend who jokingly called another guy \"boyfriend,\" which AITA found out through deleted messages and Fitbit messages. AITA then told their girlfriend they don't want her to be friends with this coworker anymore because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. AITA's main issue is that the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend,\" which AITA sees as a lack of respect for their relationship. But the girlfriend is friends with Sam's coworker, not Sam himself. Wait, the original question mentions that the friend is the one who called the co-worker \"boyfriend.\" But in the background, it says that Sam is the one who waves at the girlfriend and they've been friends for three years. So the friend in question isn't Sam, but another coworker of the girlfriend's? Or is Sam the one who called the co-worker \"boyfriend\"? Wait, let me check again.\n\nThe user says: \"her friend said something along the lines of 'your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night'\". Wait, so the friend is referring to Sam as the boyfriend, implying that Sam is the boyfriend. But according to the background, the girlfriend's friend is someone else, and Sam is the coworker who waves at her but doesn't talk to others. Wait, maybe the friend is the one who called Sam the boyfriend? Or is Sam the one who's the co-worker? Let me parse this again.\n\nOriginal background says that the girlfriend's friend is a girl who has worked there and has been friends with the girlfriend for 3 years. The friend in question is the one who sent the message calling Sam \"boyfriend.\" Wait, the friend says, \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late...\" So the friend is referring to Sam as the boyfriend. But the girlfriend's boyfriend is the AITA. So the friend is calling Sam the boyfriend, which AITA takes as a problem.\n\nBut why is the friend calling Sam the boyfriend? Because Sam is a co-worker who waves at the girlfriend but doesn't talk to others. So the friend is jokingly referring to Sam as the boyfriend? Or is there confusion between the girlfriend's actual boyfriend (AITA) and Sam?\n\nThe problem here is that the friend is using the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, which AITA finds offensive. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend, and AITA found out through deleted texts. Then AITA decided to end the friendship with the friend. The question is whether AITA is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. In a relationship, you might have expectations about how others refer to you. If a friend refers to someone else as the boyfriend when they're not, that could be seen as inappropriate or a joke, but it's not the girlfriend's fault if the friend makes that mistake. However, AITA is taking it upon themselves to cut off the friend because of one joke. Is that overreacting?\n\nAlso, there's the context that the girlfriend had deleted messages, which AITA discovered via Fitbit. Then AITA used that to pressure her to tell what was deleted. This seems like an invasion of privacy. Even though the girlfriend might have been hiding something, using her Fitbit to find out could be seen as manipulative or controlling.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n1. Friend made a joke by calling Sam \"boyfriend,\" which AITA found out about.\n2. AITA used deleted messages (found via Fitbit) to confront the girlfriend, leading her to reveal the joke.\n3. AITA then decided to end the friendship with the friend for not respecting the relationship.\n\nIs this overstepping? The friend's comment might be a minor issue, and AITA is making a big deal out of it. Also, the method of finding out (using Fitbit) could be seen as invasive. The girlfriend might not have intended to hide anything but just deleted messages, which people often do. AITA's reaction could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Also, cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh unless there's a pattern of behavior. One instance of a joke might not justify ending a friendship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and cutting off the friend over a minor issue, and also for using invasive methods to uncover the messages. Therefore, answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
