She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the author (the boyfriend) is upset because his girlfriend's friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend,\" leading him to cut off their friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the friend (let's call her Jane) have been friends for three years. The boyfriend was okay with Jane being the only person Sam (the co-worker) interacts with at work. The issue arises when the friend refers to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" which the boyfriend finds disrespectful. The girlfriend deleted messages, which the boyfriend discovered through her Fitbit, and this led to the confrontation.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the boyfriend is wrong to cut off the friendship. Let me consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is expressing a lack of trust, even though he claims he trusts her. The fact that he went through her phone and used the Fitbit data to uncover deleted messages shows he's been invading her privacy. Even if he's not hacking, using her devices to find out what she's hiding is a privacy issue.\n\nThe friend's comment about Sam being her \"boyfriend\" seems like a joke or a light-hearted remark. The boyfriend is taking it as a personal slight, which might be overreacting. The girlfriend might not have a problem with the term, especially if it's just banter at work. The boyfriend's reaction to end the friendship over this could be too harsh. Relationships require communication, and instead of addressing the issue with the friend, he's cutting her off without giving her a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial acceptance of the friendship for three years shows he wasn't bothered before this incident. The fact that he's now using a single message to end the friendship might indicate that his trust issues are being triggered, possibly due to his own insecurities rather than any real wrongdoing by his girlfriend or her friend.\n\nThe girlfriend's deletion of messages could be innocent, as she said most were just about clothes. The boyfriend's method of finding this out through her Fitbit is manipulative, which adds to the problem. The way he's handling the situation is controlling, and cutting off a long-time friend based on one joke is extreme. The friend might not have intended any disrespect, and the boyfriend isn't giving her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's actions are based on a lack of trust and privacy invasion. His reaction is disproportionate to the situation. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
