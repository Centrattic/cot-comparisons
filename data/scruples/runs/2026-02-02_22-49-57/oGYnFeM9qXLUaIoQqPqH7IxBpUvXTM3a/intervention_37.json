She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend (GF) and the author have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for four years and are now living together. The GF's friend, let's say \"Friend A,\" has been friends with her for three years. The coworker in question, Sam, works with them and only interacts with the GF. The author was okay with this initially, trusting the GF's assurance that Sam isn't a big deal. \n\nThe key incident is that Friend A referred to Sam as \"boyfriend\" in a message. The GF deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. The GF admitted to ignoring the message and moving on. The author then decided to cut off the friendship, arguing that Friend A doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. The author might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate and could signal disrespect towards their relationship. However, the situation involves a third party's joke. The GF is friends with Friend A and may not have control over how others refer to others. \n\nThe author's reaction is to sever the friendship, which is a significant step. The issue here is whether the author overstepped. The GF didn't engage with the comment, so the problem might be more about the author's insecurity or trust issues rather than Friend A's actual behavior. \n\nAlso, using the Fitbit to find deleted messages without the GF's knowledge raises privacy concerns. Even though the GF didn't know, the author used that information to confront her, which could be seen as manipulative. This method might contribute to the argument that the author acted inconsiderately.\n\nFriend A's comment was likely a joke, and it's not clear if it was meant to mock or disrespect the author's relationship. The GF isn't in a relationship with Sam, so the term \"boyfriend\" here is probably a work-related joke. The author's decision to end the friendship over a single joke might be disproportionate, especially considering the long-standing friendship.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important, but cutting off a friend over a minor, likely innocent comment could be seen as unnecessary. The author should have discussed his feelings with his GF first rather than making a unilateral decision. The GF might feel that her friend isn't being blamed for a serious issue, and the author's reaction could damage their trust in the relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction is extreme and based on a misunderstanding. However, there's nuance. If the author felt deeply disrespected and communicated it properly, that's different. But cutting off a friend over a joke without addressing the issue with the GF first and without considering the context is problematic.\n"
