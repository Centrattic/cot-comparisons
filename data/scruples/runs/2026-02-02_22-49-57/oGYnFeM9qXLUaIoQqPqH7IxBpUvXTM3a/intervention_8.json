She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend has been friends with a coworker, Sam, for three years. The author was okay with their interaction because he trusted his girlfriend, who said Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit that she had messages where her friend referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The author then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is justified in cutting off the friendship because of a single instance where the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The author might feel that this is disrespectful and a boundary issue. However, it's important to consider if this is a reasonable reaction. The friend might have just been joking around, especially since it's common in workplaces to refer to others as \"work husband\" or similar terms. The author is taking a very strict stance against any such nicknames, but maybe that's overreacting.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. The author had to snoop through the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the messages. Even though the girlfriend didn't tell him about the nickname, the author resorted to checking her Fitbit, which might be an invasion of privacy. However, in this case, the author found out through an unexpected means (the Fitbit not deleting messages properly), so maybe he didn't directly invade her privacy beyond what she had already done by deleting messages.\n\nThe girlfriend's action of deleting messages could indicate that she felt the nickname was something she didn't want the author to know about. But she might have deleted them to avoid an argument, not necessarily because she was hiding something. The nickname itself might not be a big deal, but the author is taking it as a serious breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't confront the friend directly but instead told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her. The girlfriend might not have addressed the issue with the friend, so maybe the author is cutting the friendship off without giving the friend a chance to explain or clarify. That could be seen as unfair, especially if the friend didn't mean any harm.\n\nAlso, the author's trust in the girlfriend was initially there because she said Sam didn't talk to others. But the nickname might just be a joke among coworkers and not indicative of any deeper issue. The author's reaction seems harsh for a single incident, especially if the friend had no ill intent.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on whether cutting off a three-year friendship over a single nickname is excessive. The friend might not have realized the nickname was offensive, and the author's approach might be cutting off the friend without understanding the context. The author might also be overstepping by not allowing the girlfriend to handle the situation herself, especially if the nickname wasn't a big deal to her.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions could be seen as overreacting. The nickname might not be a valid reason to end the friendship, and the method of finding out through the Fitbit might have involved some invasion of privacy. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction is disproportionate and based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the situation.\n"
