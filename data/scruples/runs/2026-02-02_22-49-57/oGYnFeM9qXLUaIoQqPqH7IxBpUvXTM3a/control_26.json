She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was initially okay with their friendship since the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to many others at work. Now, the issue arises when the friend calls another coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. She claims she ignored the message, but the author isn't satisfied and wants the friendship to end.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships. Does the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" cross a line? The author is concerned about respect and how the friend addresses their relationship. However, the friend might not have intended any harm; maybe it was a joke or light-hearted. The girlfriend herself didn't object to the term at the time, so maybe she didn't see it as an issue.\n\nThe author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, but is it justified? The friend's comment alone might not warrant cutting off the friendship, especially since it wasn't directed at the author. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the author feels disrespected, he should talk to his girlfriend and the friend, not just end the friendship abruptly. Also, the girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being taken away by her partner making decisions about her social circle.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is overreacting. The friend's use of \"boyfriend\" is likely not a serious issue, and cutting off the friendship without discussing it with both parties is a harsh reaction. The author's approach is controlling and doesn't allow for resolution through communication. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
