She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend has a close friend, let's call her Emma, who works with her. The friend made a joke about calling another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" which is Sam, a coworker the author is already wary of. The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and through a Fitbit message, he discovered the joke. Then he told her he doesn't want her to be friends with Emma anymore because she doesn't respect him as her boyfriend.\n\nHmm. First, the author cut off the friendship over a single joke. Is that a reasonable reaction? The friend has been there for three years. The joke might have been innocent, maybe just a work friend term. The author is assuming the worst, thinking it's not okay to call another man \"boyfriend,\" even if it's a casual term. But maybe it's just a term of endearment they use at work. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to read deleted messages without the girlfriend's knowledge. That seems like a breach of trust, even if he found out accidentally. He's not really hacking; he's using a tech quirk. But the fact that he's monitoring her Fitbit messages might be an invasion of privacy. \n\nHe's demanding she end the friendship without giving Emma a chance to explain. Maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it. The author is taking a harsh stance without understanding the context. Relationships require communication, but he's acting unilaterally. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected. Using \"boyfriend\" could be seen as crossing a line if it's about his partner's significant other. But the friend might not realize that. However, cutting off a three-year friend over one message seems extreme. \n\nThe girlfriend did delete messages, which is a red flag. But the author's method of finding out is questionable. He's using a Fitbit message that doesn't delete as fast, which he didn't know before. But he's still using that information to demand she cut off a friend without her input. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's reacting to a perceived slight without proper communication. He's not allowing the friend to apologize or explain. His actions (using Fitbit to read messages) might be crossing into privacy issues. Cutting off a friend over a joke without discussing it could be too harsh. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because the reaction is disproportionate and based on assumptions without addressing the friend directly.\n"
