She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another colleague as her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this girl for over three years, and the author initially was okay with their friendship since she mentioned that the colleague (Sam) doesn't really talk to others. The issue arises when the friend calls another co-worker her \"boyfriend,\" which the author objects to. The author found out about this by the girlfriend deleting messages, but he got the information through her Fitbit tracking. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend herself ignored it. The author then decides to end the friendship, claiming the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend made a joke that the author finds disrespectful. On the other, the friend didn't have any romantic intent, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is taking a firm stance on boundaries, but cutting off the friend entirely might be an overreaction. The girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping by controlling her friendships based on a joke. Also, the method of finding out through the Fitbit and prior phone checking could be seen as invasive, even if the author didn't hack the phone. The key points are the author's trust issues, the nature of the joke, and the appropriate response to a friend's comment. It seems like the author is being controlling and not giving the friend the benefit of the doubt, which could be seen as the asshole move here.\n"
