She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend have been on and off for four years and live together now. The girlfriend has a female coworker (let's call her Jane) who's been a friend for over three years. This coworker, Jane, refers to another coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through deleted messages on the girlfriend's Fitbit, which she didn't know about. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message when Jane called Sam her boyfriend. The author then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because of this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The author discovered the message through the girlfriend's Fitbit after she deleted the texts. This method of discovery is a bit sneaky since he didn't tell her he was using the Fitbit. Even though she thought he hacked her phone, maybe he used that to cover up his actual method. This could be a point against him because it's about privacy and trust.\n\n2. The friend called another coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The girlfriend says she ignored it, so maybe she didn't agree with the term either. But the author is taking a hard stance, cutting off the friend entirely because of one joke. \n\n3. The author is asking if he's the asshole for cutting off the friend. The question is about whether his reaction is justified. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics: In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author didn't talk to his girlfriend about his discomfort with the term \"boyfriend\" being used for Sam but instead cut off her friend without discussing it with her. That seems abrupt. Also, the method of finding out via the Fitbit might have undermined her trust if she found out later. \n\nHowever, the author is asserting his boundaries regarding how others refer to other men in the context of a relationship. If the girlfriend had been okay with the term, maybe it's different, but she ignored the message, which might indicate she wasn't comfortable. Still, cutting off a friend over one instance might be an overreaction, especially if the friend didn't intend it as a joke or was just using casual terms common in workplaces. \n\nAlso, the author's approach was to cut off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. Maybe the friend didn't realize the term could be offensive, and a warning to the girlfriend to address it might have been better. \n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's actions: She deleted messages, which can be seen as a red flag because it's about secrecy. But the author's method of discovering this through the Fitbit is also a privacy issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction is harsh. Cutting off a friend based on one message, especially using underhanded methods to find out, might be the asshole move. But if the author truly felt disrespected and communicated that, maybe it's a different story. However, without prior discussion, cutting off the friend seems extreme. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was too severe and he didn't communicate properly, instead using a sneaky method to find out and then cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to address it.\n"
