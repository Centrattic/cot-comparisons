She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because she called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend (GF) has been friends with this coworker, let's say \"Anna,\" for over three years. The GF's coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't interact much with others but does interact with GF. The author (the man) was okay with this because the GF said it was innocent.\n\nThen, there's an issue where the GF deleted messages. The author used her Fitbit to find out that she had deleted a message where Anna referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The GF explains she ignored it and moved on. The author then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Anna anymore because she disrespects him and them as a couple.\n\nThe question is whether cutting off the friend is the author's fault. \n\nHmm. Relationships are about trust and communication. The key points here are the friend's comment and the author's reaction. The friend called another man \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. GF tried to downplay it, saying she ignored it. The author is upset because the friend made a joke that he didn't find acceptable, leading him to cut off the friend.\n\nIs it reasonable for the author to be upset? Maybe. If the friend's comment is meant to imply a romantic relationship that doesn't exist, that could be seen as mocking or dismissive of the author's relationship. However, sometimes coworkers use terms like \"work husband\" or \"girlfriend\" jokingly without any intent. The author might be overreacting if the friend was just teasing and the GF handled it by ignoring it. \n\nBut the author's action\u2014cutting off the friend\u2014seems harsh. Ending a friendship based on a single joke, even if it's disrespectful, is a big step. The GF might feel that her friend is being punished for a minor transgression, especially if she didn't support the term and moved on. The author's trust in the GF's judgment might be shaken because she didn't confront her friend, but that doesn't necessarily mean the friend is wrong. \n\nAlso, the context of the GF deleting messages and the author using the Fitbit to find out adds another layer. The GF's secrecy might have led to the author's suspicion, but using technology to snoop can erode trust. The author's methods might be questionable, even if his intentions weren't. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the author is uncomfortable with how the friend refers to others, it should be discussed with the GF first. Confronting the friend or cutting her off without her input might not be fair. The GF might want to address the issue herself, or they could agree together. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's justified in his feelings of insecurity or disrespect, but cutting off the friend unilaterally without considering her perspective or the GF's existing relationship might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended harm, and the GF might value the friendship despite the joke. The author's reaction seems impulsive and possibly based on mistrust due to his snooping. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his response is disproportionate and he didn't address the issue with the GF and friend first.\n"
