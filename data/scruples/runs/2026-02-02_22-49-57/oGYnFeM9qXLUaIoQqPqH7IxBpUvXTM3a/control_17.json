She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author have a complicated history. They've been on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. The friend in question, let's say \"Friend A,\" has been friends with the girlfriend for over three years. She's been working with someone named Sam for a while, and there's been some tension because the author was okay with her having a friendly relationship with Sam, but now Friend A called Sam her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nThe author found out through a Fitbit message that Friend A referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author then decided to cut off the friendship because he felt disrespected. The girlfriend didn't delete the message, but the author used the Fitbit to see what she had erased, which included some innocuous messages. The key point is the comment about Sam being called the boyfriend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, trust is a big part here. The author trusted the girlfriend initially about her relationship with Sam. Then, after finding out about the Fitbit messages, he reacted strongly by cutting off the friend. The problem is whether the friend's comment was a joke or a serious statement. The girlfriend said she ignored it, so maybe she didn't take it seriously. The author is upset because he feels disrespected, but cutting off a long-term friend seems extreme unless there's a deeper issue.\n\nAlso, the author's method of discovering the messages (using the girlfriend's Fitbit) could be seen as invasive, even if he didn't hack her phone. The girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping by using a third-party device to monitor her. However, the focus here is on the decision to end the friendship based on a single comment. \n\nFriendships are important, and cutting someone off over a joke or a casual term might not be justified. The author is enforcing strict boundaries, which might be his right in a relationship, but it could be seen as controlling if the friend wasn't aware that the term was offensive. The girlfriend didn't confront her friend about the term, which might have been a better approach than ending the friendship abruptly. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is being controlling by cutting off the friend without addressing the issue with her. The friend's comment might have been a joke, and the author didn't give her a chance to clarify. The girlfriend's initial reaction was to ignore it, which suggests it wasn't a big deal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by overreacting and cutting off the friend without proper communication.\n"
