She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because that friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this girl for three years, and the author was okay with their friendship initially. The issue arises when the friend refers to a male coworker (Sam) as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages and the Fitbit, which led him to confront the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the author's decision to end the friendship based on a single joke. The friend's comment might be a joke, but the author is taking it seriously. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on, so maybe she didn't find it offensive. The author is cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to apologize or explain, which might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the author is using the fact that the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend\" as a reason to end the friendship. But the friend might not have intended it that way; work relationships can sometimes have casual nicknames. The author's trust in the situation was already established, so this incident might not be a valid reason to cut ties. \n\nAdditionally, the author is acting without considering the girlfriend's perspective. She might value the friendship and feel that the author is being too controlling. Communication between the couple is important here. The author's approach seems abrupt and possibly unnecessary, especially if the friend didn't mean harm. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. The friend made a joke, and the author is taking it as a personal slight without addressing it with the friend first. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
