She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend\". \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author initially didn't mind the friendship, even though the coworker is the only one she interacts with. The issue arises when the friend refers to another coworker as her \"boyfriend\", which the author finds disrespectful. The author found out through deleted messages (discovered via the Fitbit) and then decides to end the friendship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's comment was a joke or a casual reference, which many people might do in a workplace. The girlfriend didn't respond to it, but the author is upset because of it. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the friend made an offhand comment, and the author is taking it very seriously. The girlfriend might have thought it was a harmless joke. The author's approach is quite drastic\u2014ending the friendship without discussing it with the friend. Instead of addressing the issue directly with the friend or talking it out with the girlfriend to understand the context, the author is taking a confrontational stance. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out about the deleted messages through the Fitbit is a bit of a privacy invasion, even if the girlfriend was the one deleting them. The author used the girlfriend's own oversight to get information, which might not be the healthiest way to handle trust issues. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have talked to the girlfriend about their feelings regarding the term \"boyfriend\" without immediately cutting off the friend. Ending a long-term friendship over a single joke might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the author's reaction could strain the girlfriend's trust if she feels her friend is being unfairly targeted. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is acting out of jealousy and mistrust, reacting harshly without fully understanding the context. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction is disproportionate and based on a minor issue.\n"
