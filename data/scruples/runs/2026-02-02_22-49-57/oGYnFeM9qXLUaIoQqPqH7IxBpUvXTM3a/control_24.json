She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend has been friends with a coworker named Sam for over three years. Sam is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this before. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author found out about via her Fitbit. One of the deleted messages was her friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author confronted the girlfriend, and now he's cutting off the friend because he feels disrespected.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" the author is upset, and he's ending the friendship over it. The girlfriend didn't tell the friend to stop using that term. The author doesn't like either \"work husband\" or joking about it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Well, friendships can be personal. The friend's comment might be a harmless joke, but the author feels it's disrespectful. However, cutting off someone over a single message seems extreme. The girlfriend didn't act on the comment, but maybe the author is overreacting. Trust is a big part of relationships, but is it the author's place to dictate who she can be friends with? Also, the author used her Fitbit to check deleted messages, which might be a privacy issue. But the main question is about cutting off the friend because of the term used.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as a partner. But maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it. The author might be overstepping by ending the friendship without discussing it with the girlfriend first. The girlfriend might value that friendship and could feel the author is being controlling. On the other hand, if the author feels uncomfortable, he should communicate that. But cutting off the friend entirely without giving her a chance to explain or apologize might be too harsh. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as overreacting. The friend's comment might not be a big issue, and ending the friendship based on that could be unjust. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a valid concern about being disrespected in the relationship. However, the method of cutting off the friend without discussion seems harsh. So I think the answer is A.\n"
