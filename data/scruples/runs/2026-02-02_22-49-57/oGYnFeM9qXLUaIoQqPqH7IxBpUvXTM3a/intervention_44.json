She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person (let's call him the author) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author was okay with the friendship initially, trusting his girlfriend. The issue arose when he found out the coworker called another guy \"her boyfriend,\" which he took as a joke that disrespects him as the boyfriend. The author then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to continue being friends with this coworker.\n\nThe girlfriend deleted messages, but the author discovered this through her Fitbit. He confronted her, and she admitted to ignoring the message and moving on. The author believes she should have told the friend to stop using the term, and now he's cutting off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's jealousy is triggered by the term \"boyfriend\" being used by the coworker. But is the term inherently problematic? In some workplaces, people might use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as playful terms. However, the author doesn't accept that and sees it as a direct mockery of their relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend used the term in a message, which the girlfriend deleted. The author found out via the Fitbit. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended any disrespect, but the author interprets it that way. The question is whether the author is wrong to end the friendship over this.\n\nThe main factors to consider are: 1) Is the term \"boyfriend\" in a work context a valid reason for cutting off a friend? 2) Did the author overreact, or is it a justified boundary? 3) Does the author have the right to dictate who his partner can be friends with in this situation?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. The author's immediate reaction to end the friendship might be seen as controlling if the girlfriend's friend didn't mean any harm. The author's trust issues might stem from the phone deletion, but he already trusted the girlfriend before. The sudden cutoff might come across as disproportionate, especially if the term was a harmless joke. However, if the author feels disrespected, that's his right, but cutting off a long-term friend based on one instance could be seen as harsh. The friend might not have realized it was offensive. The girlfriend's response (ignoring the message) suggests she didn't take it seriously either.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's about balance. If the author is respecting his own boundaries but is being overly controlling, that's a problem. If he's standing up for himself but the reaction is extreme, then maybe he's in the wrong. However, the friend's use of the term without considering how it might affect the girlfriend's relationship could contribute to the problem. The author's trust was already shaken by the deleted messages, which adds stress to the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action might be seen as overreacting. Ending a friendship over a term that could be a joke, especially without giving the friend a chance to apologize or correct the behavior, might be too harsh. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend and perhaps addressed the friend directly before cutting ties. Cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or change her behavior could be viewed as the author overstepping.\n"
