She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend being friends with a coworker, and the author cutting off the friendship because the coworker called another guy her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through some deleted messages that the friend made this joke, and now he wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the coworker (Sam) have been friends for three years. The author was initially okay with the friendship because he trusted her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that she had deleted messages. One of those messages was the friend referring to Sam as the boyfriend. The author then told the girlfriend to cut off the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him as the man in the relationship.\n\nSo, does the author have a valid reason? The main issue here is the friend's comment about Sam. The author is upset that the friend called someone the girlfriend's boyfriend, which he sees as disrespectful. However, the girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, just ignored it. The author is taking this as a breach of boundaries and cutting off the friendship entirely. \n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries, it's common for people to have preferences about how others refer to their partners' relationships. If the friend's comment was a joke, maybe the author expects the friend to be more respectful. But cutting off a three-year friendship over a joke might be extreme. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as leverage, which could be manipulative. The girlfriend might feel that her privacy is being invaded, especially since she thought he was hacking her phone. \n\nAnother angle: the author is reacting based on a single message, which could be a misunderstanding. The friend might have been joking, and the author is overreacting by ending the friendship. The girlfriend might feel that her friend is being unfairly punished, especially since the friend didn't realize the author was upset. The author's approach might be causing unnecessary tension in the relationship and could be seen as controlling behavior, especially if he's pressuring the girlfriend to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that certain boundaries are important, and respecting those boundaries is crucial in a relationship. However, the way he's enforcing it\u2014by cutting off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend or giving the friend a chance to correct her behavior\u2014could be problematic. Healthy relationships require communication, and maybe the author should have talked to the friend first or discussed it with the girlfriend to understand her perspective better.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used the Fitbit data to confront the girlfriend about deleted messages suggests a lack of trust and potential invasion of privacy. This could be a separate issue contributing to the problem. The girlfriend might feel that her privacy is being violated, which could lead to further conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a right to be upset about the friend's comment, cutting off a long-term friendship over a single joke without addressing it directly with the friend and considering the girlfriend's feelings might be overreacting. The method of confronting the girlfriend by using her Fitbit data and then cutting off the friend could be seen as controlling and not fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
