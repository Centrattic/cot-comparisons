She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and her friend have been friends for over three years. The friend, Sam, has been working with them for three years. The author was okay with the friendship initially, trusting his girlfriend's assurance that Sam didn't interact much with others. Then, there's the issue of deleted messages. The author found out through the Fitbit that his girlfriend had deleted messages, leading to a confrontation. The main trigger was the friend's comment referring to another coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as disrespectful to their relationship.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the friendship because he feels disrespected. The key points here are: does the friend's comment justify cutting off a long-term friendship? The friend's comment was a joke, maybe, but the author takes it seriously. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message, moving on quickly. The author's trust might be shaken, but is his reaction excessive?\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author's approach seems harsh. Instead of discussing boundaries with the friend, he cut off the friend entirely. The friend might not have realized it was an issue. The girlfriend might feel caught in the middle. The author's decision is based on one instance, which could be a minor joke. Cutting off a friend over a joke about a work \"boyfriend\" might be overreacting. The author might be projecting his own insecurity or jealousy. He also used the Fitbit to track deleted messages, which could indicate underlying trust issues. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the action of cutting off the friend without addressing the issue directly might be the asshole move. The right approach would be to talk to the friend and set boundaries rather than ending the friendship abruptly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
