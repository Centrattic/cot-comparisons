She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who had a friend at work, and the boyfriend is upset that the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The author of the post then decides that the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with that coworker anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The boyfriend (the person posting) found out that the friend referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend didn't tell him about it, even though she later admitted to deleting messages. The author is saying that because of this, the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship, so he wants her to cut off the friendship. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the boyfriend's reaction is justified. On one hand, the friend's comment might be seen as a joke or a work-related term, common in some workplaces. But the boyfriend is taking it seriously, maybe because of jealousy or insecurity. He's also using the fact that the girlfriend deleted messages, which he found out through her Fitbit, to get her to confess. \n\nI need to consider if cutting off a friend over a joke is reasonable. The friend had been friends with her for three years, and the comment might not have been intended to offend. The boyfriend's approach seems pretty harsh\u2014ending the friendship based on one message. Also, the fact that he's using the girlfriend's phone checking (even if she deleted messages) could be an issue. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend didn't confront the friend about the comment, which might be a problem too. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with any kind of \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" situations, maybe he should have discussed that earlier. However, the friend's comment might not be as serious as he thinks. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the decision to end the friendship is based on a single instance that could be a joke, and without the girlfriend addressing it first, that seems extreme. But if the boyfriend feels disrespected and the friend didn't consider his feelings, then maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the way he found out through snooping might affect the situation. Using her Fitbit to read deleted messages could damage trust. But the user's question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong for not allowing the friendship anymore. The method of finding out might not be the main point here, as per the user's note. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be overreacting. Ending a long-term friendship over a single joke could be seen as excessive. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But if the boyfriend's boundaries were never communicated, then he has a point. However, the severity of cutting off the friend seems too harsh. I think the answer is A because the reaction is disproportionate to the action.\n"
