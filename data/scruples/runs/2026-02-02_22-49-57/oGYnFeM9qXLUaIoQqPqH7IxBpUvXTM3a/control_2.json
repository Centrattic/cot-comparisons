She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend (GF) has a friend (let's call her Jane) who she's been friends with for three years. The GF's co-worker, Sam, is someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but has a friendly rapport with her. The author was okay with this because the GF told him that Sam doesn't talk to others, just waves at her.\n\nThen, the GF and author both check each other's phones. The GF deleted messages, but the Fitbit saved them temporarily. The author used the Fitbit to find out that Jane called Sam \"her boyfriend,\" which upset him. The GF claims she ignored the message and moved on, and the author believes her. He then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as her partner.\n\nThe key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries in a relationship. The author is upset because he feels disrespected by Jane's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, even if it was a joke. But is it his place to decide their friendship? The GF has been friends with Jane for three years; cutting her off entirely over a single message might be overreacting. The author's main issue is the term used by Jane, which the GF didn't address. However, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit messages) is a bit sneaky, especially since they both check each other's phones. \n\nIs it the author's right to end the friendship? The GF didn't confront Jane, but the author is taking it upon himself to end the friendship. In relationships, it's important for partners to communicate their boundaries. If the GF didn't clarify to Jane that calling someone else \"boyfriend\" was an issue, maybe she should have. However, the author's response seems extreme\u2014ending the friendship entirely without discussing it with the GF. He's making a decision that affects his GF's personal relationships based on a single message. \n\nAlso, the fact that they both check each other's phones is a red flag for trust issues. The author used the GF's own actions (deleting messages) to get information, which might be manipulative. Even if the GF is lying about the content, the author's approach to resolving the issue by cutting off the friend might not be fair. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is acting out of jealousy and a lack of trust. While it's valid to be upset about being disrespected, the solution of cutting off the friend entirely without giving Jane a chance to explain or the GF a chance to handle the situation herself is probably overstepping. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
