She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend (GF) has a long-time friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" and the author (the boyfriend) is upset and wants the GF to stop being friends with that person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The GF and her friend have been friends for three years. The author is okay with her being friends with Sam, a coworker who only interacts with her. Then, the GF deletes messages, and the author finds out via her Fitbit that her friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset and wants the friend to stop being in touch because the friend \"doesn't respect him as the man in the relationship.\"\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is overreacting or justified. The friend's comment seems like a joke, but the author sees it as a serious disrespect. The GF didn't take the comment seriously and moved on. The author is taking a hard stance by cutting off the friendship entirely. \n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. It's common for people to have work friends with playful nicknames, but the author's reaction might be too harsh. The GF didn't engage with the comment, so maybe the friend was just joking. The author's decision to end the friendship based on one message might be too extreme. Also, using the GF's Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages raises privacy issues. Even if the author is concerned, the method of finding out might not be healthy.\n\nAnother angle: trust is a big part of relationships. The author initially trusted the GF when she said Sam wasn't a problem. Now, he's breaking that trust by cutting off her friend without discussing it with her properly. The GF might feel he's overstepping. Also, the author's approach is to end the friendship instead of discussing boundaries with the friend, which could be a more constructive solution.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as controlling and not respecting the GF's autonomy in her friendships. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the author's response is cutting off a long-term friendship over a joke. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
