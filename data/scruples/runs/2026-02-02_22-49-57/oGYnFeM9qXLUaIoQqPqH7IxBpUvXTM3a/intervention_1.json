She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages and the Fitbit that the friend made this comment.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, a male coworker. The author doesn't want their girlfriend to associate with her friend anymore because they feel disrespected. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on, but the author still sees the friend's comment as a breach of boundaries.\n\nNow, the friend using the term \"boyfriend\" in a professional setting\u2014maybe it's just a joke or a term of endearment at work. Some workplaces use \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" casually. The author is against that, thinking it's not okay. But is cutting off the friend entirely over this justified?\n\nThe girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The author didn't have a problem with the friendship before, only after finding out about the comment. There's also the aspect of the author sifting through deleted messages via the Fitbit, which might be an invasion of privacy. However, the user says not to focus on the phone-checking part.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The friend made a joke that the author found disrespectful. 2) The author is ending the friendship based on that. 3) The girlfriend's reaction and whether she should have addressed the friend herself.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. If the term \"boyfriend\" was a harmless joke, then the author's reaction could be too harsh. But if the author has clear boundaries and the friend crossed them, maybe it's reasonable. However, ending a long-term friendship over a single comment might be extreme. Also, the author is making the decision without letting the girlfriend handle it, which could be controlling.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed their feelings with the girlfriend first and maybe asked her to address the friend. Cutting off the friend without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize could be seen as harsh. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author's reaction could damage the girlfriend's friendship unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might undermine trust, but the user says not to focus on that. Still, the author's trust issues are part of the problem here. The author might be acting out of insecurity or jealousy, not the friend's actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid feelings of being disrespected, the way they're handling it\u2014immediately cutting off the friend\u2014might be too extreme. They should consider having a conversation with the girlfriend to address the issue together instead of unilaterally ending the friendship. So, the author is in the wrong for not allowing the girlfriend to maintain her friendship without proper discussion and understanding of the context.\n"
