She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The friend, Sam, has been a co-worker for three years, and the girlfriend has been clear that Sam doesn't talk to anyone much, just waves. The author was okay with that initially. \n\nThen, the girlfriend deleted some messages. The author found out through her Fitbit that she had messages deleted, and when confronted, she revealed a message where the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author now wants the girlfriend to cut off the friend because they feel disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider a few things. The friend called another guy \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, but the author is upset because the friend didn't respect the relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment might be a harmless joke, common in workplaces where people use terms like \"work husband.\" The author's reaction seems extreme\u2014cutting off a three-year friendship over a single message. Trust and communication are key here. The author used the Fitbit to find out what was deleted, which might be manipulative or invasive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner is uncomfortable with how the other interacts with others, it's valid to discuss boundaries. However, the approach here was to end the friendship abruptly without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Also, the girlfriend didn't act on the message, so the friend might not have been aware of the implications.\n\nThe author's methods (checking Fitbit data, not trusting the girlfriend's word) could be seen as controlling. The friend's comment might not have been meant to disrespect the relationship, so cutting off contact might be an overreaction. The author should have addressed the issue with the girlfriend and perhaps the friend directly instead of cutting them off immediately. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the drastic action and the use of surveillance tactics without open communication likely make the author the asshole here.\n"
