She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their girlfriend to continue being friends with a coworker friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the background: The girlfriend and the coworker (let's call her \"Friend A\") have been friends for over three years. The author is okay with her interacting with Friend A since they mentioned that Friend A doesn't talk to many others at work, just waves around. The author trusts his girlfriend because she was upfront about the relationship with Friend A and Sam.\n\nThen there's the part about checking phones. Both of them go through each other's phones, which is a red flag right there. The girlfriend deleted some messages, but the author found out because her Fitbit message history wasn't deleted immediately. The key message was Friend A referring to another guy, Sam, as \"boyfriend.\" The author confronted her, and she said she ignored it. The author then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with Friend A anymore because they don't respect him or the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off Friend A over a joke about a coworker being called \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate, especially since there's a real boyfriend in the picture. He might see it as a boundary violation. But Friend A could be using a term of endearment or a workplace joke, not a serious label. The girlfriend might think that the term is harmless, and the author is overreacting. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author's decision to end the friendship based on one message might be too harsh. Friend A didn't actually do anything wrong beyond maybe using a term that the author finds offensive. The girlfriend already addressed it by ignoring the message, so cutting off the friendship entirely might be an overreaction. Also, the context matters. If the friendship was already strained because of the author's jealousy, that adds another layer. But Friend A has been a friend for three years without issues, so one joke shouldn't destroy that. \n\nThe fact that both partners check each other's phones is a bigger issue. It suggests a lack of trust, which might be contributing to the author's overreaction. The author using the Fitbit data to accuse the girlfriend of hiding things is manipulative and not healthy. \n\nIn terms of the main issue: calling someone a \"boyfriend\" at work. It's possible that in their workplace culture, this is a common joke, not meant to imply an actual relationship. The author's reaction might be based on personal insecurities or lack of trust, rather than the actual harm done by the term. Ending a three-year friendship over this seems extreme. \n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because he's making a big deal out of a minor issue, cutting off the friend without considering the context, and his own behavior (phone checking) contributes to the problem. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
