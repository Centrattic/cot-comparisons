She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over the friend referring to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The boyfriend is okay with the friendship initially because the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else at work. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and the boyfriend discovers through her Fitbit that one of the deleted messages included the friend calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The boyfriend then tells his girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key issue here is the boyfriend's reaction to the friend's comment. The friend referred to someone else as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the boyfriend interprets as a lack of respect towards him. However, the friend might have been using the term \"boyfriend\" in a different context\u2014maybe as a nickname or a joke among coworkers. The girlfriend says she ignored the message and moved on, so she didn't take it seriously. The boyfriend, however, is cutting off the friend because of this one instance, which seems a bit extreme.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend is standing up for his relationship and feels disrespected. On the other hand, cutting off a three-year friendship over a single, possibly misunderstood comment might be an overreaction. The friend didn't address the boyfriend directly or disrespect him personally. The term \"boyfriend\" could be a casual work nickname, common in some workplaces. The boyfriend's trust issues might also play a role, especially since he's checked her phone and there's a history of on-and-off relationships.\n\nAlso, the way he found out through her Fitbit and then confronted her suggests he might be using this as an excuse to end the friendship, possibly to assert control. The girlfriend might feel betrayed if he's using technology to monitor her, even if she deleted messages. The friend's action, while perhaps inconsiderate, doesn't necessarily warrant ending the friendship. The boyfriend's response seems harsh and might be based on his own insecurities rather than the friend's intent.\n\nConsidering all that, the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate. The friend's comment isn't a valid reason to cut off someone who has been a long-time friend. The boyfriend is making a judgment based on a possible misunderstanding and his own trust issues. Therefore, he is in the wrong for overreacting and not giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
