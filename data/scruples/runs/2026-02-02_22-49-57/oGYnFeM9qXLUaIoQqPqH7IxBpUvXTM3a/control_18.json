She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a friend at work who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The author, the boyfriend, found out through some deleted messages and now wants the gf to stop being friends with that co-worker.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The gf has been friends with this girl for over three years. The co-worker, Sam, only interacts with her and others minimally. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the issue arises when the friend refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. The author discovered this through the gf deleting messages, which he found out via her Fitbit. He confronts her and then decides the friendship should end.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The main conflict is about boundaries in relationships. The author is concerned about his partner's friendship and how others perceive their relationship. However, the friend's comment might be an innocent joke, as the friend works with the gf and Sam is a co-worker. The author's reaction is to end the friendship based on one message. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as a direct slight. But in a work environment, sometimes people use such terms jokingly. The author's response seems extreme because the friend might not have intended it as a serious statement. Also, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit messages) might indicate he's already feeling insecure, which could be influencing his reaction. \n\nThe gf might have already addressed the comment by ignoring it. The author is now cutting off the friend without her input, which could be seen as overstepping. The friend might not know the author exists, so the term could be misunderstood. The author's trust in his gf is important; if he trusts her judgment in the friendship, perhaps he shouldn't dictate her social life based on a single joke. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected, which is valid. But cutting off a friend over a joke that the gf handled might be too harsh. The answer hinges on whether the friend's comment was truly inappropriate and if the author's reaction is proportionate. Since the friend's intent isn't clear, and the author's approach could harm the gf's social connections, he might be the asshole here. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction is disproportionate and he's making a decision without considering the context of the friend's comment and the gf's existing relationship with her friend.\n"
