She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who's the guy in the situation) is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her coworker anymore because that coworker called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend has been friends with a coworker (Sam) for three years. They've been on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. The guy is okay with the friendship because Sam doesn't talk to many others at work. But then, the guy finds out that the coworker referred to another guy as her boyfriend, and he decides the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with her anymore.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The guy is upset because he doesn't want his girlfriend to be friends with someone who jokes about another man as a boyfriend. But is that a valid reason? The girlfriend didn't find the comment problematic and didn't correct her friend. The guy is cutting off the friendship because of one joke, which might be overreacting. Also, the fact that they go through each other's phones complicates things. The guy used the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages, which might indicate a lack of trust or healthy communication.\n\nThe main question is whether cutting off a friendship over a single joke is reasonable. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the guy felt this was a boundary, he should have discussed it with his girlfriend before cutting off the friend. Plus, the girlfriend's friend might not have intended any harm. The guy's reaction seems harsh, especially since the girlfriend didn't engage with the joke and the friend's comment was likely innocent. The guy's actions might be seen as controlling, especially if he's monitoring her phone and using that to justify his decisions. So, the answer could be that the guy is in the wrong for not handling the situation through open communication and for cutting off the friendship based on a minor issue.\n"
