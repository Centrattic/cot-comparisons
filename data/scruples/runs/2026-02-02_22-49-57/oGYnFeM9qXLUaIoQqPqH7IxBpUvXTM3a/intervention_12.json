She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're an asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another guy her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a long-time friend at work, and the guy (Sam) had been interacting with her. The author found out through the Fitbit that the friend had called someone else \"boyfriend,\" and then decided the friend shouldn't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, the situation seems a bit complex. The author mentions that the girlfriend said the friend doesn't talk to many people at work, just waves at her. The author was okay with that initially. Then, when he found out about the \"boyfriend\" comment, he decided to end the friendship. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few things. The first is the nature of the \"boyfriend\" comment. The friend referred to someone else as \"boyfriend,\" which could be a work husband scenario. The girlfriend didn't respond to that message, but the author took it as an insult. The friend might have been joking, which is common in workplaces. The author's reaction seems strong\u2014cutting off the friend entirely because of a single message. \n\nAlso, the author admits to checking the girlfriend's phone and using data from her Fitbit. Even though he didn't hack, he used her Fitbit's delay as a way to find deleted messages. That might be a privacy issue. But he says the main issue is the friend's comment. \n\nIs the friend's comment really that bad? If it's a work context, people sometimes use terms like \"work husband\" or \"boyfriend\" as jokes. The author doesn't seem to accept that, which might be his own issue with boundaries. However, if the friend made a point to call someone else \"boyfriend,\" maybe the author feels disrespected. But ending the friendship over a joke might be overreacting. \n\nThe girlfriend's side: she's been friends with this person for three years. The author is now cutting her off because of one message. That could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain. The author might be overreacting, especially if there's no pattern of disrespect from the friend. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. The line between a joke and a slight can be blurry. If the friend knew the author and girlfriend were together and still used that term, maybe it's inappropriate. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nIn terms of the action taken\u2014cutting off the friend\u2014maybe the author could have talked to the friend first instead of ending the friendship. The way he handled it might be the problem. So perhaps the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's making a big deal out of a possible joke and not giving the friend a chance to clarify. Alternatively, if the author genuinely felt disrespected and communicated that to the friend, it might be different. But as it stands, ending the friendship without a discussion could be seen as overreacting. So the answer would be A.\n"
