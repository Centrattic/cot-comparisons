She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through some deleted messages that this happened, even though his girlfriend claims she moved on from the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, the girlfriend's response (or lack thereof), and the author's reaction. The friend's comment was likely a joke, as they mention \"work husband's\" are sometimes considered innocent. However, the author is not okay with that and has decided to cut off the friend.\n\nNow, relationships often involve boundaries. The author is expressing that he feels disrespected by the friend's joke. But is it reasonable to cut off a friend over a single instance? The friend and girlfriend have been friends for three years, which is a long time. The friend might not have realized the term could be offensive, especially if it's a common workplace joke. The girlfriend did defend the author by ignoring the message and moving on, which shows she might agree it's not appropriate and is trying to handle it.\n\nHowever, the author is taking it a step further by ending the friendship. This could be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend didn't intend any real disrespect. Also, the method of finding out (through Fitbit messages) and the girlfriend's deleted messages might add to the tension. The author's trust in his girlfriend is a factor here, but cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh. It's important to consider if they discussed the issue with the friend first before deciding to end the friendship. Direct communication might have resolved the issue instead of an immediate cutoff.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the action of cutting off the friend might be too extreme. The friend's comment was likely a mistake or a joke without malice, and the girlfriend already addressed it by not engaging further. The author's response could be seen as an overreach, making him the asshole in this scenario.\n"
