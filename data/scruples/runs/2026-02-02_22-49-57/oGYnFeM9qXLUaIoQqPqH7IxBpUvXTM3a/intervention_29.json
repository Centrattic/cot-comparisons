She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend (gf) having a friend at work who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend,\" leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author (let's call him John) found out through his girlfriend's Fitbit that she deleted messages where her friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" John then decided she shouldn't be friends with that person anymore. He believes the friend doesn't respect their relationship and is upset about the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone else. \n\nNow, considering the facts. The friend used \"boyfriend\" to describe Sam, but the girlfriend says she ignored it. John didn't trust her friend after this, even though the friend might have been joking. The question is whether cutting off the friendship is justified.\n\nJohn's reasoning: He feels the friend disrespected him by using the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, implying that the friend doesn't recognize their relationship. He also used the fact that she deleted messages, thinking she was hiding something. However, the friend might have been making a joke or using casual workplace terms, which are common in some work environments.\n\nPossible issues with John's approach: Using surveillance (via Fitbit) to find out about deleted messages might be an invasion of privacy. The friend's comment could be seen as a harmless joke, and cutting off a long-term friend over that is a significant action. Trust is a big factor here. The girlfriend had mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to many people, only waving at her. If John didn't trust her judgment in handling the friendship, that's a communication issue they might need to address together.\n\nAlso, the fact that John is acting unilaterally without discussing the friend's intentions with his girlfriend or the friend might be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction to the friend's comment (ignoring it) suggests she didn't take it seriously, so John's overreaction could be causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nIn terms of relationships, trust and communication are key. If the friend's comment was a joke, John might be overstepping by cutting off a friendship based on a single, possibly innocent message. However, if John feels that the term \"boyfriend\" is a boundary he doesn't want others to cross, then he's within his rights to express that. But the method of cutting off the friend entirely without addressing it with both his girlfriend and the friend might be too harsh.\n\nSo, is John in the wrong? Well, he's enforcing a boundary (not wanting others to use terms that imply a relationship with someone else), which is understandable. However, using surveillance and then cutting off a friend based on a single message might be excessive. The friend's comment might not have been intended to disrespect their relationship. The wrong here could be that John didn't address the issue directly with the friend or his girlfriend, leading to a rash decision. Also, the use of the Fitbit to snoop might have contributed to mistrust.\n\nIn conclusion, while John's feelings are valid, his actions might be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend's comment was a joke. The answer could lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the unilateral decision and possible overreaction. But if boundaries are important and he communicated them properly, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
