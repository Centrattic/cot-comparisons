She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend who's a coworker, and this friend called another coworker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset and wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with that coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has been on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. The girlfriend's coworker, Sam, has been a friend for three years. The author was okay with the friendship initially because the girlfriend mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to others much. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit that the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then cut off the friendship because he felt disrespected.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's main issue is the friend calling someone else the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" This could be a joke, but the author doesn't accept any such \"work husband\" jokes. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, so the author took it upon himself to end the friendship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's think. The girlfriend was friends with this person for years. The author is now cutting off the friendship based on one comment, which might be a joke. The author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as leverage, which might be manipulative. Also, the girlfriend didn't know she was being monitored via Fitbit, so the author's approach might be controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected by the friend's comment and is trying to protect the relationship. However, the way he's handling it seems extreme. Ending a long-term friendship over a joke without the girlfriend's input might be overreacting. The girlfriend didn't even address the comment, so the author taking that action without her agreement could be problematic. \n\nThe author's trust in the girlfriend was there initially, but now he's breaking that trust by using the Fitbit to monitor her phone messages. That's a privacy issue. Also, the author is making a unilateral decision about the friendship, which is a big move. The girlfriend might not appreciate being told who she can and can't be friends with, especially based on something that might have been a harmless joke. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem controlling and possibly overreacting. He's not giving the friend the benefit of the doubt, assuming the worst, and punishing the girlfriend by cutting off the friendship. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being violated. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
