She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because that friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend have been together for three months but had a four-year on-again-off-again relationship. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, Sam, for three years. The author initially thought it was okay because the girlfriend said Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author discovered through her Fitbit that one of the deleted messages was a friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because he felt disrespected.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for cutting off the friend. Let's break it down.\n\nThe friend called a co-worker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The girlfriend didn't say anything about it, which the author is upset about. The author's reaction is to end the friendship. \n\nNow, considering social norms, it's common for people to have \"work husbands\" or \"work boyfriends\" as jokes or platonic terms. The friend might not have intended anything romantic. The girlfriend might have been okay with it, given her three-year history with the friend. \n\nThe author's trust in the relationship is important. If the girlfriend was honest about her friendship with Sam and didn't hide anything, then the author's reaction might be overstepping. However, the fact that the friend used a term that implies a romantic relationship, even if it's not real, could be a point of contention. The author might feel that the friend is not respecting the relationship by using such terms.\n\nBut cutting off a friend just for a joke term seems harsh. The author could have addressed the issue by talking to the friend or the girlfriend about their feelings instead of ending the friendship abruptly. The girlfriend might feel that her social life is being policed, especially since they've been together for only three months. The on-again-off-again history might add to the sensitivity here.\n\nAlso, the author found out through a Fitbit, which could imply some level of invasion of privacy. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, using the Fitbit to discover them might be seen as underhanded. The author's method of finding out might affect the judgment of the situation.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach here was to cut off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend first, which might be seen as impulsive. The girlfriend's reaction and whether she supports the author's decision matter. If the friend was just joking and there's no actual romantic relationship, the author's reaction could be unwarranted.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the friend's comment, the girlfriend's response, the method of discovery, and the immediate action taken. It seems that the author might be overreacting by cutting off the friend without a conversation. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
