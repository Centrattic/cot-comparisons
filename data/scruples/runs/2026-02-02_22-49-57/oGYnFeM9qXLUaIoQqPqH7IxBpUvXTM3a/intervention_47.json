She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The guy (Sam) at the workplace only interacts with her, and the author was okay with that. Now, the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, he found out about the message. \n\nThe author then tells the girlfriend to cut off the friend because the friend doesn't respect their relationship. The key points here are about boundaries and trust. The author is upset that the friend made a joke that could be seen as undermining the relationship. But is cutting off the friend entirely the right move?\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment might be a harmless joke, common in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe it's an overreaction. The author's approach of ending the friendship based on one message could be seen as controlling, especially if the friend's intention was innocent. Also, the author used the girlfriend's deleted messages (via Fitbit) to confront her, which might indicate a lack of trust, even if he found out through her own mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate and disrespects their relationship. If the author values that boundary, it's reasonable to expect the friend to be mindful. However, cutting off the friend entirely might be too extreme unless there's a pattern of such behavior. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her social life is being restricted, especially since the friendship existed before the relationship. The author's decision could damage trust if the friend's comment was indeed a joke. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overreacted. The friend's one comment doesn't necessarily justify ending the friendship. The author's approach could be seen as controlling, especially if the girlfriend didn't object to the comment and the friend isn't aware of the relationship dynamics. The author might be in the wrong because he's making a unilateral decision without considering the friend's intent and the girlfriend's perspective on the friendship.\n"
