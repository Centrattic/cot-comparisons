She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over the friend referring to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for 3 months but had a 4-year on-again-off-again relationship. The girlfriend has a 3-year friendship with a coworker (Sam) who only interacts minimally at work. The author found out, through some phone-checking and Fitbit messages, that the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" leading him to demand that the girlfriend end the friendship. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The girlfriend's friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, which the author took as a personal disrespect.\n2. The author is upset that the friend didn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship.\n3. The author is using Fitbit data to uncover deleted messages, which might be a red flag for trust issues.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The friend's use of \"boyfriend\" could be a joke or a slip of the tongue. The author is asking the girlfriend to end the friendship because of this, which seems extreme. The girlfriend might not have intended harm, and ending the friendship could be unnecessary. The author's actions of checking her phone and using the Fitbit to find messages also indicate a lack of trust, which can be a problem in relationships. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that boundaries are important, and they feel that the friend is being disrespectful. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that her friend is just joked around and that it's not a big deal. The author is in a position where they might be overreacting, but they could argue that they have the right to set boundaries in their relationship. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the action taken was proportionate to the issue. The friend's comment is a minor issue, and cutting off the friendship over it might be seen as too harsh. Additionally, the author's method of finding out the messages (using the Fitbit to see deleted texts) could be a point against them, as it suggests intrusion into the girlfriend's privacy. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, the author's use of the Fitbit to uncover them might be considered unethical. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend might not have intended to be disrespectful. The term \"boyfriend\" is often used casually in workplaces, even if the author dislikes it. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling, especially if the friend was only joking. The fact that the author is using a somewhat sneaky method to check the girlfriend's messages adds to the perception that they're in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their partner should respect their relationship and not make them look bad. But the friend only used that term once, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is taking a stand on a boundary that they feel is important, but the way they handled it (without discussing it calmly) and the use of surveillance could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are questionable. They might be overreacting and not giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. Plus, the privacy invasion is a significant issue. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
