She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some trust issues and past phone-checking behavior.\n\nFirst, the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, a male coworker. The girlfriend claims that Sam doesn't talk to anyone much at work and that she ignored the message. The author found out through deleted messages on her Fitbit, which he used to confront her. He then decided to end the friendship because he felt disrespected.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main points are: the friend's comment was a joke, the girlfriend didn't engage with it, and the author is terminating the friendship based on that. Also, there's a history of checking phones and mistrust.\n\nIs it reasonable to end a friendship over a single joke? That might be harsh. The friend might not have intended it as anything serious. The author's reaction seems extreme, especially since the girlfriend didn't respond to the comment. The bigger issue here is the lack of trust\u2014using a Fitbit to catch deleted messages and invading privacy could erode trust. The author might be projecting his own insecurity rather than addressing the actual issue with the friend's comment. Ending a friendship over a joke could be seen as overreacting, so maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But if the author is really uncomfortable with the term, then maybe not. However, the method of confronting and the lack of communication with the friend directly might play a role. The answer might be A.\n"
