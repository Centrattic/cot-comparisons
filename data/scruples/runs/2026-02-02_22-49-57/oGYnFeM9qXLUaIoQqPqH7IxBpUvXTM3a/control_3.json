She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend (GF) who's been friends with a coworker for three years. The key issue is that the coworker called another guy her \"boyfriend,\" which the GF's partner (the author) found out through some deleted messages that were revealed via the GF's Fitbit. The author then told the GF to cut off the friend because they don't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is concerned about the term \"boyfriend\" being used by a coworker. Is that a valid reason to break off the friendship? Well, the coworker in question, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to others much at work but interacts a bit with the GF. The GF's friend made a joke about Sam being the \"boyfriend,\" but the GF says she ignored it. The author seems to think that the friend is being disrespectful by using that term, even if it's a joke.\n\nNow, the main question is whether cutting off the friend over this is reasonable. The GF and her friend have been friends for three years, which is a significant amount of time. The joke about \"boyfriend\" might be harmless, common workplace banter. The author's reaction seems extreme because he's taking it as a personal slight. He's also using the GF's deleted messages (which were revealed through her Fitbit) as a reason to confront her. But the GF might feel that this is an overreaction and that the friend's comment wasn't meant to be offensive.\n\nAnother point is the trust between the author and the GF. The author mentions they've been on and off for four years and live together now. Trust is crucial in a relationship, but cutting off a long-time friend over a joke might not be the right approach. The author could have discussed his feelings with the GF and the friend directly instead of demanding the friendship's end. \n\nAlso, the fact that the GF deleted messages, even if they were innocent, might indicate she felt the need to address the situation with her friend. The author's discovery through the Fitbit adds another layer of complexity, as the GF might feel violated or mistrusted. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, the author should have talked to the GF about his discomfort and maybe addressed it with the friend in a more constructive way. The friend's comment might not have been intended to disrespect the author, and the author's reaction could be seen as controlling or not trusting the GF's judgment about her friend's intentions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction seems disproportionate. Ending the friendship over a single joke might not be justified. The friend's action might be a minor issue, and the author's approach could harm the GF's friendships without a valid reason. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
