She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out through a Fitbit message that the friend referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had deleted messages, but the Fitbit showed the content. He confronted her and decided to end the friendship because he felt disrespected.\n\nNow, considering jealousy and trust issues. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with any male coworker interactions, even if they're platonic. The friend's comment was a joke, maybe a common workplace term, like \"work husband.\" The girlfriend didn't take the comment seriously and moved on, but the boyfriend took it as a personal slight.\n\nIs it reasonable to cut off a friend over a joke? The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014ending the friendship based on one message. Jealousy is normal, but taking such a drastic action without discussing boundaries with the friend first might be the problem. The girlfriend tried to ignore it, but the boyfriend decided the friend didn't respect him. That seems like an overreaction. The key issue is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong for cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. The friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which isn't necessarily a problem if it's a work term, but the boyfriend is not okay with it. So, the boyfriend's decision to end the friendship might be too harsh. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
