She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy (the author) who doesn't want his girlfriend to continue being friends with a coworker because that coworker called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author found out through some deleted messages, which he discovered via her Fitbit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author and his girlfriend have been on and off for four years and are now living together. That might mean there's some history of trust issues. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people at work but interacts a bit with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that before, but now he's upset because the friend called another man her boyfriend. \n\nThe key issue here seems to be about boundaries in friendships and how the author is reacting. The friend made a joke by calling Sam the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on, according to her. The author, however, is now cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable for the author to cut off the friendship. If the friend made a joke once, is that a valid reason to end a three-year friendship? Maybe the author is overreacting. Also, the girlfriend didn't engage with the message, so maybe she addressed it by ignoring it. The author is taking it upon himself to end the friendship, which might not be the friend's intention. \n\nAnother angle is the method the author used to find out\u2014checking her Fitbit and pressuring her about deleted messages. That could be seen as invasive and possibly manipulative. Even if he found out the truth, using such methods might not be healthy. The author might have trust issues, but using her Fitbit to monitor messages is a privacy invasion. \n\nThe author is also making a judgment about the friend's intentions. The friend might have just been joking around, and it's not a big deal. The author is not in a position to dictate who his girlfriend can or cannot be friends with unless there's a pattern of disrespect. One instance might not be enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected if he doesn't like the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone else. But cutting off the friend entirely might be too harsh. The appropriate response would be to talk to the friend and address the issue instead of ending the friendship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might not have communicated her boundaries properly to her friend. The author is now taking over and ending the friendship, which could strain their relationship if the girlfriend is upset about losing a friend. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be overreacting. Cutting off a friend over a single joke seems extreme. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first and maybe with the friend if necessary. Using her Fitbit to monitor messages is also questionable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
