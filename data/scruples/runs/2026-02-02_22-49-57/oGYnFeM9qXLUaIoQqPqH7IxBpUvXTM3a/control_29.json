She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend at work, a girl named Sam, who the friend called \"boyfriend\" when talking about another co-worker. The author found out through some deleted messages on the Fitbit and now wants the girlfriend to cut off that friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The author initially didn't have a problem with the friendship because he was told that Sam doesn't talk to many people and only interacts with her. Now, the trigger is the friend referring to another man as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as disrespectful to him and their relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as a partner and their relationship, so he's cutting off the friendship. He also mentions that he believes the girlfriend should have addressed this with her friend herself. But he's taking matters into his own hands by forbidding the friendship.\n\nLet me break this down. The main issue is whether the friend's comment was a joke or a serious term. The friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" In some workplaces, people might use \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as a joke or to indicate a close friendship. The author is not okay with that, but is that a valid reason to end a friendship?\n\nThe girlfriend has a history of deleting messages, and the author discovered this through her Fitbit. The friend's message was calling someone else her boyfriend. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author, upon finding out, is now demanding the end of the friendship. \n\nHere's the thing: while the author might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate, it's possible that the friend was just using a term common in their workplace. The author is assuming intent where maybe there was none. Cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke or term seems extreme. \n\nAlso, the author is acting without discussing the issue with the girlfriend and the friend. He's making a unilateral decision based on his interpretation of the situation. That could be overstepping. Relationships require communication, and it's possible that the girlfriend's friend didn't mean any harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the term was disrespectful, but in relationships, partners have the right to set boundaries. However, the way he's handling it\u2014cutting off a friend without considering the context or giving the friend a chance to explain\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like deleting messages and not being transparent, might contribute to the tension. But the author's response seems to be a reaction to a perceived slight from the friend, which might not be justified. He's assuming the worst about the friend's intent and taking drastic measures. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be overreacting. The friend's comment could be a workplace joke, and the author is taking it too seriously. Ending a friendship because of that without discussion could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to clarify. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
