She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend has a long-time female coworker friend. The guy is upset because the friend called a male coworker her \"boyfriend,\" and he's now cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years. The coworker Sam is described as not talking to many people but waves at the girlfriend. The guy was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages with her friend, and the guy found out through her Fitbit. One of the messages mentioned \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work.\" The guy interprets this as the friend jokingly referring to Sam as her boyfriend, which he finds disrespectful. He tells the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The guy's main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. He believes this is crossing a line and not respecting their relationship. However, the girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. She might not have found the term problematic. The guy's reaction seems to be based on trust issues, maybe from previous phone-checking and message deletion. But is cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke too harsh?\n\nPossible angles: The guy might be overreacting. The friend's comment could be a harmless joke, and the guy is using this as a reason to control the girlfriend's friendships. On the other hand, if the girlfriend didn't address the comment herself, maybe the guy is justified in setting boundaries. But cutting off a friend entirely over one message seems extreme. Also, the guy's methods of checking messages through Fitbit and pressuring her about deleted texts might contribute to the problem.\n\nAnother point: The guy is making the decision for the girlfriend about who she can be friends with. That could be a control issue. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being violated, especially if the friend's comment wasn't malicious. The guy's trust in the relationship is shaken, but reacting by ending a friendship over a single joke might be disproportionate.\n\nIn some contexts, \"work husband\" or similar terms are common and not meant seriously. If the friend was just joking, the guy's reaction is unwarranted. However, if the term was intended to imply a romantic relationship, that's different. The girlfriend's response (ignoring it) suggests she didn't take it seriously, so the guy's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy's action of cutting off the friend over one message seems excessive. The friend had a long-standing relationship. The guy might be using this as a way to exert control, given the prior issues with phone checking. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A). But if the guy's feelings are valid due to past trust issues, maybe not. But the extreme reaction of ending the friendship seems to tip it towards A.\n"
