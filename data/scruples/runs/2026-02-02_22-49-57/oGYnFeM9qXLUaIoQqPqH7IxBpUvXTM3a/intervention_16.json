She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The key points here are about trust, boundaries in relationships, and how to handle jealousy or insecurity.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, Sam, for three years. The author initially was okay with the relationship because the girlfriend told him that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else and just waves at her. But then, through a Fitbit message that wasn't fully deleted, the author finds out that the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The girlfriend says she ignored the message, but the author decides to end the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is standing up for himself and setting boundaries. He might feel that the friend's comment is inappropriate, especially since his girlfriend has been friends with her for a long time. He might not be comfortable with the idea of someone else being called her boyfriend, even if it's just a coworker. It's important in relationships to communicate your boundaries, and the author is doing that here.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a friend based on a single message might be a bit extreme. The friend could have been joking, or maybe it was a mistake. The girlfriend did say she ignored the message, which suggests she didn't support the comment. The author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Relationships require communication, and maybe the author should have talked to the friend first before cutting ties. Also, the author's method of finding out (through the Fitbit) might come across as invasive, even if the girlfriend was the one who deleted messages. Using her own device against her could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's trust. The author mentions that they've been on and off for four years and live together now. The girlfriend going through each other's phones is a red flag. If the author is using the Fitbit to monitor her, it might indicate his own lack of trust, which could be contributing to his reaction. However, the main issue here is the friend's comment and the author's response to it.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, it's reasonable for the author to be upset about the friend's comment. Calling someone else \"boyfriend\" in a professional setting is unprofessional and could be hurtful. However, cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it might be too harsh. The author could have talked to his girlfriend first to see how she felt and then approached the friend about the comment. Ending the friendship abruptly might be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't support the comment either.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a mix of both sides. The author has a right to set boundaries, but his method of enforcing them might be too harsh. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended any harm, and the author didn't give her a chance to address the comment. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with communication and understanding. Answer A.\n"
