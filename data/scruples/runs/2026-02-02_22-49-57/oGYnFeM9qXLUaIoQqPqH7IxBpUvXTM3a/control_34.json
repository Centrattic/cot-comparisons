She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The key points here are about boundaries in relationships, trust, and how to handle jealousy or insecurity.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years, and the author was okay with them being friends initially. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't really talk to others at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author found out that the friend called Sam \"her boyfriend,\" which made him cut off the friendship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is right to do that. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend said she ignored the message. The author's reaction is based on not wanting to accept any kind of \"work husband\" or similar terms, which he sees as disrespectful. But is cutting off a friend entirely over a single joke reasonable?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings about the term with the girlfriend first rather than immediately cutting off the friend. Ending a friendship because of a joke might be an overreaction, especially if the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship, just made a lighthearted comment. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out about the messages (using the Fitbit to see deleted texts) is a bit sneaky. While it's not hacking, it's still manipulating the situation to get information without the girlfriend's knowledge, which could erode trust. However, the main issue here is the response to the friend's comment.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should talk about boundaries and address issues directly. Cutting off a friend without resolving the issue with the girlfriend first might damage the relationship between them. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's established friendships. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't address the issue with his girlfriend first and overreacted by cutting off the friend. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for the relationship's boundaries. But the key is the approach taken\u2014communication over drastic actions.\n"
