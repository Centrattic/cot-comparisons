She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend live together and have been in an on-again-off-again relationship for four years. The friend in question, let's call her Jane, has been friends with the girlfriend for three years. The author was okay with the friend's interactions with the coworker Sam, as the girlfriend had mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to many people and just waves at her. \n\nThen, the author found out through a Fitbit message that the friend referred to Sam as \"her boyfriend\" in a text. The girlfriend deleted the messages, but the Fitbit message remained. The author confronted her and now wants the girlfriend to cut off Jane because he feels disrespected and that the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's reaction to a friend calling a male coworker \"boyfriend,\" the girlfriend's history of deleting messages, and the author using the Fitbit to find out. \n\nNow, the author's main argument is that they don't want the girlfriend to continue the friendship because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" inappropriately. He also believes the girlfriend should have told the friend not to do that. \n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. On one hand, the term \"boyfriend\" can sometimes be used humorously or as a nickname in workplaces, especially if there's a close relationship. However, the author might feel that this term is a boundary crossed. However, the friend's use of the term in a message that was later deleted might have been a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. \n\nThe author is taking a strict stance against any use of such terms, which could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended any harm, and the author cutting off the friendship based on one message seems extreme. Also, the girlfriend had deleted messages, which might indicate some secrecy, but the author's method of discovering this via Fitbit could be manipulative. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. The author's approach here might be causing unnecessary conflict. The friend's comment was a one-time thing, and cutting off a long-term friend over a joke could be seen as overreacting. The author might be projecting his insecurity rather than addressing the real issues in the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the author's reaction is likely the wrong approach because it's a disproportionate response to a minor incident and might stem from controlling behavior rather than a genuine concern for the relationship's integrity.\n"
