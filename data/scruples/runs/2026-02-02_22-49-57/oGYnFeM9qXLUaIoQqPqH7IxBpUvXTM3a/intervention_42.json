She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some trust issues and jealousy.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author seems okay with the friendship initially, trusting his girlfriend's assurance that the coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people. The main issue arises when the friend refers to another man as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as a lack of respect for their relationship.\n\nThe author discovered this through the girlfriend deleting messages, which led him to confront her. The friend's message was about someone else named Sam, not the author. The author then decides to cut off the friendship because of this one instance. \n\nNow, considering the factors: the author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected by the friend's joke. However, the friend's comment was about another coworker, not the author. The author's actions\u2014cutting off the friend\u2014seem extreme for a single joke, especially since the girlfriend already addressed it by ignoring the message. The author's trust in the relationship was already shaken by the message deletions, which might have contributed to his overreaction.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of ending the friendship without discussing it with his girlfriend first and based on a minor incident could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to clarify. Healthy relationships involve communication and understanding, not immediate punishment. The fact that the author used surveillance (Fitbit) to catch messages might indicate underlying trust issues, which could be a bigger problem than the friend's comment.\n\nSo, while the author has reasons to feel disrespected, cutting off a friend over a single, possibly innocent joke might be excessive. The real issue might be the author's lack of trust and the way he handled the situation, which could be more harmful than the friend's comment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for overreacting and not approaching the situation with more empathy and communication.\n"
