She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is upset because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to another coworker while talking to his girlfriend. He found out through messages that were deleted but later revealed via the Fitbit. \n\nThe girlfriend had been friends with this person for three years, and the author initially wasn't too concerned about their friendship. The friend (Sam) is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with his girlfriend. The issue arises when the friend calls another coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful.\n\nNow, the author is saying that the friend doesn't respect him as a partner and the relationship, hence cutting off the friendship. The key points here are whether calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a work context is a dealbreaker, and if the author overreacted by ending the friendship based on a single instance.\n\nI should consider cultural context. Sometimes in workplaces, people use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as jokes or to describe close platonic relationships. However, the author is firm that he doesn't find these terms acceptable. The girlfriend might not have seen the term as a big issue, as she didn't confront the friend.\n\nThe author's method of finding out\u2014using the Fitbit to see deleted messages\u2014raises questions about privacy. However, the user mentioned not to focus on this part. Still, the fact that he used a third-party device to access deleted messages could be seen as invasive, but the user says not to base the decision on that.\n\nThe main question is whether cutting off a friend over a single joke (even if it's a term the author dislikes) is too harsh. Friends often use playful terms without ill intent. The author is ending the friendship, which is a significant step, based on one message. There's no indication that the friend intended to disrespect the author or the relationship. The girlfriend also didn't take issue with the term, moving the conversation on.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, trust is important, but cutting off a friend over a minor, possibly misunderstood joke might be excessive. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping by not giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the girlfriend to maintain the friendship without sufficient reason.\n"
