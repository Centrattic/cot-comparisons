She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The key points here are about trust, communication, and how the author handled the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out that his girlfriend deleted messages with her friend, which led him to discover the friend referred to a coworker as her boyfriend. He then decided she shouldn't be friends with this person anymore because he felt disrespected. The question is whether cutting off the friend is justified.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate and a boundary issue. However, the friend might not have intended it as anything serious, just a work joke. The author's approach was to cut off the friend entirely, which is a significant reaction. Is that overreacting? Maybe, because the friend might not have realized the term was offensive, and the girlfriend might have been unaware of the context.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to going through the girlfriend's phone and using her Fitbit data. Even if he didn't hack her phone, using her Fitbit to find deleted messages might be seen as invasive. This could affect how the situation is perceived. If he trusted her initially, why the sudden distrust after this incident?\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author could have talked to his girlfriend about his feelings regarding the term \"boyfriend\" and asked her to address it with her friend, rather than cutting off the friend himself. By making the decision unilaterally, he might have overstepped, especially if the girlfriend didn't agree with his assessment of the friend's comment.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014deleting messages\u2014suggest she might have been trying to avoid a confrontation. Maybe she didn't think the friend's comment was a big deal. The author's reaction to her deleting messages (using the Fitbit to find out) shows a lack of trust, which can damage the relationship more than the original issue.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the author had discussed his discomfort with the term \"boyfriend\" with his girlfriend first, they could have found a solution together. Cutting off a friend based on one comment, especially without discussing it with his girlfriend, might be seen as impulsive and controlling. The friend's comment could be innocent, and the author's reaction might be disproportionate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might be viewed as overreacting and not giving the situation the proper context. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate properly and took a drastic step without considering his girlfriend's perspective or the friend's intent.\n"
