She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the key points: The couple has been together for 4 years on and off, living together for 3 months. The girlfriend has a long-time friend at work who has a history of not socializing much but has interacted with her. The author found out through her Fitbit that her friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to cut off the friendship, claiming the friend doesn't respect him.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. The author is upset about being called a boyfriend by someone else, which is a term of endearment typically reserved for a partner. Even if it's a joke or \"work husband,\" it can be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, which might be a point of contention. The author feels disrespected and wants to end the friendship as a result.\n\nHowever, the method of finding out through sneaking (using Fitbit messages) might be a red flag. If the author is checking her phone and using her Fitbit to find messages she deleted, that's a privacy issue. Trust is important in relationships, and if the author is resorting to snooping, that could be a problem. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship based on the content, not the method of discovery.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend disrespects him by using the term, and thus the friendship should end. But is it the friend's fault, or the girlfriend's for not addressing it? The friend might not have intended harm, but the author sees it as a personal disrespect. Whether the author is overreacting depends on cultural context and relationship norms. Some might say the friend's joke was inconsiderate, others might think it's trivial.\n\nThe girlfriend's history of deleting messages and the author's trust issues complicate things. If the author is already in a controlling or distrustful mindset, that could be a bigger issue than the friend's comment. But the question is specifically about the action of cutting off the friend. \n\nIn summary, the author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected, but the method of finding out and the level of control might indicate deeper relationship issues. However, the direct action (ending the friendship) is a personal boundary in the relationship. So whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether calling someone a \"work boyfriend\" is a valid reason to end a friendship. Some might see it as a minor issue, others as a sign of disrespect. The answer is probably B (No), but there are nuances."
