She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend (GF) has been friends with a coworker (Sam) for over three years. The GF tells the author that Sam doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with her. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the GF deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, the author found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the GF he doesn't want her to be friends with that person anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a work context is a big enough issue to end a friendship. The author is asserting that the friend's comment shows a lack of respect for their relationship. But is that a reasonable response?\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some workplaces, people use \"work husbands\" or \"work boyfriends\" as jokes to describe friendly male colleagues. It's not necessarily romantic. The friend might have been using a casual term without any intention to offend. The GF might not have seen it as an issue since she ignored the message and moved on. The author, however, is taking it seriously.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as overreacting if the term is commonly used in a non-romantic way. However, if the author feels it's a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, that's his right. But cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke might be too harsh, especially if the GF didn't take it seriously and the friend didn't intend harm.\n\nThe author's method of finding out the messages\u2014using the Fitbit to track deleted texts\u2014raises questions about trust and privacy. Even though the GF deleted messages, the author used a third-party device to access them. This could be seen as invasive, which might contribute to the friend's lack of respect for the relationship if the friend found out about such methods.\n\nAlso, the author is making a judgment about the friend's intentions based on a single message. The friend might not have meant anything by it. The author is assuming malice where there might be none. The GF's friend might not have realized the term was an issue, and the GF might have already addressed it by ignoring the message.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings with the GF first before cutting off the friend. Instead, he unilaterally decided to end the friendship, which could be seen as controlling or possessive. The GF might feel that her autonomy in friendships is being undermined without her input.\n\nAdditionally, the author's history of going through each other's phones suggests a lack of mutual trust. This behavior could be contributing to the tension. The fact that both are checking each other's phones indicates a foundational issue in the relationship, which might be affecting how they handle this situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the casual use of \"boyfriend\" in the workplace, the author's invasion of privacy via Fitbit, the lack of communication with the GF about his decision, and the potential overreaction to a minor issue, it seems like the author is overstepping. He's making a judgment about the friend's intentions without sufficient evidence and cutting off a long-time friend based on a single joke, which might not warrant such a severe action. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
