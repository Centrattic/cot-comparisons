She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, and he's upset that she's friends with a coworker of hers named Sam. The coworker, Sam, isn't close to many people at work, but he interacts with the girlfriend. The author initially was okay with this, but then he finds out that the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend\" in a message to the girlfriend. The author got this info by checking the Fitbit message before she deleted it. Then he told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with her anymore because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The friend called someone else \"boyfriend\" in a message to the girlfriend. The girlfriend said she ignored it, but the author is upset. The author is making a big deal out of this, cutting off the friendship. The question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his boundaries as a partner. He feels that the friend's comment was disrespectful. Maybe he's worried about how the friend refers to others in a romantic context when she's friends with the girlfriend. But on the other hand, the friend might have been joking, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is acting on a deleted message he found through a rather sneaky method (using the Fitbit to see deleted messages), which might indicate a lack of trust. Even though he says he trusts her, the fact that he resorted to checking her messages through the Fitbit shows some level of mistrust. Also, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be a harsh reaction. Maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it, and the author is overreacting. The girlfriend's friend might not realize that the term \"boyfriend\" is problematic in this context. It's possible that the author is projecting his own insecurities. Additionally, the author's method of finding out about the message (using the Fitbit) is a bit underhanded, which could affect how justified his reaction is. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, the author's response of cutting off the friendship entirely might be too extreme. The girlfriend might feel that her friendship is being unfairly targeted. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe the author should have talked to the friend first to address the comment. Or maybe discussed with his girlfriend how to handle situations where friends use such terms. The author's reaction seems immediate and drastic. He didn't give the friend a chance to explain or correct her behavior. Also, the girlfriend mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to anyone much, so maybe the friend's interaction with her is minimal, but the author is still taking it seriously. \n\nIn terms of trust, the author is in a position where he's checking his girlfriend's messages via the Fitbit. That behavior itself might be a red flag. Even if he's not hacking into her phone, using her devices to monitor messages could be seen as invasive. So his method of finding out the message was through a somewhat deceptive route. This might indicate that he's not being entirely honest with his approach, which could affect his standing in the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her friend's actions were trivial, and the author is overreacting. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the term \"boyfriend\" could be a common joke among coworkers. If the author is strict about such terms, maybe he should communicate his boundaries earlier. However, if he's in a relationship, it's reasonable to expect that others don't refer to other people as the girlfriend's partners in a joking manner. \n\nIn terms of the actual action of cutting off the friend, it's a big step. Relationships often require communication and understanding. The author's decision to end the friendship without discussing it with the friend might be too hasty. He could have first addressed the issue with the friend directly or discussed with his girlfriend how to handle it. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he resorted to surveillance (via Fitbit), didn't communicate the issue directly, and cut off the friendship without giving the friend a chance to explain. His reaction is harsh given the context, and the method he used to find out about the message is questionable. Therefore, he might be the asshole here.\n"
