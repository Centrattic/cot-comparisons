She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is the asshole. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend (28) has a friend (let's call her \"Friend A\") who's been working with her for over three years. This Friend A refers to another coworker, Sam, as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through his girlfriend's deleted messages on her Fitbit. He then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Friend A anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship. The author is against jokes about \"work husbands\" and feels that the friend shouldn't have used that term for Sam. The question is, is the author wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue here is the author's reaction to Sam being called his girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had previously mentioned that Sam only interacts with her, but the author trusted her. The friend's comment was a joke, but the author took it seriously and cut off the friendship. \n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. In a relationship, trust is crucial. The author and his girlfriend live together and have been on and off for four years. The friend's joke about Sam might be harmless, but the author sees it as disrespectful. Is it his right to dictate who she can be friends with? That's a common point of contention. \n\nPeople often have \"work husbands\" or \"work wives,\" which are just friendly terms. The friend likely didn't mean any harm. The author's reaction seems extreme because it's a joke, not an actual relationship. But does that justify cutting off a friend? It's possible that the friend's comment was a mistake, and the girlfriend could have addressed it directly. \n\nThe author's method of finding out the messages is also questionable. They go through each other's phones, which is a red flag in relationships. Even if the girlfriend admitted to deleting messages, the act itself (checking Fitbit) shows a lack of trust. The author might be overstepping by using this as a reason to end the friendship. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she might feel that the author is being controlling. She had a long-time friend, and an offhand joke shouldn't necessarily lead to losing a friend. Also, the author's approach of cutting off the friend after finding out through deleted messages could be seen as harsh. Healthy communication between the couple would be better than immediate friend removal. \n\nThe author's justification is that the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship. But the friend's comment was probably not intended to be disrespectful. The girlfriend did ignore the message and move on, which she might have handled. However, the author is now taking it upon himself to punish her for not addressing it further. \n\nSo, the main factors here are the author's lack of trust (checking phones), overreacting to a joke, and possibly being controlling about his girlfriend's friendships. On the other hand, the friend's comment was likely innocent, and the couple should have discussed the issue first before taking drastic actions. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions seem to stem from jealousy and a breach of trust, which are common in relationships but handled poorly here. The answer would be that the author is the asshole because he's being controlling and overreacting to a minor issue without proper communication.\n"
