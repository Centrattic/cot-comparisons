She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years. The author is okay with the friend because the coworker (Sam) is just a co-worker and not interacting much with others. The main issue is when the friend refers to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful.\n\nThe author found out through the Fitbit messages that the friend made this comment. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the author isn't okay with the friend making such jokes. He then decides to end the friendship, arguing that the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author is in a long-term relationship with the girlfriend, they live together, and there's a history of on-and-off periods. Trust might be an issue here. The author is upset because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, which he interprets as a personal disrespect. However, the friend might not have intended it as a serious slight, just a joke or a work-related term.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The author's reaction is based on his own boundaries about how others refer to partners. \n2. The friend's comment might be seen as a joke or work-related teasing. \n3. The girlfriend didn't respond to the comment, which might indicate she found it trivial.\n4. The author's method of finding out (using Fitbit) raises questions about trust and privacy, but the user's focus is on the decision to cut off the friend.\n\nIs cutting off the friend over a joke disproportionate? It depends on the relationship. If the author feels that the friend's actions disrespect their relationship, he has the right to set boundaries. However, the severity of the reaction (ending the friendship) might be too harsh for a one-time joke. The friend might not have realized the term was offensive, and the girlfriend might see it as a minor issue. \n\nAlso, the author's trust in the girlfriend's judgment is important. If she's been friends with her for years and she dismisses the comment, maybe the author is overreacting. The question is whether the author has the right to dictate who his partner can be friends with. Relationships involve boundaries, but cutting off a friend over a joke might be too extreme unless there's a pattern of behavior.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author is acting on his feelings of disrespect, but the action of cutting off the friend entirely might not be justified if it's a single, minor incident. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the reaction is disproportionate and he's imposing his standards without considering the context of the friend's intent and the girlfriend's perspective.\n"
