She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with her interacting with the coworker, who doesn't talk to many people at work. The issue arises when the friend refers to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages and Fitbit data, then told his girlfriend to end the friendship because he felt disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend claims she ignored it. The author's reaction seems to be about boundaries in the relationship. The key points: the friend's joke might not have been intended to cause harm, but the author feels it's a boundary crossed. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment, which could have been a chance to clear up any misunderstandings. However, the author's response is to end the friendship entirely, which is a significant step. The question is whether this reaction is justified. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, the author might feel that the friend doesn't respect their relationship, but the friend's action was a joke. The girlfriend's friend might not have realized the implications, and cutting off the friendship without addressing the issue might be seen as overly harsh. \n\nThe author's decision to not allow the friendship anymore could be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend didn't intend to harm the relationship. The girlfriend might feel that her social life is being restricted without proper discussion. However, the author's perspective is that the friend's joke disrespected him as the partner.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the friend's comment was a joke, the girlfriend didn't address it, and the author's reaction is cutting off the friendship. The author's action might be seen as too extreme, hence possibly in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author feels that any such references are unacceptable, his stance is about relationship boundaries. But the method of cutting off the friend without understanding the context or giving the friend a chance to explain could be problematic. \n\nMaybe the author's approach is too harsh. The friend might not have meant any harm, and the girlfriend's deletion of messages might have caused unnecessary tension. The author could have approached the girlfriend to discuss the situation instead of immediately ending the friendship. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the extreme reaction without proper communication with the friend.\n"
