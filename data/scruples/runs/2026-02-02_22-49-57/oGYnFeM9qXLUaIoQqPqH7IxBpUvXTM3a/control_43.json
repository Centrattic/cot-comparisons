She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is an asshole for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years. The friend called another guy (Sam) her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The author found out through the girlfriend's Fitbit messages (she deleted the texts but the Fitbit kept them). The author then told the girlfriend to cut off the friend because she \"doesn't respect us as a couple\".\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust, communication, and the seriousness of the situation. The girlfriend didn't think the friend's comment was a big deal\u2014she just ignored it. The author, however, sees it as disrespectful and a boundary crossed. \n\nIs the author right to be upset? Well, if the friend is using the term \"boyfriend\" in a joking way, maybe it's not serious. But if it's being used in a context that's misleading or makes the author feel disrespected, that's a problem. The girlfriend didn't address it with the friend either, which adds to the problem. \n\nBut cutting off a three-year friend over one message seems extreme. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship. Also, the author used the Fitbit to read deleted messages, which could indicate trust issues. However, the fact that the girlfriend deleted messages might have given the author reason to be concerned about transparency.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the author felt the term \"boyfriend\" was inappropriate, he should have discussed it with the girlfriend first. Cutting off the friend without addressing the friend or giving the girlfriend a chance to handle it might be overreacting. Also, the author's approach seems based on mistrust, which could have been handled better with communication. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend repeatedly made such comments, it would be different. But this was a one-time thing. The author's reaction might be too harsh. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because he didn't approach it with an open mind or give the girlfriend a chance to resolve it. The answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
