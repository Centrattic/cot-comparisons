She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author and his girlfriend live together and have been on and off for four years. She's been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially because he trusted her.\n\nThe main issue comes up when the author finds out that the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The author then decides the friendship should end because he feels disrespected. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. The friend's message was a joke, and the GF said she ignored it and moved on. The author is upset because he doesn't think the GF addressed it and doesn't like the term \"work husband\" or any similar terms.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries, trust, and communication. The author's reaction is based on his discomfort with the label applied by the friend. However, the GF didn't engage with the joke and might have thought it was harmless. The author decides to end the friendship without the GF's input, which might be a problem. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to be upset? Maybe. He has a right to feel disrespected if he doesn't like the term. But cutting off a friend solely based on one joke could be seen as overreacting, especially if the GF wasn't involved in the joke and addressed it by moving on. Also, the author used her Fitbit to monitor her, which might indicate an issue with trust and privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend might not have intended harm. If the GF didn't find the term offensive and didn't reciprocate, maybe the author shouldn't impose his views on her friendships. Additionally, the author's approach of cutting off the friend without discussing it with her first might be too harsh, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author has communicated his boundaries before and the friend continued to use such terms despite knowing the GF's partner's preferences, then maybe the author is justified. But in this case, there's no indication that the GF had previously told her friend not to use that term. The GF herself didn't confront the friend, so the author stepping in could be his way of enforcing their relationship's boundaries.\n\nHowever, the method of using the Fitbit to catch deleted messages might not be healthy. It could be seen as invasive and might erode trust. The author's reaction might be more about his insecurity or past issues rather than the friend's actual actions. \n\nIn terms of general advice, relationships require communication. Instead of cutting off the friend, the author should have discussed his feelings with his GF and allowed her to address the issue with her friend. Forcing a friendship to end based on a single joke could be seen as controlling, especially if the GF didn't see it as a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be based on valid feelings of being disrespected, but the way he handled it could be problematic. Cutting off a friend over a minor issue without proper communication might make him the asshole here. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because the approach is heavy-handed and possibly invasive, but there's a case for B if the boundary about terms of endearment is important to him and the GF didn't address it. But considering typical AITA dynamics, usually, cutting off someone else's friend based on a joke is seen as the asshole move unless there's a clear prior agreement about such terms.\n"
