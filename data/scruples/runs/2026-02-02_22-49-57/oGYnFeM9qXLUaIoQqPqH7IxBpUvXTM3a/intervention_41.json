She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been on and off for four years and live together now. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (Sam) for three years. The author was okay with her being friends with Sam initially, as he didn't interact much with others. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit that one of the deleted messages was a friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend didn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found offensive. The author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to uncover the deleted messages, which might be a red flag about trust. The author then cut off the friendship, claiming it's about respect for the relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. The author's stance is that even joking about someone being a \"boyfriend\" in the workplace is a boundary they don't accept. However, the friend might just be using workplace lingo, which is common in some offices. The girlfriend might have explained that it's innocent, but the author didn't give her a chance to address it directly. Instead, the author cut off the friendship without the girlfriend's input, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author resorted to checking the Fitbit for deleted messages suggests a lack of trust. Even though the girlfriend was hiding messages, the method of finding out might affect the credibility of the author's actions. The girlfriend might feel that the author violated her privacy and made a decision without proper discussion.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed the issue with the girlfriend, expressed their discomfort with the term \"boyfriend\" applied to someone else, and talked about boundaries with the friend. Instead, cutting off the friend unilaterally might be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy in maintaining her friendships. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's friend might not have intended any disrespect. The term \"boyfriend\" in a workplace context can be a casual term for a close colleague, especially if they're both single and the friendship is platonic. The author's assumption that it's a joke or disrespectful might be jumping to conclusions without understanding the actual context.\n\nSo, while the author might feel wronged by the friend's comment, the approach taken\u2014cutting off the friend without discussion and using invasive methods to uncover the issue\u2014could be seen as the AITA here. The author's actions might infringe on the girlfriend's ability to manage her own relationships and could create unnecessary conflict. The balance between respecting a partner's relationships and expressing one's own boundaries is delicate, and it seems the author leaned too far into control in this case.\n"
