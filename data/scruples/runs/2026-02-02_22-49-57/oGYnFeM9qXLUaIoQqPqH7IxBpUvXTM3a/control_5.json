She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the guy (the author) is upset because his girlfriend's friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The author then demands that the girlfriend stop being friends with that person. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has been friends with this woman for over three years. They work together, and there's a co-worker named Sam who only interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initial interaction. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages, and through her Fitbit, the author found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The author is acting out of jealousy, even though he claims to be concerned about respect. The girlfriend's friend made a joke or a comment referring to Sam as her boyfriend, which the girlfriend dismissed. The author is taking a strict stance against any such references, even if they're innocent. \n\nI need to think about boundaries in relationships. Is it reasonable for the author to cut off a long-time friend over a joke? The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend might not see the comment as a big deal. The author is using a deleted message as a reason to end the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. Also, the author is controlling by checking the girlfriend's phone and using the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. That behavior can be problematic and might contribute to the girlfriend's actions (deleting messages). \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the author and girlfriend discuss the issue before cutting off the friend? The author says he told the girlfriend to stop being friends, which is a big step. It might have been better to address the comment with the friend first or talk about boundaries together. The author's approach seems abrupt and possibly controlling. \n\nHowever, the author might believe that the friend's comment is a sign of disrespect towards their relationship. But calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a work context could be a harmless joke, especially if there's no actual romantic relationship. The author's stance against \"work husbands\" or similar terms might be too strict, and cutting off a friend over that could be seen as extreme. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he's overreacting, using controlling behavior to monitor his girlfriend, and cutting off a friend based on a minor issue without proper communication. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended harm, and the author's response is disproportionate.\n"
