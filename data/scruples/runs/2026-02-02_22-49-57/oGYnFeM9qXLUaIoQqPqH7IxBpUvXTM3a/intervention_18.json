She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with a co-worker, a guy named Sam, and the friend called this guy her \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through deleted messages that the friend made that comment and then decides the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with her anymore.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which he finds disrespectful. He trusts his girlfriend but is upset about the friend's comment. He also mentions that they go through each other's phones, which might complicate things. The girlfriend deleted messages, but he found out via her Fitbit. He confronts her and then tells her to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. It's common for people to have friends at work. The friend's comment might be seen as a joke, but the author takes it seriously. However, cutting off a friend over a single comment could be a big reaction. The author is enforcing his own boundaries, but is that reasonable?\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the friend's comment isn't a valid reason to lose a friend, especially if it was a joke. The author's approach might come off as controlling, especially since he used her Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. That shows he's been monitoring her without her knowledge, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nAlso, the friend might not have intended any harm by calling Sam her boyfriend. The author is assuming malice where there might be none. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it and just moved on, so maybe the issue isn't with the friend but with the author's perception.\n\nSo, the author's reaction seems extreme. Using passive-aggressive tactics (like the Fitbit) and cutting off a friend over a joke could be seen as overstepping. The author is in the wrong because he's making a big deal out of a minor issue and invading his girlfriend's privacy to do so.\n"
