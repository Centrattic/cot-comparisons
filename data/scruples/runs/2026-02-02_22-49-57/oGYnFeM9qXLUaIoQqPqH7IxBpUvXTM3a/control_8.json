She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has been friends with this co-worker for three years. The author was okay with the friendship initially, trusting his girlfriend. Then, he finds out that the friend referred to another man as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message. The girlfriend deleted messages, but he discovered them via her Fitbit. He confronts her, and now he wants her to stop being friends with this coworker because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and how to handle jealousy or insecurity. The author's main issue is the friend's use of a term that implies a romantic relationship with someone else. However, the friend might have been using a casual term, like a \"work husband,\" which is common in some workplaces. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, and the author is now cutting off the friend because of that one instance.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a friend over a single joke or casual reference might be overreacting. The friend didn't engage with the comment, so there's no evidence she encouraged it. The author's approach seems controlling, especially since he's using the discovery via Fitbit as leverage. Trust is a big factor here; the author initially trusted the girlfriend's judgment about the friendship but now is acting on suspicion without clear evidence of wrongdoing. Also, using the Fitbit to monitor messages could be seen as invasive. \n\nThe author's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than the friend's actual actions. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend didn't respond. The author's decision to end the friendship without addressing it directly with the friend or discussing boundaries with his girlfriend could be seen as disproportionate. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect, and cutting someone off without clear communication might be harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his response is excessive and not based on the friend's actions directly, but on his own insecurities and over-monitoring.\n"
