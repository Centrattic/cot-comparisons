She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another co-worker as her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The author initially was okay with the friendship, even though the co-worker (Sam) only interacts a bit with her. The main issue arises when the friend calls another co-worker \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as a serious breach.\n\nThe girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. He then confronts her, and she tells him she ignored the message. The author then demands the relationship with the friend end because the friend doesn't respect him or the couple.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships: Partners should communicate their expectations. The author didn't like the term \"boyfriend\" being used, which could be seen as a pettiness. However, if the friend was joking or using a term common in their workplace (like \"work husband\"), that's different. The author's reaction seems extreme\u2014cutting off a three-year friendship over a single message. Also, he's using the girlfriend's deleted messages as leverage, which might not be healthy. Trust is a big factor here; the author trusted her initially but then acted unilaterally. The girlfriend might feel this is controlling. On the other hand, the friend's comment could be seen as inappropriate if it's not just a joke. But the author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize. He just cut off the friendship. So, the author's actions are probably overreacting and not allowing for open communication. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
