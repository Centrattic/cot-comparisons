She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been together for three months but had a four-year on-again-off-again relationship. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially because the girlfriend trusted that Sam only interacted with her. \n\nThen there's the part about the Fitbit. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the Fitbit retained them. The author used this to confront her, and she admitted to ignoring a message where the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to cut off the friend because the friend doesn't respect the relationship. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable. The author is not okay with \"work husbands\" or jokes about that. The girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment, which the author sees as her not setting boundaries, leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, relationships require communication and trust. The author's response seems extreme\u2014cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke. The girlfriend's friend might have made a harmless joke, and the girlfriend didn't take issue with it. The author is taking it upon himself to end the friendship without discussing it with her or understanding the context. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to snoop, which might have been a breach of trust. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, the method of using the Fitbit to find out could be seen as invasive. The author's actions might be more about control than about the actual issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comment could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend's partner is uncomfortable with such terms. However, cutting off a friend entirely over one instance seems harsh. The author is making a judgment about the friend's respect for the relationship without knowing the full story. The girlfriend might have had a different perspective on the friend's comment. \n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy and mistrust, possibly overreacting. The appropriate step would be to discuss boundaries with the girlfriend and let her handle the situation, not to dictate her friendships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
