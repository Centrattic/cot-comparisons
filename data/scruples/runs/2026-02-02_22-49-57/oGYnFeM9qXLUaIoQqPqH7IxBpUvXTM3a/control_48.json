She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author was initially okay with the relationship because the coworker, Sam, doesn't interact much with others. But then the author finds out via the Fitbit messages that the friend referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The author then decides the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship and wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her.\n\nHmm, so the main points are: The friend made a joke about a coworker being her boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't think it was a big deal and moved on. The author, however, is upset and wants the friendship cut off. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the friend's comment was a joke, but the author is taking it seriously. The girlfriend didn't engage with the joke, just moved on. The author is using this incident to end the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. Also, the author is using the Fitbit messages to uncover deleted texts, which might indicate an invasion of privacy. \n\nBut the author might argue that he's standing up for the relationship. However, the friend's comment was a joke, not a serious declaration of a relationship. The author is cutting off the friend without addressing it with her first, which might be abrupt. The girlfriend's reaction was to ignore the message, so maybe the author is imposing his own standards without discussing it first.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, trust and communication are key. The author didn't talk to the friend directly but decided to end the friendship based on a single joke. That could be seen as impulsive. Also, the method of finding out via Fitbit might not be a healthy approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be viewed as overstepping. The friend's joke doesn't necessarily warrant ending a three-year friendship. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend and maybe the friend, rather than making a unilateral decision. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
