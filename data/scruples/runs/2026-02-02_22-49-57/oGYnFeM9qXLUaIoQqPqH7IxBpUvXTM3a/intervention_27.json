She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the coworker (Sam) waving at her and being the only one he interacts with. So initially, there's no issue. The problem arises when the friend refers to another guy as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message that the girlfriend deleted. The author found out via the Fitbit messages that the friend made this comment. The girlfriend claims she ignored it, but the author is upset that the friend made the joke and decides to end the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The friend's joke might be innocent, as the girlfriend says Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. The author is being very controlling by cutting off the friend over a single joke. The girlfriend didn't even confront the friend about it, just moved on. The author is acting on information he got through a sneaky method (Fitbit messages), which might indicate a lack of trust. Also, cutting off a long-time friend over a minor incident seems harsh. The author's reaction might be disproportionate. The friend didn't do anything wrong intentionally, and the girlfriend didn't act in a way that was deceptive. The author is being possessive and not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected and wants boundaries. However, the way he handled it\u2014cutting off the friend without discussing it with his girlfriend first\u2014might be the issue. The real problem could be the author's trust issues and his method of finding out the information rather than addressing it openly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is being controlling and overreacting. The friend's comment was a joke, and cutting off someone over that is excessive. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
