She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was okay with the coworker (Sam) having a limited interaction with her, like waving. Then, a friend of the girlfriend refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" in a message that was deleted but uncovered through the Fitbit. The author then demands the girlfriend end the friendship because the friend \"doesn't respect him as the man and their couple.\"\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend's comment was likely a joke or casual term, common in workplaces. The author is taking it seriously and cutting off the friend. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, and she didn't know her Fitbit messages were still accessible. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. But in some contexts, people might use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" jokingly. The author is strict about not allowing such terms. The girlfriend tried to move on from the message, but the author is holding onto it as a reason to end the friendship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a friend over a single joke or misstep might be too harsh. The friend didn't intend any harm, and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author is being controlling by dictating who his girlfriend can be friends with based on a minor incident. The girlfriend's friend didn't realize the message was being read, and the author is using that as leverage. \n\nAlso, the author is in a position where he's using the girlfriend's Fitbit to find deleted messages, which might indicate a lack of trust. Even if the author found out through the Fitbit, punishing the friend by cutting them off seems excessive. The friend didn't directly address the author, so their lack of respect isn't towards him personally. The author is projecting his own discomfort onto the friend. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend's comment was a private message, and the author is taking it out of context. The friend might not have realized the term could be offensive in this situation. The author's response is cutting off the friendship entirely, which is a significant consequence for a single, possibly innocent message. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk to the friend directly about the issue but instead decided unilaterally to end the friendship. That seems like an overreaction. The author might be acting out of jealousy or insecurity, but that doesn't justify cutting off someone else's friend without giving them a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is being overly controlling and reactive. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's taking a harsh stance over a minor issue that didn't directly involve him, without addressing it directly with the friend first.\n"
