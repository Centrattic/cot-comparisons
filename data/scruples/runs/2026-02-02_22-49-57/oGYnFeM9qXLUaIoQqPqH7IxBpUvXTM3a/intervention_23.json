She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out via the girlfriend's Fitbit that she deleted messages. The messages mentioned \"Sam\" as her boyfriend. The friend had used the term \"boyfriend\" in a joke. The boyfriend then told the girlfriend not to be friends anymore with her friend because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether using the term \"boyfriend\" is crossing a line. The girlfriend had been friends with this person for 3+ years. The boyfriend is upset that the friend used that term, even if it's a joke. He's also using the deleted messages as a reason to cut off the friendship. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship. But is cutting off a friend over a joke appropriate? The girlfriend didn't engage with the message; she moved on. The friend might just be joking, as the boyfriend acknowledges, but he's not okay with it. \n\nThe boyfriend is acting based on jealousy, maybe. But is it fair to end a friendship over a term that could be seen as a joke? The girlfriend might feel like the boyfriend is overreacting. Also, he used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages, which adds complexity. The trust issue here is important. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If the boyfriend was uncomfortable with the term, he should have addressed it with his girlfriend first. Cutting off the friend immediately might be harsh, especially if the friend didn't mean any harm. The boyfriend is acting out of insecurity, possibly, which is a personal issue but shouldn't lead to cutting off a friend without discussion.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions might be seen as overreacting. He's not wrong in feeling upset, but cutting off the friendship entirely without understanding the context or discussing it with his girlfriend might be inconsiderate. The friend's use of the term might not be malicious, and the girlfriend's decision not to engage could be sufficient. The boyfriend's approach might be more about his own insecurities than the actual harm done. Therefore, he could be the asshole here.\n"
