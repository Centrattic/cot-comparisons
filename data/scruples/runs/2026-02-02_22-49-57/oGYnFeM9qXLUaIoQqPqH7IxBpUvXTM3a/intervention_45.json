She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who's been friends with a coworker for three years. The guy (the author) finds out that the coworker called another co-worker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which he takes issue with. He then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with that coworker anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the coworker (Sam) have been interacting at work for three years. The author was okay with it initially because he trusted her. The main issue arises when the coworker refers to another man as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author used the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages and then confronted the girlfriend. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through the Fitbit. The coworker's comment might be a joke, but the author sees it as disrespectful. He's cutting off the friendship because of that. \n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction might be seen as overstepping. The coworker might have been joking, and the girlfriend didn't engage in the comment. The author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) could be seen as invasive, even if he didn't hack her phone. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and maybe the author's lack of trust is causing him to act without fully understanding the context of the coworker's comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel disrespected by the coworker's actions. He might perceive that the coworker is mocking the relationship by using the term \"boyfriend\" inappropriately. The fact that the girlfriend didn't address the comment might lead him to believe she's not standing up for their relationship. \n\nBut cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke could be extreme. The coworker might not have intended any disrespect, and the girlfriend's friendship might be genuine. The author's approach seems to be controlling, based on his own interpretation of the situation without discussing it with the coworker first. \n\nAlso, the author's method of uncovering the messages through the Fitbit, even if unintentional, could be seen as a breach of privacy. The girlfriend might feel violated, especially if she thought her messages were deleted. This could erode trust in their relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his concerns with his girlfriend first, perhaps encouraging her to address the coworker's comment rather than cutting off the friendship abruptly. By doing so, he might have approached the situation more constructively. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions might be seen as excessive. He's making a judgment based on a single incident and using surveillance (even if through a Fitbit) to monitor his girlfriend, which could be a breach of trust. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But some might argue that he's justified in feeling disrespected and acting to protect the relationship. However, the way he's handling it is problematic. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his reaction is too harsh and controlling.\n"
