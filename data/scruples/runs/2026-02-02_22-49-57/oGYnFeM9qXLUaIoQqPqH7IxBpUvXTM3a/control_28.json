She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend\". \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for 3+ years. The author allowed the relationship initially because the girlfriend said the coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to anyone much. But then there's an incident where the friend refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" in a message, which the girlfriend deleted. The author found out through the Fitbit messages and confronted her. He then decided to end the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's main issue is the friend calling Sam her boyfriend. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message. The author is upset that the friend didn't respect the relationship and cut off the friend. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment might be seen as a joke or a work-related term, but it's disrespectful. The author is within his rights to feel that way in a relationship. However, cutting off a friend based on one message might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended anything serious, and the girlfriend's friend's actions might not warrant ending the friendship. Also, the girlfriend might be losing a friend over something that wasn't her fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to set boundaries in the relationship. If he doesn't want his partner to be called someone else's boyfriend, even in a joking manner, then he's trying to protect the relationship. The author's actions are based on his feelings about being disrespected. However, the way he found out (through deleted messages and the Fitbit) might imply some level of mistrust, which could be a red flag in itself.\n\nBut the main issue is whether cutting off the friend is justified. The friend's comment was a one-time joke. The author is taking it as a sign that the friend doesn't respect the relationship. But maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it. The author's reaction seems extreme. Relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of cutting off the friend, discussing boundaries with the friend might have been a better approach.\n\nSo, the author is acting out of his feelings but is making a drastic decision without fully understanding the context. The friend might not have intended to disrespect them, and the girlfriend might be losing a friendship over a misunderstanding. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend based on a single message without addressing it with the friend first.\n"
