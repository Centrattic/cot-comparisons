She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, which the author found out about through her Fitbit. The key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author discovered that the friend referred to a co-worker as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which upset them. They then decided to end the friendship because they felt disrespected. The girlfriend had previously mentioned that this co-worker (Sam) only interacted with her and others at work, so the author was somewhat okay with it initially. But the friend's comment crossed a line in the author's eyes.\n\nThe author's main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend,\" implying a relationship where there isn't one. The author believes the girlfriend should have addressed this with her friend and that the friend doesn't respect their relationship. The question is whether the author is justified in cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's reaction might be seen as a boundary issue. If the friend's comment was a joke, maybe the author overreacted. However, if the author felt it was inappropriate and the girlfriend didn't address it, maybe the author has a right to be upset. The problem is whether cutting off the friend entirely is an appropriate response. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend deleted messages, which led the author to uncover this. The author used the Fitbit to find out, which raises questions about privacy and trust. However, the user's main query is about the friend being cut off, not the phone-checking issue. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have expected the girlfriend to handle the friend's comment directly. If the friend made such a statement, it could be a breach of boundaries, especially if the workplace is a professional setting. The author's action could be seen as protecting their relationship's boundaries. However, ending a friendship based solely on one comment might be too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's action might be considered a minor joke, and the author's reaction could be overstepping. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended any harm, and the author cutting her off without giving her a chance to explain could be seen as the author being controlling. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the friend's action was a joke or intentional disrespect. Since the friend called someone else the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" it's a boundary issue. If the author communicated this to the friend and gave her a chance to address it, maybe it would be fair. But cutting off the friendship entirely without discussion might be too extreme. The author's approach might be seen as controlling and lacking in communication, making them the asshole. So, Answer A (the author is in the wrong) might be appropriate here.\n"
