She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after she called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend referred to a male coworker (Sam) as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author took issue with. The author discovered this through the girlfriend deleting messages, which he found out via her Fitbit. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as her boyfriend.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. But the girlfriend didn't take the bait and just moved on. The author seems to be enforcing a rule about how his partner interacts with friends, especially in a professional setting.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The girlfriend was honest about deleting messages, but the author used the Fitbit to find out. That might be a red flag in terms of trust. However, the main issue is the friend's comment. Is it the author's place to dictate who his girlfriend can be friends with? In relationships, it's common to discuss boundaries, but cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend handled it by ignoring it. The author's reaction seems possessive. Healthy relationships allow partners autonomy in friendships unless there's a pattern of inappropriate behavior. Here, it's a one-time joke. The author might be overreacting, which could make him the asshole. But some might argue he's setting boundaries. However, cutting off the friend entirely without giving her a chance to address the comment is extreme. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
