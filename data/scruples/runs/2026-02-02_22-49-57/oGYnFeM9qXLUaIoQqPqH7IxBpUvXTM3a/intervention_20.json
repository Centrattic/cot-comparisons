She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some jealousy and control issues.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has a long-time friend who referred to another male coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through some sneaky methods (checking Fitbit messages) that this happened. He then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because they don't respect him.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The author is upset that the friend used a term that implies a romantic relationship, which he doesn't like. But is it fair to cut off the friend entirely over one joke? The friend might not have realized it was a problem, and the girlfriend didn't know she said it. Also, the author used deceptive tactics to find out about the messages, which shows a lack of trust and possibly overstepping.\n\nThe author claims he's not okay with \"work husbands\" or jokes like that. But communication could have been better. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe discussing his feelings with his girlfriend and setting boundaries together would be healthier. Cutting off someone over a single instance might be too harsh, especially if the friend didn't intend harm. Also, the girlfriend didn't engage with the message, so she didn't act on it. \n\nThe author's approach seems controlling. Trust issues are valid, but reacting by ending a friendship that's been there for three years might not be justified. It's possible the friend didn't mean anything by it, and the author is overreacting. The method of finding out (using Fitbit) also indicates a lack of trust, which can harm the relationship. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings about being called a \"boyfriend\" are understandable, his response might be the problem. Cutting off the friend without considering the context or giving her a chance to address it is probably excessive. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because his reaction is too severe and controlling.\n"
