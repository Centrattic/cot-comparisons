She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for over three years. The friend refers to a male coworker (Sam) as \"her boyfriend,\" even though the girlfriend's boyfriend is the author. The author finds out through deleted messages and the Fitbit, then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. The friend's comment is the issue. The friend is using a term that implies a romantic relationship with someone else, which the author finds disrespectful.\n2. The author's reaction is to end the friendship. The girlfriend may not have done anything wrong herself, just didn't correct the friend.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. It's common for people to have outside friendships, and sometimes friends might use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as jokes. However, the author is uncomfortable with any term that could imply a romantic relationship in their context. The friend's use of \"boyfriend\" in a professional setting could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's a regular occurrence and not just a one-time joke.\n\nThe author's method of finding out (through deleted messages and Fitbit) might be questionable, but the user's question is about whether the author is wrong for cutting the friend off. The author believes the friend doesn't respect the relationship, and the girlfriend didn't correct the friend's comment. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author might feel that the friend's continued use of such terms undermines their relationship. However, cutting off a long-time friend over one comment might be too harsh. The friend might have meant it as a joke, and the girlfriend might not have encouraged it. But the author's feelings are valid\u2014feeling disrespected by someone in their partner's life is a real issue.\n\nOn the other hand, ending a friendship based on a single message could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended harm, and the girlfriend didn't act on the message. The author's approach could damage the girlfriend's autonomy in maintaining her social circle.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions are driven by their feelings of insecurity or disrespect, which are valid. However, cutting off someone without giving them a chance to address or correct their behavior might not be fair. The appropriate response might have been to discuss the issue with the girlfriend and have her address the friend, rather than ending the friendship outright.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for taking such a drastic step based on one instance, even if the friend's comment was inappropriate. The solution could have involved communication with the friend rather than immediate cutoff.\n"
