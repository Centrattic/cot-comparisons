She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the boyfriend (the author) is upset because his girlfriend has a friend who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years, and the author is now cutting off that friendship because he thinks the friend disrespects him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The friend mentioned someone as \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes issue with. The girlfriend says she ignored the message. The author found out through the Fitbit that she deleted messages and then confronted her. Now, he's telling her she can't be friends with this person anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for a co-worker. That could be a work-related term, like a friendly nickname, which might not be serious. The author is assuming that this is a problem and cutting off the friendship. But is that overreacting?\n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't talk to the friend directly to understand the context. He just decided the friend doesn't respect him and ended the friendship. Also, the girlfriend might have a right to her friendships, even if the term \"boyfriend\" was used in a non-romantic way. The author is making a big deal about a joke or a nickname, which could be seen as controlling or not trusting his girlfriend's ability to handle the situation.\n\nAdditionally, the author used the Fitbit to read deleted messages. This could be an invasion of privacy, even if he found out indirectly. The girlfriend might feel violated, which adds to the tension. The author's reaction seems extreme for a situation that might not have been malicious. The friend might not have intended any harm, and cutting the friendship off entirely is a harsh response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid feelings about being disrespected. If he's uncomfortable with the term, he should have discussed it with his girlfriend first. Maybe the girlfriend could have addressed it with the friend. But cutting off the friendship without talking to the friend or giving the girlfriend a chance to handle it himself might be overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, not allowing his girlfriend to manage her own friendships. The friend's comment might not have been a big deal, and the author's response is disproportionate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
