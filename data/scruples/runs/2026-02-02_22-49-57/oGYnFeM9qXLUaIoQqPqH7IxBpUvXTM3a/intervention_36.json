She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to stop being friends with her coworker because the coworker called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. Now, he's cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust and boundaries. The girlfriend had a friend she's known for 3+ years, and the author is now cutting off that friendship because of a single instance where the friend referred to another man as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the author is upset regardless. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to be about respect and how the friend addresses others. However, the friend might not have intended malice; sometimes people use terms like \"boyfriend\" in a casual, non-romantic way, especially in workplaces. The author is taking it as a personal slight, which might be a stretch if the friend didn't mean it that way. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the author discovering deleted messages through the Fitbit. He used this information to confront her, which might have contributed to the situation. The girlfriend felt she had to explain messages she deleted, but it's unclear if the friend's comment was meant to be hurtful. \n\nIs cutting off a long-term friend over one joke reasonable? It seems a bit extreme unless there's a history of similar issues. The author is prioritizing his feelings over the girlfriend's established friendship, which could be seen as controlling. Relationships require mutual respect, and the author's reaction might be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend didn't intend to disrespect him. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's honesty about deleting messages is a red flag, but the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might not be ethical either. However, the central issue is the friend's comment. The author's decision to end the friendship based on one instance could be seen as harsh, even if his feelings are valid. So, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friendship without considering the friend's intent or the girlfriend's perspective.\n"
