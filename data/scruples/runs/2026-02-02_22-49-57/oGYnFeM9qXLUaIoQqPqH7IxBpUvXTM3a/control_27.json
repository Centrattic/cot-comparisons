She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author seems okay with the friendship initially, as the girlfriend mentioned the coworker doesn't talk to others much. Then, the author finds out through a Fitbit message that the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with this person, saying they don't respect him as a partner.\n\nThe key points here: The friend making the joke about the coworker being her boyfriend. The author is upset because they don't accept the term \"work husband\" or similar. The girlfriend had the chance to address it but didn't, and the author is now cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Jealousy is common, but cutting off someone over a joke might be too drastic. The author is using the friend's joke as a reason to end the friendship. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend didn't act on it. The author's reaction seems extreme. Also, the girlfriend was hiding messages, but the author is focusing on the friend's joke as the main issue. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, controlling a partner's friendships can be a red flag. The author is making a judgment based on a single message and not giving the friend a chance to explain. The friend's comment could be innocent. The author is also not communicating with the friend directly but instead cutting them off. So, the author's actions might be overstepping. \n\nBut the author might feel that their relationship is being disrespected. However, the right approach would be to talk to the friend first, not cut them off immediately. The girlfriend's responsibility is to address such comments, but the author is taking it upon themselves to end the friendship. So, the author is in the wrong by acting unilaterally and being controlling.\n"
