She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who's accusing his girlfriend's friend of being disrespectful by calling another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a three-year friendship with this coworker, but the guy now wants her to cut off the friend because he feels disrespected.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend called another coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the guy interprets as a joke or a term of endearment, even though he's against such nicknames. The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, including the one mentioned. The guy found out through her Fitbit, which he didn't tell her about, leading to a confrontation where he decided she shouldn't be friends with the coworker anymore.\n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? Well, cutting off someone from a three-year friendship over a single joke might be harsh. The friend didn't address the guy directly, just made a comment about another coworker. The guy's reaction seems extreme\u2014he's not just upset about the nickname but maybe also using this as a reason to control his girlfriend's friendships. Also, the fact that he used the Fitbit to monitor her without her knowing adds to the issue. Trust and communication are key in relationships, and his approach here could be seen as controlling and lacking trust. The girlfriend might have handled the situation by talking to her friend, but the guy's immediate reaction to cut off the friend entirely seems disproportionate. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
