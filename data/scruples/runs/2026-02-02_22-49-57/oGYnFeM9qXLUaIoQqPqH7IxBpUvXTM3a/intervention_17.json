She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's friend, let's call her Jane, called a male coworker, Sam, her \"boyfriend.\" The author discovers this through a deleted message that his girlfriend had erased, but he found via her Fitbit. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author then demands that she stop being friends with Jane because he feels disrespected and doesn't want the term \"boyfriend\" used for someone else.\n\nNow, the key points here. The main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" by Jane. In many workplaces, people might use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as a joke or to describe a friendly relationship without romantic implications. However, the author is taking this very seriously. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend, Jane, used the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to Sam, who is a co-worker. The author's girlfriend had a prior conversation with him about the situation with Sam, explaining that Sam doesn't talk to anyone and only interacts with her. The author was okay with that initially because he trusted her. Now, the issue arises because Jane's use of the term \"boyfriend\" is seen as disrespectful or as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe author's main argument is that Jane doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship. He feels that the term is inappropriate and that the friend shouldn't have used it. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't confront Jane about it, which the author sees as her failing to set boundaries.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting off the friendship? Well, relationships often involve setting boundaries, and partners can have different views on what's acceptable. The author's reaction is based on his feelings of jealousy or insecurity. However, the term \"work boyfriend\" is often used humorously and without romantic connotations. The author might be overreacting if there's no actual romantic relationship between Jane and Sam. Yet, if the term made him uncomfortable and he communicated that to his girlfriend, it's reasonable for him to expect her to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a friend because of a single joke or term might be excessive, especially if there's no prior history of issues. The author's discovery method\u2014using the Fitbit to find deleted messages\u2014could also be problematic, as it involves a breach of privacy. While the girlfriend did delete messages, the author's approach to uncovering them through her Fitbit might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend might feel that the friend's comment was innocent, and cutting her off could damage their friendship unnecessarily. The author's demand to end the friendship based on a single instance might be seen as controlling or not giving Jane a chance to clarify her intentions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable with the term, but his response might be too harsh. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended any disrespect, and cutting off the friendship without addressing the issue directly with Jane could be seen as jumping to conclusions. The author's approach to privacy (using the Fitbit) is also questionable, as it could erode trust further.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not giving Jane a chance to explain, as well as for using surveillance methods to find out about the messages. However, the situation is complex, and both parties have valid points. But given the context, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because cutting off a friend based on a single term without direct communication might be too extreme and the method of discovery is invasive.\n"
