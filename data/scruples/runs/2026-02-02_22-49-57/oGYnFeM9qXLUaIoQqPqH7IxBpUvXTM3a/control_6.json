She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend (GF) has been friends with a coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts with her and others at work. The author trusts her because she said there's nothing going on. Then, they find out via Fitbit messages that the friend referred to Sam as \"her boyfriend,\" but the GF claims she just ignored it. The author then tells her to stop being friends with that person because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overreacted. Let's consider the factors. The friend's comment might be a joke or a misunderstanding. The GF didn't act on it, just ignored the message. The author is cutting off the friend based on a single instance. Is that reasonable?\n\nTrust is a big part here. The author was initially okay with the friendship because the GF said there was nothing there. Now, they're cutting off the friend due to a joke. But the friend might not have meant anything by it. Also, the author's method of finding out through the Fitbit seems underhanded, even if the GF was deleting messages. The author's approach to confronting the friend is abrupt and possibly harsh.\n\nAnother angle: Relationships often involve boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with the term \"boyfriend\" being used, that's valid. However, cutting off a friend over a one-time joke without discussing it with the friend first might be too extreme. The author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize, which could have resolved the issue.\n\nAlso, the GF's actions\u2014deleting messages and lying\u2014might indicate her own issues with transparency. But the author's response (cutting off the friend) might be an overreaction to that. It's possible the friend didn't intend to cross any lines, and the author is reacting more to the GF's possible dishonesty than the friend's actions.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of immediately cutting off the friend, the author should have discussed their feelings with the GF and maybe the friend to address the boundary issues. The author's action might be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a fair chance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without a proper discussion and for possibly overreacting to a single instance. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
