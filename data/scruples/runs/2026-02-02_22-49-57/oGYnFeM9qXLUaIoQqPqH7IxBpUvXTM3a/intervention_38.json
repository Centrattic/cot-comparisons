She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation involves the girlfriend having a friend she's been with for 3+ years. The friend, Sam, has been interacting with her at work, but the girlfriend's friend jokingly refers to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages and a Fitbit message that this happened. He then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with the friend because they don't respect him as her partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The author is upset because the friend made a joke that implies a romantic label on someone else when they aren't a couple. The author feels disrespected and wants to cut off the friend. But is that a reasonable reaction?\n\nThe girlfriend didn't engage with the joke, according to her, and the friend might not have intended any harm. However, the author is using this as a reason to end the friendship. The question is whether cutting off a friend over a single joke is justified. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries. But reacting by cutting off someone else's friend without discussing it might be overreacting. The author could have talked to the friend first to address the joke instead of immediately ending the friendship. Also, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to monitor messages might indicate a lack of trust, which could contribute to the tension.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid (he feels disrespected), the action of cutting off the friend without a proper discussion might be the issue. The friend might not have intended anything beyond a joke, and the author's response could be seen as overly harsh. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the situation more constructively.\n"
