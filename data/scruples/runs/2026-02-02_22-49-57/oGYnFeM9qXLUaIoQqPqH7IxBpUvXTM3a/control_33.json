She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend and her friend who's a coworker. The author, the boyfriend, is upset because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" which he didn't like. He found out through some messages that were deleted but still visible on the Fitbit. Then he told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this coworker anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts with her a bit at work, like waving. The author was okay with that initially. The problem arose when the friend referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author took as a slight against his relationship with his girlfriend. \n\nNow, the author is asking if he's the asshole for cutting off the friendship. Let's break it down. The friend called someone else her boyfriend in a message. The author found out through deleted messages (but the Fitbit had a copy). The girlfriend didn't correct the friend's use of \"boyfriend,\" but she said she ignored the message. The author is now cutting off the friend because of that one comment.\n\nSo, is it reasonable for the author to demand the end of the friendship? Well, in relationships, trust and communication are key. The author might feel that the friend doesn't respect their relationship by using the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else. However, the friend might not have intended any harm, just using a common term for a workplace partner. The girlfriend might think it's harmless, but the author is taking it seriously.\n\nBut here's a catch: the author found out by looking into her Fitbit messages. They mentioned they both go through each other's phones, which might not be healthy. The author used the girlfriend's deleted messages to pressure her. This method of finding out information could be seen as manipulative. The girlfriend might have deleted the messages because she didn't want to discuss it, but the author used the Fitbit as leverage.\n\nThen, the author is ending the friendship over one comment. That seems extreme unless there's a pattern of disrespect. The friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as not respecting him. But maybe the friend didn't mean it to be a romantic term. It's possible it's just a workplace nickname. The author's reaction might be overreacting, especially if this is the first time it's happened and there's no prior issues. \n\nAlso, in relationships, partners should communicate their boundaries. The author might have felt hurt, but instead of discussing it with the friend or the girlfriend, he's cutting off the friend entirely. That could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend might not have realized the term was offensive, so maybe a conversation with the friend would have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author has clear boundaries about not wanting his girlfriend to have terms that imply a relationship with others, then he's within his right to express that. But ending the friendship over one comment might be harsh, especially if the friend didn't realize it was inappropriate. \n\nThe fact that the author is using the deleted messages (found via Fitbit) to justify his reaction might not be the healthiest approach. It could indicate a lack of trust or an overreliance on monitoring, which can strain a relationship. The girlfriend might feel she can't be honest, leading to more issues. \n\nIn summary, while the author has a right to his feelings, ending the friendship over one joke might be too extreme. The method of discovering the message through the Fitbit could be problematic. The healthier approach would be to discuss boundaries with the girlfriend and maybe talk to the friend about why the term was offensive. Cutting off a three-year friendship based on a single, potentially innocent comment might make the author the asshole here."
