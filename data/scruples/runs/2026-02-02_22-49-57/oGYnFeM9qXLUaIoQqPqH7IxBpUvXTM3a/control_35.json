She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend who's been a co-worker for three years. The guy in question, Sam, doesn't really talk to anyone else at work but waves at the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. But then, the girlfriend deleted some messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit that one of the deleted messages was from her friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because they don't respect him as a partner.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The friend called Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable. The author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author is cutting off the friendship because of this one instance. \n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. In a relationship, it's common to have expectations about how your partner interacts with others, especially co-workers. The friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" might be seen as crossing a line, especially if the couple is monogamous and doesn't want their relationship dynamics to be mocked or trivialized by others. The author might feel that the friend is being disrespectful by using that term, implying a relationship that doesn't exist. \n\nHowever, the method the author used to discover this\u2014checking the Fitbit messages\u2014raises some red flags. The girlfriend mentioned they go through each other's phones, but the author used a third-party device's data to uncover deleted messages. This could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the author claims the girlfriend didn't know. The act of using the Fitbit to monitor messages without her knowledge, even if she had previously agreed to phone checks, might be considered invasive. \n\nThen there's the response: cutting off a friendship over one joke. The friend might not have intended malice, and the girlfriend tried to move past it. The author is taking a very strong stance by ending the friendship. Is that proportionate? If the friend's comment was a one-time joke, is it fair to sever the relationship? The author's reaction could be seen as overreacting, especially if there's no history of similar issues.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's role: she might have thought the friend was just joking and didn't realize it would upset her partner. The author's expectation that she should have told the friend it wasn't okay might be reasonable, but she may not have seen it as a big deal. The author's trust in her might be shaken by her deleting messages, even if the content was innocuous. But using the Fitbit as a method to uncover this could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some people might find the term \"work husband\" okay, others don't. The author's stance is that he doesn't want any other man to be called that in his partner's circle. It's a personal boundary, but enforcing it by cutting off a friend could be harsh. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's defending his relationship and setting boundaries. On the other, the method of using the Fitbit could be invasive, and the punishment (cutting off a friend) might be disproportionate to the offense. The friend's comment was a joke, not an actual romantic relationship, and the girlfriend might have handled it by ignoring it. The author's reaction might be seen as controlling or overly possessive, especially if the friend isn't directly harming the relationship. \n\nBut then, in relationships, people have different tolerance levels. If the author truly feels disrespected and doesn't want the term used, it's his right to express that. However, the way he discovered it (through sneaky means) and the immediate removal of the friend might be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit of a toss-up. The author is enforcing his boundaries, but the method and the severity of the punishment could make him the asshole. However, if the friend's comment was a direct jab that the girlfriend didn't address, the author's reaction might be justified. But given that it's a joke and not an actual relationship, and the author's method of finding out was underhanded, it's more likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
