She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her coworker after the coworker called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the background: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jane) for three years. The author was okay with the friendship initially, trusting his girlfriend's assurance that the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to many people and only waves at his girlfriend. The author and girlfriend live together now after four years on and off. \n\nThe key event is when Jane refers to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through a deleted message that the girlfriend didn't tell him about. He uses her Fitbit to check the messages she deleted, then confronts her. He gets her to admit to the situation and tells her he wants their friendship to end because Jane doesn't respect him as a partner.\n\nNow, considering the elements here. The author's actions involve checking her phone through the Fitbit, which seems like invasion of privacy, even if she made it possible by deleting messages. But the main issue is the reaction to the \"boyfriend\" comment. The author is cutting off a friend because of a joke, perhaps, that the friend made. \n\nIs the author right to cut off the friendship? Well, if the girlfriend didn't object to Jane's comment and didn't inform the author, maybe she felt it was harmless. The author's trust was broken because of his own snooping, which complicates things. The author's reaction might be too harsh\u2014cutting off a friend over a single joke, especially if the girlfriend was unaware of the comment. \n\nAlso, the author is taking control of her friendships, which can be seen as controlling. Whether the comment was a joke or not, the author's response is to end the friendship, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's actions (deleting messages) are problematic, but the author's response of cutting off the friend based on a single message might be overreacting. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe discussing boundaries with Jane would be better. The author's approach seems to be based on mistrust and jealousy, possibly without fully understanding the context of the joke. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's deletion of messages is an issue, the author's reaction is disproportionately harsh. He's making a decision to end a friendship because of a single, possibly innocent comment. That could be seen as the author being in the wrong because he's taking control and not allowing the girlfriend to handle the situation herself. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions are controlling and the reaction is excessive given the context.\n"
