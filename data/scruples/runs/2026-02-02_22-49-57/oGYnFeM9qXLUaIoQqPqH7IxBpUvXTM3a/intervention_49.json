She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this woman for three years. The author is okay with her talking to this coworker, Sam, who waves at her and is the only one he interacts with. The issue arises when the friend refers to another guy, Sam, as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive.\n\nThe author found out through the girlfriend's Fitbit that she had deleted messages. When confronted, she revealed the friend had made that comment. The author then tells his girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect their relationship. The author is not okay with the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone else, even if it's a joke or a work term.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. It's common for couples to have different comfort levels regarding friends and how they're addressed. The author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected by the friend using that term. But is cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke or comment a bit extreme?\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was possibly meant as a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. On the other hand, the author feels that the term is inappropriate and shows a lack of respect for their relationship. The author's jealousy or insecurity might be leading to an overreaction.\n\nThen there's the method of finding out\u2014using the Fitbit to check deleted messages. The girlfriend was unaware of this, so the author might have used a sneaky way to get information, which could affect trust. However, the user says the main point isn't about the phone usage but the reaction.\n\nIs the author right to cut off the friend entirely? Maybe there's a middle ground, like talking to the friend about the term instead of ending the friendship. Cutting someone off over a single incident without giving them a chance to explain or change their behavior could be seen as harsh. The author's approach seems more about controlling the girlfriend's social life based on his discomfort rather than addressing the actual issue with the friend.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the action taken might be too severe. The decision to end a long-term friendship based on one comment could be seen as the author overstepping, especially if the friend didn't intend harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the girlfriend to handle the situation or for not giving the friend a chance to address it. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
