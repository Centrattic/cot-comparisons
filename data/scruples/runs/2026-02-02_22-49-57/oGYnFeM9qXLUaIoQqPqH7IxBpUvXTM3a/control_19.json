She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a friend at work that's been there for over three years. The guy (the author) finds out that the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend\" in a message. The author then tells the gf he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because they don't respect him and the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the gf and her coworker have been friends for over three years. The coworker (Sam) is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work, but he does interact with the gf. The author was okay with that initially, trusting the gf. Then, through some deleted messages (which he found out via Fitbit data), he learned that the friend referred to another coworker as \"her boyfriend.\" The author then cuts off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend called another coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Jealousy vs. Respect**: The author's reaction is based on the idea that the friend didn't respect him as a partner. However, the friend's comment was about another coworker, not the author. The term \"boyfriend\" in this context might be a joke or a work-related term, not a real relationship. The author's gf also says she ignored the message, indicating it wasn't a big deal to her.\n\n2. **Communication and Understanding**: The author didn't talk to the friend first to address the issue. Instead, he decided to cut off the friendship immediately. The gf might have been in a better position to handle the situation with her friend, especially since they've known each other for years. The author's approach seems abrupt and possibly overreacting.\n\n3. **Trust Issues**: The author mentions that both he and the gf go through each other's phones. This behavior might contribute to a lack of trust. If the author is already in the habit of checking her phone, that could be a red flag in the relationship. However, in this case, the author used deleted messages found via Fitbit to confront her. The way he found out might affect the validity of his reaction. If the friend's comment was a joke, the author's response could be seen as too harsh.\n\n4. **Boundaries in Relationships**: In a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's friendships unless there's a legitimate issue. The friend's comment doesn't directly affect the author's relationship with the gf. Cutting off a long-time friend over a joke might be an overreaction. The author should have discussed it with his gf and maybe addressed it with the friend directly if it was a problem.\n\n5. **Power Dynamics**: The author is making a unilateral decision to end a friendship without the gf's input. The friend's comment isn't about the author, so using that as a reason to cut off the friendship might be controlling. It's possible the author is using this as a way to assert dominance rather than addressing the actual issue.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's reaction seems excessive. The friend's comment doesn't directly impact the relationship, and the author didn't handle it through open communication. Ending a three-year friendship over a joke could be seen as the author overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not the asshole), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The key is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the friend's comment was about another person and the author didn't address it properly, cutting off the friend seems like the wrong move. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, no. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, answer B. But considering the analysis, cutting off a friend over a joke is overreacting. So maybe answer A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, the options are A for yes (author is in the wrong) and B for no (author not in wrong). Hmm.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the analysis suggests that the author's reaction was too harsh and controlling, then the answer is A. But if the author's right to feel disrespected is valid, maybe B. But the friend's comment was about another coworker, not the author. The author is projecting his jealousy onto the friend. The friend didn't show disrespect to the author. The author is taking it as a personal attack. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
