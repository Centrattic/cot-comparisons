She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, let's say \"Friend A,\" for over three years. The author is okay with the friendship as long as Friend A doesn't talk to the girlfriend much. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and the author finds out through her Fitbit that there was a message where Friend A referred to another coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with Friend A because he considers that a disrespect.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is cutting off the friend because of a single message where Friend A called someone else \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on. The author is taking a strong stance, not allowing the friendship anymore. \n\nI need to consider if this reaction is justified. Trust is a big factor here. The author trusted the girlfriend's initial assertion that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. Then, when this message comes up, the author feels disrespected. But is the friend's comment really an issue? Calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a workplace context can be a joke or a way to refer to a close coworker, not necessarily a romantic term. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe it was just a harmless comment.\n\nThe author is cutting off the friend based on one instance. That seems a bit extreme. Also, the author is using the fact that the girlfriend deleted messages, which might indicate she's hiding something, but the messages she deleted were innocent. The author found out through the Fitbit, which might not be a reliable method, and then confronted the girlfriend. \n\nAnother angle: the author's reaction might be more about their own insecurities or overstepping boundaries. The friend's comment about Sam doesn't necessarily imply a romantic relationship. The author is assuming that the friend is being disrespectful by using the term \"boyfriend,\" but maybe it's just a figure of speech. \n\nAdditionally, the author's approach of cutting off the friend entirely over one comment could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Relationships between couples involve communication and mutual respect. The author might need to discuss their boundaries with the girlfriend and the friend rather than cutting ties without addressing the situation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author has a right to feel respected and might believe that the term \"boyfriend\" is crossing a line. However, the way they handled it\u2014cutting off the friend without giving them a chance to clarify\u2014could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to monitor messages raises privacy issues. Even if the messages were innocent, the method of finding out about them might be an invasion of the girlfriend's privacy, which complicates the situation.\n\nIn summary, the author's reaction seems harsh given the context. The friend's comment might not be as serious as the author thinks, and cutting off the friendship over it could be an overreaction. The author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more communication and understanding.\n"
