She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author is okay with the friendship initially, trusting the girlfriend's assurance that the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to many people. The conflict arises when the friend refers to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable and decides the girlfriend should no longer be friends with her.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. The author is expressing jealousy or discomfort with the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend,\" which might be a joke or a miscommunication. The girlfriend didn't object to the term, and the friend might not realize the term is problematic. The author's response is to cut off the friend entirely, which is a significant consequence for what might be a minor issue.\n\nThe author's actions involve not just expressing their feelings but taking a unilateral decision to end the friendship. The girlfriend's perspective is important here. If the friend's comment was a one-time joke and not indicative of a deeper issue, cutting off the friend might be an overreaction. The author's decision might stem from insecurity or jealousy, especially given the context of checking phones and having a history of on-again, off-again relationship dynamics. \n\nAdditionally, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to uncover deleted messages, which suggests a lack of trust. This history could imply that the author is acting from a place of controlling behavior rather than a legitimate concern about the friend's actions. The friend's statement about Sam being the \"boyfriend\" was corrected by the girlfriend, so there's no indication of infidelity or ongoing inappropriate behavior. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for coworkers to have playful or joking relationships, and terms like \"work boyfriend\" can be innocent. The author's response might be seen as overly possessive or not trusting the girlfriend's judgment in her friendship. The decision to cut off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize could damage the girlfriend's autonomy in her social life.\n\nOverall, while the author has valid feelings about being disrespected, the extreme reaction of ending the friendship over a single joke is likely inconsiderate of the girlfriend's needs and the context of the friendship. The author's actions might be seen as controlling and not proportionate to the issue at hand.\n"
