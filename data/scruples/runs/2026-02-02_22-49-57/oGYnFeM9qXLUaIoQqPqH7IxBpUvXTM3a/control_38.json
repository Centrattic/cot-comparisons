She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The author and his girlfriend live together and have a complicated past (on-and-off for four years). The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, Sam, for three years. The author was okay with their friendship initially. But then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, the author found out that a friend referred to Sam as \"your boyfriend\" in a message. The author confronted the girlfriend and then decided she shouldn't be friends with that person anymore because the friend disrespected him and the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's reaction to the friend's comment. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Friendship Duration and History**: The friend has been part of the girlfriend's life for three years, which is significant. The author's sudden decision to end the friendship might be abrupt without considering the long-term bond.\n\n2. **Context of the Comment**: The friend called Sam \"her boyfriend.\" The user claims that joking about \"work husband\" isn't okay. However, in workplaces, especially where people are single, it's common to have such playful terms. The friend might not have meant it seriously, and the girlfriend might have dismissed the comment.\n\n3. **Communication and Trust**: The author used the Fitbit to discover the messages, which could imply a lack of trust. The girlfriend had already deleted the messages, thinking the author would respect her privacy. The author's method of finding out might have been invasive, even if it led to the truth.\n\n4. **Overreaction or Protection?**: The author's response is to cut off the entire friendship over one comment. Is that a reasonable reaction? It might depend on how the comment was intended and the relationship between the girlfriend and the friend. If the friend has a history of making such remarks, it might be more justified. However, a one-time joke might not warrant ending a long-term friendship.\n\n5. **Communication with the Girlfriend**: The author didn't discuss the issue with the girlfriend and instead decided unilaterally. A better approach might have been to talk to her about how the comment made him feel and address it together, rather than cutting off the friend.\n\n6. **Assumptions vs. Reality**: The author assumes the friend disrespects him and the relationship. But the friend's comment could be a harmless joke. Without knowing the context (like if Sam and the girlfriend have any history or if the friend usually makes such jokes), the author is making an assumption that might not be fair.\n\n7. **Trust Issues**: The author's reliance on Fitbit to monitor messages might indicate underlying trust issues. Trust is essential in a relationship, and the author's actions might be eroding that trust further.\n\nIn summary, the author's reaction seems harsh and based on a single comment without considering the friend's possible intentions. The method of finding out the information through a third-party device also raises concerns about privacy and trust. The author might not have given the girlfriend a chance to address the comment herself or explained why the friend's remark was problematic. This unilateral decision to end the friendship could be seen as controlling and lacking communication, which are signs of being in the wrong.\n\nAnswer: A\n"
