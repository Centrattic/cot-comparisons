She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves his girlfriend (GF) and her coworker friend. The main issue is that the friend called another coworker her GF's \"boyfriend,\" which upset the author. He found out through his GF's Fitbit messages that this happened, even though she deleted the text messages. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because he feels disrespected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a long-term relationship, cohabiting for three months after being on and off for four years. The GF has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts minimally with her, which the author was okay with initially. Now, the coworker friend called another guy \"her boyfriend,\" leading to the author cutting off the friendship.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the friend disrespects him and their relationship. He believes the GF should have addressed the nickname directly. However, the GF claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author used the Fitbit data to find out about the deleted messages, leading him to take action.\n\nIs cutting off a friend over a single joke or nickname excessive? It depends on the context. If the nickname was meant as a joke and the GF didn't react, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author feels disrespected, it's valid to have boundaries. However, cutting off a long-time friend based on one instance might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended harm, and the GF didn't engage with it. The author's method of finding out via Fitbit could also affect the GF's trust, but the main issue is his reaction.\n\nAlso, the author is controlling by monitoring her phone and Fitbit, which might be a red flag. His actions suggest possessiveness, which can be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the friendship. If the friend's comment was a one-time joke and the GF handled it, maybe the author's reaction is unwarranted. Alternatively, if he feels the nickname undermines their relationship, it's his right to set boundaries. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards AITA because cutting off a friend over a minor issue without addressing it directly might be too extreme. The friend might not have realized it was offensive, and the GF didn't engage, so the author's response could be seen as disproportionate.\n"
