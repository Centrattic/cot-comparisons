She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The author found out that the friend referred to a male coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which he took issue with. He used the Fitbit to see deleted messages and confronted her. Now, he's cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The girlfriend didn't delete the messages to hide something harmful; they were mostly innocent. The friend's comment might have been a joke or a slip, but the author is taking it as a serious breach. However, the girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, so she didn't perpetuate it. \n\nIs the author overreacting? The friend's comment alone might not be a valid reason to end a friendship. The author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) shows a lack of trust, which could be problematic. Cutting off a long-term friend based on a minor joke seems harsh. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being infringed upon. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected. But is the friend's comment that big of a deal? It could be seen as harmless workplace banter. The author's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity rather than the friend's actual actions. Ending a friendship over a single instance may not be justified. \n\nSo, considering the actions taken and the context, the author's decision seems extreme. The real issue might be the lack of communication between the couple rather than the friend's comment. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
